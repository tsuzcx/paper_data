The transform orders for FrFT are adaptively set according to the intraframe pitch change rate. This method is motivated by the fact that the speech is not stationary even in a short period of time, and the idea is shown using an AM-FM speech model and some spectrograms of an artificial periodic signal. Experiments were conducted on the intervocalic English consonants provided by Interspeech 2008 Consonant Challenge and a Mandarin connected digits corpus. The performance of the proposed method is compared with the MFCC baseline system. Experimental results show that the proposed features get a slightly better recognition rate than MFCCs presumably because they can better track the dynamic characteristics of the speech harmonics.","doi":"10.1109/CHINSL.2008.ECP.60","publicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 6th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4730253/4730254/04730314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CHINSL.2008.ECP.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4730254","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Order Adaptation of the Fractional Fourier Transform Using the Intraframe Pitch Change Rate for Speech Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4730314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Order Adaptation of the Fractional Fourier Transform Using the Intraframe Pitch Change Rate for Speech Recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4730314/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439498","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4730314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Order Adaptation of the Fractional Fourier Transform Using the Intraframe Pitch Change Rate for Speech Recognition","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04704S","chronDate":"16-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4730253","isNumber":"4730254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4730253","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4730254","articleId":"4730314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4730347,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Song","affiliation":["Department of EEIS, University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Song","id":"37600647800"},{"name":"Lirong Dai","affiliation":["Department of EEIS, University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Lirong","lastName":"Dai","id":"37273869000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2942-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2943-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4730347","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4730347","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","NIST","Support vector machines","Kernel","Degradation","Training data","System performance","Natural languages","Speech","Mutual information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","Gaussian processes","speech recognition","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature selection","GMM-SVM","language recognition","discriminative training","Gaussian mixture model"]}],"abstract":"Discriminative training for language recognition has been a key tool for improving system performance.

We adopt a weighted Bayesian information criterion (BIC) to integrate boundary decisions from MFCC and LSP features in the speaker boundary confirmation stage. This multi-feature integration strategy makes use of the complementarity between perceptual features and articulatory features to achieve a performance gain.

Candidates of abandoned luggage items which may pose potential security threats are first identified and localized by our proposed foreground-mask sampling technique. Our approach can deal with luggage pieces of arbitrary shape and color without the need for prior learning, and it works well under crowded and highly-cluttered situations. This localization of suspicious luggage items in the scene enables us to focus attention and subsequent processing solely on their neighborhoods. The owner of the luggage is then located and tracked to determine whether or not the luggage has been abandoned deliberately. A probability model using the MAP principle is employed to calculate a posteriori confidence score for the luggage-abandonment event, and an alarm will be automatically triggered if the certainty of luggage abandonment is higher than a pre-defined threshold.

Background subtraction (BGS) is a commonly used technique for achieving this segmentation. The popularity of BGS largely comes from its computational efficiency, which allows applications such as human-computer interaction, video surveillance, and traffic monitoring to meet their real-time goals. Numerous BGS algorithms and a number of post-processing techniques that aim to improve the results of these algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, we evaluate several popular, state-of-the-art BGS algorithms and examine how post-processing techniques affect their performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that post-processing techniques can significantly improve the foreground segmentation masks produced by a BGS algorithm. We provide recommendations for achieving robust foreground segmentation based on the lessons learned performing this comparative study.","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2008.19","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/4730362/4730363/04730412.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2008.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4730363","startPage":"192","endPage":"199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Background Subtraction Algorithms with Post-Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4730412","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Background Subtraction Algorithms with Post-Processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4730412/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439582","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4730412/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Background Subtraction Algorithms with Post-Processing","confLoc":"Santa Fe, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"3341a192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064992S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4730362","isNumber":"4730363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4730362","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4730363","articleId":"4730412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4730414,"authors":[{"name":"Faisal Z.

Furthermore, compared to recognition based on static images, relatively few studies have been done for video based face recognition. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and comparison of face recognition using high quality and CCTV images in several important aspects: image quality (including resolution, noise, blurring and interlacing) as well as geometric transformations (such as translations, rotations and scale changes). The results show that holistic face recognition can be tolerant to image quality degradation but can also be highly influenced by geometric transformations. In addition, we show that camera intrinsics have much influence - when using different cameras for collecting gallery and probe images the recognition rate is considerably reduced. We also show that the classification performance can be considerably improved by straightforward averaging of consecutive face images from a CCTV video sequence.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Analysis of Face Recognition on Still and CCTV Images","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","doi":"10.1109/AVSS.2008.15","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Fifth International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance","pdfPath":"/iel5/4730362/4730363/04730432.pdf","startPage":"317","endPage":"324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AVSS.2008.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4730363","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4730432","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4730432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 Sept. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Analysis of Face Recognition on Still and CCTV Images","conferenceDate":"1-3 Sept. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4730432/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439602","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Analysis of Face Recognition on Still and CCTV Images","confLoc":"Santa Fe, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"3341a317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077085S","chronDate":"1-3 Sept. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4730362","isNumber":"4730363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4730362","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4730363","articleId":"4730432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4730596,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["Department of Guns Engineering, Ordnance Engineering College, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Peng Li","id":"37085948760"},{"name":"Guangfen Zhou","affiliation":["College of Sciences, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Guangfen Zhou","id":"37088185755"},{"name":"Ruilin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Guns Engineering, Ordnance Engineering College, Shijiazhuang, China"],"lastName":"Ruilin Wang","id":"37087817487"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3290-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3291-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4730596","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Design optimization","Genetic engineering","Reliability engineering","Design engineering","Neural networks","Acceleration","Educational institutions","Algorithm design and analysis","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","military computing","neural nets","weapons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global parameters optimization","large caliber sniper rifle","genetic algorithm","firing accuracy","neural network method","object function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Genetic algorithm","Optimization","Sniper Rifle"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4730596","abstract":"Large caliber sniper must satisfy several design requirements such as firing accuracy, reliability, weight limit and so on.

Traditional PID control becomes difficult to satisfy the necessity of improving the control performance of cold rolling mill. High precision, simple and effective control strategies are very important for the hydraulic AGC system of cold rolling mill. For the complex control problems, it is also desirable to integrate neural networks into fuzzy control so as to simplify and automate the specification of linguistic rules. This leads to good adaptation, good robustness and less dependency on the precise model of the control system. In the paper, a fuzzy neural networks control has been developed and applied to the screw-down mechanism control of hydraulic AGC system of cold rolling mill. The simulation experiment results verify the superiority of the proposed compound control to the conventional PID control in the static and dynamic control performance. The merits of both fuzzy control and artificial neural networks are well used in the hydraulic AGC system of aluminum cold rolling mill.","doi":"10.1109/ISKE.2008.4730905","startPage":"92","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISKE.2008.4730905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4730884","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711037/4730884/04730905.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy neural networks control for hydraulic AGC system of aluminum cold rolling mill","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4730905/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy neural networks control for hydraulic AGC system of aluminum cold rolling mill","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4730905/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10441095","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy neural networks control for hydraulic AGC system of aluminum cold rolling mill","confLoc":"Xiamen","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192008-00021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04959S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711037","isNumber":"4730884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711037","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4730884","articleId":"4730905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4730913,"authors":[{"name":"Shui-Li Chen","affiliation":["School of Science, Jimei University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Shui-Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"37535883700"},{"name":"Guo-Long Chen","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"lastName":"Guo-Long Chen","id":"37087456717"},{"name":"Yong-Li Niu","affiliation":["College of Mathematics and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"lastName":"Yong-Li Niu","id":"37087457816"},{"name":"Guo-Rong Cai","affiliation":["School of Science, Jimei University, Xiamen, Fujian, China"],"lastName":"Guo-Rong Cai","id":"37087457708"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2196-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2197-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4730913","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":76},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4730913","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Neurons","Fuzzy reasoning","Fuzzy systems","Intelligent systems","Intelligent networks","Knowledge engineering","Hydrocarbon reservoirs","Singular value decomposition","Petroleum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feature extraction","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","oil technology","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural network model","fuzzy clustering","fuzzy theory","BP neural network","hypostasis","feature extraction","oil-gas recognition","Tarim Oilfield"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy neural network","Hydrocarbon reservoir recognition","Fuzzy clustering","Transitive closure","BP network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISKE.2008.4730913","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711037/4730884/04730913.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering","startPage":"137","endPage":"140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4730884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISKE.2008.4730913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fuzzy neural network model based on fuzzy clustering and its applications","abstract":"Fuzzy neural network, which is based on fuzzy theory and BP neural network, plays an important role in practical.

With the optimized activation function, the rule extraction becomes much easier and simpler. Rule extraction has been experimented on two public datasets of iris and breast-cancer, which results showed that the proposed method has a better rule overcast accuracy than the commonly used methods, such as decision tree algorithm C4.5 and RX algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/ISKE.2008.4731052","startPage":"873","endPage":"879","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711037/4730884/04731052.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISKE.2008.4731052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4730884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rule extraction from artificial neural network with optimized activation functions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Clustering algorithms","Intelligent systems","Intelligent networks","Knowledge engineering","Mechanical engineering","Decision trees","Artificial intelligence","Backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["symbolic rule extraction","artificial neural network","optimized activation functions","weight-decay approach","error function","penalty term","decision tree algorithm","C4.5","RX algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["rule extraction","artificial neural network","optimized activation function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Rule extraction from artificial neural network with optimized activation functions","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4731052/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"17-19 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10441240","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rule extraction from artificial neural network with optimized activation functions","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192008-00168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056144S","chronDate":"17-19 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711037","isNumber":"4730884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711037","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4730884","articleId":"4731052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4731053,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Xie","affiliation":["School of Civil & Environment Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hui Xie","id":"37087512706"},{"name":"Li Liu","affiliation":["School of Civil & Environment Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Li Liu","id":"37089131207"},{"name":"Fei Ma","affiliation":["School of Civil & Environment Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Fei Ma","id":"37087597459"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2196-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2197-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4731053","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731053","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heat pumps","Artificial neural networks","Water heating","Refrigerants","Circuits","Space heating","Temperature","Knowledge engineering","Cooling","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","groundwater","heat pumps","multilayer perceptrons","power system analysis computing","renewable energy sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance prediction","ground-water heat pump system","artificial neural networks","multi-layered perception","back propagation","training process"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISKE.2008.4731053","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711037/4730884/04731053.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 3rd International Conference on Intelligent System and Knowledge Engineering","startPage":"880","endPage":"885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4730884","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISKE.2008.4731053","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance prediction of ground-water heat pump system using artificial neural networks","abstract":"This paper describes an application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict the performance of a ground-water heat pump system (GWHP).

Lots of techniques have been developed so far, mainly from statistical theory, still research is going on to find better solutions in terms of optimality and computational ease. Recently soft computing techniques are gaining popularity for solving real world problems for their more flexibility compared to statistical or mathematical techniques. In this work an algorithm based on particle swarm optimization with fuzzy fitness function has been proposed for getting optimal feature subset from a feature set with large number of features.

The cascade framework, is used to overcome the problem of overwhelmingly large number of samples and grossly imbalance of the positive and negative samples.

The classical eight kinds of affine transformations in 2-D fractal image compression were generalized to nineteen for the 3-D fractal image compression. Hyperspectral image date cube was first translated by 3-D wavelet and then the 3-D fractal compression coding was applied to lowest frequency subband. The remaining coefficients of higher frequency subbands were encoding by 3-D SPIHT. We use eight-fork tree division algorithm to improve the matching accuracy and reduce the time of fractal coding.

C-RAM is a phase change memory with a unique combination of features that collectively provide a high-density, low-power, non-volatile memory solution that is radiation hardened and meets rigorous reliability requirements. The device is now undergoing QML qualification in preparation for being flight production ready in early 2009. Flight qualified C- RAM will serve the critical need for rad hard non-volatile RAM in strategic space and military applications. Initial space radiation effects testing (heavy ion induced upset rates) demonstrate the robust nature of the device. No memory cell upsets were recorded and the majority of the observed upsets were soft errors (SE) induced in the sense amp circuits which are easily correctable with common error correcting code (ECC) algorithms. During the product development phase potential failure mechanisms associated with phase change memories such as proximity disturbs and drill-in effects were evaluated to determine whether they were legitimate concerns for C-RAM. These tests and other tests involving second order radiation effects, such as the effect of heavy ion radiation exposure on data retention lifetime were conducted. The results of these investigations further demonstrate the full capacity of the product technology. This paper will describe the C-RAM design and operation, and the results of the test and characterization of C-RAM devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731183/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4731183/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10439970","conferenceDate":"11-14 Nov. 2008","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 4-Mb Non-volatile Chalcogenide Random Access Memory designed for space applications: Project status update","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 4-Mb Non-volatile Chalcogenide Random Access Memory designed for space applications: Project status update","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12172008-00003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062228S","chronDate":"11-14 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731179","isNumber":"4731180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731179","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4731180","articleId":"4731183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4731184,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In cation-migration-based ionic memories, cations transport through solid electrolyte under electric field and deposit as metal atoms to form connecting bridge between two electrodes. With repeatable resistance change over several orders of magnitude and long retention, ionic memory is a promising candidate for next generation non-volatile memories. The advantages of ionic memories include low operation voltage and highly scalable device size. As two-terminal devices with hysteretic resistive behavior, ionic memories may enable novel architectures and algorithms. The major challenge for ionic memories exists in operation reliability.

The resistance change memory element is formed by a conductive metal oxide adjacent to an oxide tunnel barrier. Varying the as-deposited tunnel barrier thickness allows for control of the nominal current density and is targeted to meet the cell requirements for an ultra high density cross-point architecture. Excellent scaling of program and erase currents with electrode area and a continuous transition between program and erase state indicate that a uniform rather than a filamentary switching mechanism controls the device current both in the high and the low resistive state. A prior forming step is not required. The observed resistance change is caused by the exchange of oxygen ions between the conductive metal oxide and the tunnel oxide. Ion motion at room temperature is enabled by an exponential increase of the ion mobility under high electric fields during program and erase operations. The resistive switching effect of the device is explained by a change in the tunneling current due to an increase or decrease in effective tunnel barrier height. The barrier height varies due to changes in charge within the barrier as a result of oxygen ions moving in to or out of the tunnel barrier.","doi":"10.1109/NVMT.2008.4731194","publicationTitle":"2008 9th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium (NVMTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium (NVMTS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731179/4731180/04731194.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMT.2008.4731194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oxide dual-layer memory element for scalable non-volatile cross-point memory technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Oxide dual-layer memory element for scalable non-volatile cross-point memory technology","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10439981","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4731194/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731194/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"11-14 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oxide dual-layer memory element for scalable non-volatile cross-point memory technology","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12172008-00014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062221S","chronDate":"11-14 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731179","isNumber":"4731180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731179","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4731180","articleId":"4731194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4731195,"authors":[{"name":"C.

To explain this degradation, we first develop a 2D TCAD cell simulation to watch attentively what happens in the channel where measurements are impossible. Some phenomena are shown here which could begin to explain what occurs. Because of continual shrinking, coupling capacitances between cells in the array have a significant impact on the cell behaviour. The previous simulation can be completed by taking into account these 3D parasitic capacitances which have been extracted in a second time.","doi":"10.1109/NVMT.2008.4731200","publicationTitle":"2008 9th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium (NVMTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th Annual Non-Volatile Memory Technology Symposium (NVMTS)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731179/4731180/04731200.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMT.2008.4731200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731180","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731200","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Full TCAD simulation and 3D parasitic capacitances extraction in 90nm NAND flash memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731200/","displayDocTitle":"A Full TCAD simulation and 3D parasitic capacitances extraction in 90nm NAND flash memories","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4731200/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"11-14 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10439987","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Full TCAD simulation and 3D parasitic capacitances extraction in 90nm NAND flash memories","confLoc":"Pacific Grove, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12172008-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039891S","chronDate":"11-14 Nov. 2008","isNumber":"4731180","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731179","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4731200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4731242,"authors":[{"name":"Sooyong Kang","affiliation":["Division of Information and Communications, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4877616/4731242/4731242-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sooyong Kang received the BS degree in mathematics and the MS and PhD degrees in computer science from Seoul National University (SNU), Korea, in 1996, 1998, and 2002, respectively.

To overcome these problems, various flash-aware strategies have been suggested in terms of buffer cache, file system, FTL, and others. Also, the recent development of next-generation nonvolatile memory types such as MRAM, FeRAM, and PRAM provide higher commercial value to non-volatile RAM (NVRAM). At today's prices, however, they are not yet cost-effective. In this paper, we suggest the utilization of small-sized, next-generation NVRAM as a write buffer to improve the .overall performance of NAND flash memory-based storage systems. We propose various block-based NVRAM write buffer management policies and evaluate the performance improvement of NAND flash memory-based storage systems under each policy. Also, we propose a novel write buffer-aware flash translation layer algorithm, optimistic FTL, which is designed to harmonize well with NVRAM write buffers. Simulation results show that the proposed buffer management policies outperform the traditional page-based LRU algorithm and the proposed optimistic FTL outperforms previous log block-based FTL algorithms, such as BAST and FAST.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731242/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"58","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10601573","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4731242/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Performance Trade-Offs in Using NVRAM Write Buffer for Flash Memory-Based Storage Devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Trade-Offs in Using NVRAM Write Buffer for Flash Memory-Based Storage Devices","sourcePdf":"ttc2009060744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120835S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4877616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4877616","articleId":"4731242","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4731246,"authors":[{"name":"Doruk Bozdag","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/4895668/4731246/4731246-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Doruk Bozdag received the BS degrees in electrical and electronic engineering and physics from Bodazici University, Turkey, in 2002, and the MS degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Ohio State University in 2005.

To address this problem, we propose a generic algorithm, SC, to minimize the processor requirement of any given valid schedule. SC preserves the schedule length of the original schedule and reduces processor count by merging processor schedules and removing redundant duplicate tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to address this highly unexplored aspect of DAG scheduling. On average, SC reduced the processor requirement 91, 82, and 72 percent for schedules generated by PLW, TCSD, and CPFD algorithms, respectively. SC algorithm has a low complexity (O{N}\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) compared to most duplication-based algorithms. Moreover, it decouples processor economization from schedule length minimization problem. To take advantage of these features of SC, we also propose a scheduling algorithm SDS, having the same time complexity as SC. Our experiments demonstrate that schedules generated by SDS are only 3 percent longer than CPFD (O{N}\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sup>\n), one of the best algorithms in that respect. SDS and SC together form a two-stage scheduling algorithm that produces schedules with high quality and low processor requirement, and has lower complexity than the comparable algorithms that produce similar high-quality results.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2008.260","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/4895668/04731246.pdf","startPage":"857","endPage":"871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2008.260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4895668","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compaction of Schedules and a Two-Stage Approach for Duplication-Based DAG Scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Compaction of Schedules and a Two-Stage Approach for Duplication-Based DAG Scheduling","volume":"20","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10601747","htmlLink":"/document/4731246/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compaction of Schedules and a Two-Stage Approach for Duplication-Based DAG Scheduling","sourcePdf":"ttd2009060857.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108596S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"4895668","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4895668","articleId":"4731246","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4731255,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/69/5210266/4731255/4731255-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bo Chen received the BEng, MEng, and PhD degrees in electronic engineering from Xidian University in 2003, 2006, and 2008, respectively.

Traditional WLAN medium-access-control (MAC) protocols assume that only one station can transmit at a time: simultaneous transmissions of more than one station cause the destruction of all packets involved. By exploiting recent advances in PHY-layer multiuser detection (MUD) techniques, it is possible for a receiver to receive multiple packets simultaneously. This paper argues that such multipacket reception (MPR) capability can greatly enhance the capacity of future WLANs. In addition, the paper provides the MAC-layer and PHY-layer designs needed to achieve the improved capacity. First, to demonstrate MPR as a powerful capacity-enhancement technique, we prove a \"superlinearityrdquo result, which states that the system throughput per unit cost increases as the MPR capability increases. Second, we show that the commonly deployed binary exponential backoff (BEB) algorithm in today's WLAN MAC may not be optimal in an MPR system, and the optimal backoff factor increases with the MPR capability, the number of packets that can be received simultaneously. Third, based on the above insights, we design a joint MAC-PHY layer protocol for an IEEE 802.11-like WLAN that incorporates advanced PHY-layer signal processing techniques to implement MPR.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2008.169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4957664/04731256.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2008.169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4957664","startPage":"923","endPage":"935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How Does Multiple-Packet Reception Capability Scale the Performance of Wireless Local Area Networks?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"How Does Multiple-Packet Reception Capability Scale the Performance of Wireless Local Area Networks?","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731256/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10664233","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4731256/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Does Multiple-Packet Reception Capability Scale the Performance of Wireless Local Area Networks?","sourcePdf":"ttm2009070923.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073479S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4957664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4957664","articleId":"4731256","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4731257,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyuan Ta","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, National ICT, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/4957664/4731257/4731257-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyuan Ta received the bachelor's degree in physics from Peking University in 2003 and the master's degree in telecommunications in 2005 from the University of Sydney, Australia, where he is currently working toward the PhD degree in telecommunications.

This result also applies to mobile networks where nodes always move randomly and independently. Our simulations show that to achieve a good accuracy, n should be larger than 200 when k = 1 and d = 1; and n should be larger than 600 when k les 3 and d = 2, 3.

In this paper, we consider the design of a heterogeneous mobile ad hoc network (MANET) consisting of two kinds of mobile nodes-traditional nodes with limited energy and a few controllable mobile relay nodes with relatively abundant energy resources. We propose a novel relay deployment framework that utilizes mobility prediction and works in tandem with the underlying MANET routing protocol to optimally define the movement of the relay nodes. We present two instances of the relay deployment problem, together with the solutions, to achieve different goals. Instance 1, termed Min-Total, aims to minimize the total energy consumed across all the traditional nodes during data transmission, while instance 2, termed Min-Max, aims to minimize the maximum energy consumed by a traditional node during data transmission. Our solutions also enable the prioritization of individual nodes in the network based on residual energy profiles and contextual significance. We perform an extensive simulation study to understand the trade-offs involved in deploying an increasing fraction of such relay nodes in the network. We also investigate the performance of the proposed framework under different mobility prediction schemes. Results indicate that even when the relay nodes constitute a small fraction of the total nodes in the network, the proposed framework results in significant energy savings. Further, we observed that while both the schemes have their potential advantages, the differences between the two optimization schemes are clearly highlighted in a sparse network.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2008.174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4816111/04731261.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2008.174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4816111","startPage":"750","endPage":"765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Mobility-Prediction-Based Relay Deployment Framework for Conserving Power in MANETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Mobility-Prediction-Based Relay Deployment Framework for Conserving Power in MANETs","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731261/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10587488","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4731261/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Mobility-Prediction-Based Relay Deployment Framework for Conserving Power in MANETs","sourcePdf":"ttm2009060750.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114164S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4816111","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4816111","articleId":"4731261","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4731265,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaogang Wang","affiliation":["Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/4758536/4731265/4731265-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaogang Wang received the BS degree in electrical engineering and information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, in 2001 and the MS degree in information engineering from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, in 2004.

Hierarchical Bayesian models are used to connect three elements in visual surveillance: low-level visual features, simple \"atomic\" activities, and interactions. Atomic activities are modeled as distributions over low-level visual features, and multi-agent interactions are modeled as distributions over atomic activities. These models are learnt in an unsupervised way. Given a long video sequence, moving pixels are clustered into different atomic activities and short video clips are clustered into different interactions. In this paper, we propose three hierarchical Bayesian models, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) mixture model, Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) mixture model, and Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Dual-HDP) model. They advance existing language models, such as LDA [1] and HDP [2]. Our data sets are challenging video sequences from crowded traffic scenes and train station scenes with many kinds of activities co-occurring. Without tracking and human labeling effort, our framework completes many challenging visual surveillance tasks of board interest such as: (1) discovering typical atomic activities and interactions; (2) segmenting long video sequences into different interactions; (3) segmenting motions into different activities; (4) detecting abnormality; and (5) supporting high-level queries on activities and interactions.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.87","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/4758536/04731265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4758536","startPage":"539","endPage":"555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unsupervised Activity Perception in Crowded and Complicated Scenes Using Hierarchical Bayesian Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised Activity Perception in Crowded and Complicated Scenes Using Hierarchical Bayesian Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731265/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10428846","pubMedId":"19147880","dateOfInsertion":"23 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4731265/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised Activity Perception in Crowded and Complicated Scenes Using Hierarchical Bayesian Models","sourcePdf":"ttp2009030539.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085428S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"4758536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"210","xplore-issue":"4758536","articleId":"4731265","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4731267,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Zhao","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5370684/4731267/4731267-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Qi Zhao received the BS degree in computer science from Zhejiang University, China, in 2004.

Its computational complexity, however, prevents a direct use in many applications. This paper proposes a novel differential EMD (DEMD) algorithm based on the sensitivity analysis of the simplex method and offers a speedup at orders of magnitude compared with its brute-force counterparts. The DEMD algorithm is discussed and empirically verified in the visual tracking context. The deformations of the distributions for objects at different time instances are accommodated well by the EMD, and the differential algorithm makes the use of EMD in real-time tracking possible. To further reduce the computation, signatures, i.e., variable-size descriptions of distributions, are employed as an object representation. The new algorithm models and estimates local background scenes as well as foreground objects to handle scale changes in a principled way. Extensive quantitative evaluation of the proposed algorithm has been carried out using benchmark sequences and the improvement over the standard mean shift tracker is demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2008.299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel5/34/5370684/04731267.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2008.299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5370684","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Earth Mover's Distance with Its Applications to Visual Tracking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731267/","displayDocTitle":"Differential Earth Mover's Distance with Its Applications to Visual Tracking","volume":"32","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11049965","pubMedId":"20075458","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4731267/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Earth Mover's Distance with Its Applications to Visual Tracking","sourcePdf":"ttp2010020274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085328S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"5370684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5370684","articleId":"4731267","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4731268,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Grompone von Gioi","affiliation":["CMLA, ENS Cachan, CNRS, Universite Paris Sud, Cachan, France","IIE, Facultad de Ingenieria, Universidad de la Republica, Uruguay"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/5420323/4731268/4731268-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rafael Grompone von Gioi received the BSc degree from the Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, Uruguay, in 2004 and the MSc degree from the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan, France, in 2006.

POS tagging is a very important preprocessing task for language processing activities. This paper reports about task of POS tagging for Bengali using support vector machine (SVM). The POS tagger has been developed using a tagset of 26 POS tags, defined for the Indian languages. The system makes use of the different contextual information of the words along with the variety of features that are helpful in predicting the various POS classes. The POS tagger has been trained, and tested with the 72,341, and 20 K wordforms, respectively. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed SVM based POS tagger with an accuracy of 86.84%. Results show that the lexicon, named entity recognizer and different word suffixes are effective in handling the unknown word problems and improve the accuracy of the POS tagger significantly. Comparative evaluation results have demonstrated that this SVM based system outperforms the three existing systems based on the hidden markov model (HMM), maximum entropy (ME) and conditional random field (CRF).","doi":"10.1109/ICIT.2008.12","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731276/4731277/04731308.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIT.2008.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731277","startPage":"106","endPage":"111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Part of Speech Tagging in Bengali Using Support Vector Machine","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Part of Speech Tagging in Bengali Using Support Vector Machine","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731308/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10440013","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4731308/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Part of Speech Tagging in Bengali Using Support Vector Machine","confLoc":"Bhubaneswar, India","sourcePdf":"3513a106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050451S","chronDate":"17-20 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731276","isNumber":"4731277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731276","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"4731277","articleId":"4731308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4731404,"authors":[{"name":"Wenfeng Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronics & Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Wenfeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37656669000"},{"name":"Zuntong Wang","affiliation":["College of Electronics & Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zuntong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291899500"},{"name":"Fei Qiao","affiliation":["College of Electronics & Information Engineering, University of Tongji, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37086540824"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3498-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3746-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4731404","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731404","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Vehicles","Routing","Equations","Automobiles","Biological cells","Encoding","Biological system modeling","Evolution (biology)","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","vehicle routing problem","crossover operator","crossover strategy","soft time window","searching time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heuristic algorithm","the vehicle routing problem","time window","crossover operator"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.161","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731351/4731352/04731404.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology","startPage":"189","endPage":"194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Genetic Algorithm for Vehicle Routing Problem with Time-Window","abstract":"To overcome the common defects of early convergence in the existing genetic algorithm, an improved genetic algorithm with new crossover operator and new crossover strategy was presented for the solution to the vehicle routing problem with soft time window (VRPTW).

The new method is looking forward to. This paper presents a fast, simple and robust classifier, in which the winner has been traced and marked during entire training. We named it as Winner Trace Marking (WTM). The basic structure is based on self organizing feather map (SOFM), but the training and recognizing rules are changed and optimized.

If numbers of targets and sensors are very large, the scale of the problem may be too large to solve using traditional methods. A method based on modified particle swarm optimization algorithm (MPSO) is proposed to solve the problem. Firstly, extended Kalman filter (EKF) is adopted for target tracking, and based on the tracking model, a mathematical model is founded to formulate the problem. Then MPSO is designed based on operator redefinition that modifies standard PSO to suit with this problem. Finally, feasibility and efficiency of the method presented are verified through numerical experiments by comparing it with a genetic algorithm (GA) based method and a rule-based method.","doi":"10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.198","startPage":"156","endPage":"159","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731351/4731550/04731593.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731550","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor Scheduling for Target Tracking in a Wireless Sensor Network Using Modified Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Target tracking","Particle swarm optimization","State estimation","Sensor systems","Processor scheduling","Mathematical model","Particle tracking","Costs","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","particle swarm optimisation","scheduling","target tracking","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensor scheduling","target tracking","wireless sensor network","modified particle swarm optimization algorithm","extended Kalman filter","mathematical model","genetic algorithm","rule-based method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sensor scheduling","target tracking","modified particle swarm optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sensor Scheduling for Target Tracking in a Wireless Sensor Network Using Modified Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4731593/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10440274","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor Scheduling for Target Tracking in a Wireless Sensor Network Using Modified Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3498b156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043594S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731351","isNumber":"4731550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731351","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4731550","articleId":"4731593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4731600,"authors":[{"name":"Yijun Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Yijun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37655743300"},{"name":"Pinghua Chen","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Pinghua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37559816000"},{"name":"Guobo Xie","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Guobo","lastName":"Xie","id":"37649887500"},{"name":"Zhusong Liu","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Zhusong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37652329900"},{"name":"Zhenkun Li","affiliation":["Faculty of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Zhenkun","lastName":"Li","id":"37558162700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3498-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3746-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4731600","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":176},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coprocessors","Cryptography","Application specific integrated circuits","Mathematics","Information security","Computer networks","Switches","Data security","Computer science","Logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","asynchronous circuits","coprocessors","cryptography","logic design","low-power electronics","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power asynchronous DES coprocessor","sensor network encryption","asynchronous logic style design","data encryption standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DES","Encryption","Coprocessor","Low-power","Asynchronous"]}],"abstract":"Sensor network nodes have a very tight power budget and the power efficiency is the biggest design concern in sensor network circuits. A general-purpose processor (e.g. an ARM processor) is not efficient to execute encryption algorithms because it has no special instructions to support encryption operations, for example very often-used permutation operations. In the paper, we propose a low-power ASIC encryption coprocessor for sensor network nodes. A DES algorithm is used because the algorithm does not include power-hungry and complex mathematic operations, such as multiplication, division and addition. An asynchronous logic style is used to design the coprocessor. With an asynchronous controller, a global clock is not necessary when idle, resulting in zero standby dynamic power. Using the DES coprocessor, the power consumed by encryption can be saved by 4 orders of magnitude than a pure software calculation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Design of a Low-Power Asynchronous DES Coprocessor for Sensor Network Encryption","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology","doi":"10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.228","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Computer Science and Computational Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731351/4731550/04731600.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"193","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCSCT.2008.228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731550","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"The Design of a Low-Power Asynchronous DES Coprocessor for Sensor Network Encryption","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4731600/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10440281","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Design of a Low-Power Asynchronous DES Coprocessor for Sensor Network Encryption","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3498b190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036646S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731351","isNumber":"4731550","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731351","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4731550","articleId":"4731600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4731613,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Zhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37657027500"},{"name":"Hao Xu","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536044700"},{"name":"Wuliang Peng","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Shenyang Ligong University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Wuliang","lastName":"Peng","id":"37532212300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3498-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3746-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4731613","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":618},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Encoding","Processor scheduling","Availability","Decoding","NP-hard problem","Heuristic algorithms","Computer science","Mechanical engineering","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","genetic algorithms","minimisation","project management","resource allocation","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","renewable resource constrained project scheduling problem","make-span minimization","precedence constraint","resource availability","priority-based encoding scheme","permutation-based encoding scheme","serial generation scheme","decoding","project plan generation","factorial computational experiment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["genetic algorithm","project scheduling","resource constrained project scheduling problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731613","abstract":"A genetic algorithm (GA) was proposed to solve the resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP), in which resources are renewable and there is a single mode to perform each activity.

With the increasing concern of fossil fuel reserves and the environmental aspects, the 2005 International Future Energy Challenge, sponsored by U.S. the Department of Energy and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, required that the grid-connected inverter should provide a single-phase utility line with 110-240 V at either 50/60 Hz. The proposed series and parallel output DBHBI can produce those kinds of voltage by series or parallel connection of two inverters and with digital signal processor (DSP) control to meet the aforementioned specifications. The load current of the two inverters at parallel output association and the load voltage of both at series output association can be shared. The waveform quality of the whole output voltage is high at both associations. Stability and relative stability of the inverter are unaffected at the two output associations. Operating principle, control strategy, stability and relative stability, and design guidelines and examples are illustrated. Experimental results of a 1-kVA DSP-based series and parallel output DBHBI at stand-alone mode verify the theoretical analysis. The comparisons between single and double inverter structures show that the proposed inverter is very promising in applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4731748/","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10475284","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Control Strategy for Series and Parallel Output Dual-Buck Half Bridge Inverters Based on DSP Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control Strategy for Series and Parallel Output Dual-Buck Half Bridge Inverters Based on DSP Control","sourcePdf":"tpel-yao-2007117.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078627S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"4783511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"4783511","articleId":"4731748","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4731765,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaofang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37281388000"},{"name":"Swetha Thota","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Swetha","lastName":"Thota","id":"37658759300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3748-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"4731765","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Network-on-a-chip","Computer architecture","Topology","Application software","Scalability","Hardware","Integrated circuit interconnections","Circuit simulation","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design","logic design","multiprocessing systems","network routing","network topology","network-on-chip","packet switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource-efficient communication architecture","multiprocessor","single FPGA chip","packet-switching network-on-chip","processing element","NoC design","PE-router topology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGAs","network-on-chip","multiprocessor"]}],"abstract":"Recent significant advancements in FPGAs have made it viable to explore multiprocessor solutions on a single FPGA chip. An efficient communication architecture that matches the needs of the target application is always critical to the overall performance of multiprocessors. Packet-switching network-on-chip (NoC) approaches are being offered to deal with scalability and complexity challenges coming along with the increasing number of processing elements (PEs). Many FPGA-based NoC designs consume significant resources, leaving little room for PEs. We argue that computation is still the primary task of multiprocessors and sufficient resources should be reserved for PEs. This paper presents our novel design and implementation of a resource-efficient communication architecture for multiprocessors on FPGAs. We reduce not only the required number of routers for a given number of PEs by introducing a new PE-router topology, but also resource requirements of each router, while maintaining good performance for typical injection rates.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.57","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","startPage":"25","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Resource-Efficient Communication Architecture for Multiprocessors on FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of a Resource-Efficient Communication Architecture for Multiprocessors on FPGAs","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731765/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452455","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4731765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of a Resource-Efficient Communication Architecture for Multiprocessors on FPGAs","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3474a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058313S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731750","isNumber":"4731751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731750","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4731751","articleId":"4731765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4731767,"authors":[{"name":"Anders Kj\u00e6r-Nielsen","affiliation":["The M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Kj\u00e6r-Nielsen","id":"38357554800"},{"name":"Lars Baunegaard With Jensen","affiliation":["The M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Lars Baunegaard With","lastName":"Jensen","id":"38294107500"},{"name":"Anders Stengaard S\u00f8rensen","affiliation":["The M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Anders Stengaard","lastName":"S\u00f8rensen","id":"38252874100"},{"name":"Norbert Kr\u00fcger","affiliation":["The M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Institute, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Kr\u00fcger","id":"37546662200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3748-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"4731767","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Embedded system","Stereo vision","Field programmable gate arrays","Cameras","Image resolution","Delay","Hardware","Coprocessors","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time embedded system","stereo vision preprocessing","FPGA","region of interest"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Stereo Vision Preprocessing","Real-time","Embedded","FireWire","1394a"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a low level vision processing node for use in existing IEEE 1394 camera setups is presented.

With the help of experimental results we have analyzed the alteration in the MFPGA area with different LUT and cluster sizes. We have shown that in general LUTs having 4 or 5 inputs and clusters having 4 or 5 LUTs per cluster produce most efficient results in terms of area for the tree based architecture.

A set of DSP test-benches are used to show the effectiveness of various techniques used in this work.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.53","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731781.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.53","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Methodology and Tools for Exploring Domain-Specific Coarse-Grained FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Methodology and Tools for Exploring Domain-Specific Coarse-Grained FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4731781/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452471","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Methodology and Tools for Exploring Domain-Specific Coarse-Grained FPGAs","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3474a121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055565S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731750","isNumber":"4731751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731750","xplore-issue":"4731751","articleId":"4731781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4731783,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Degryse","affiliation":["ELIS Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Degryse","id":"37658774000"},{"name":"Karel Bruneel","affiliation":["ELIS Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Karel","lastName":"Bruneel","id":"37658773600"},{"name":"Harald Devos","affiliation":["ELIS Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Devos","id":"37598842200"},{"name":"Dirk Stroobandt","affiliation":["ELIS Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Stroobandt","id":"37347522100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3748-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"4731783","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loop Transformations to Reduce the Dynamic FPGA Recon?guration Overhead","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731783.pdf","startPage":"133","endPage":"138","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.25","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Runtime","Acceleration","Application specific integrated circuits","Time to market","Costs","Computer bugs","Microprogramming","Circuit synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","matrix multiplication","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix multiplication benchmark","dynamic hardware generation technique","parameterizable configuration","FPGA reconfiguration overhead","field programmable gate array","loop transformation","temporal data locality optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGAs","Loop transformations","Dynamic hardware generation","Matrix multiplications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731783","abstract":"Dynamic hardware generation reduces the number of FPGA resources needed and speeds up an application by optimizing the FPGA configuration at run-time for the exact problem at hand.

Partial reconfiguration can be used to maximize the resource utilization in these FPGAs. Current methodologies use both external and self partial reconfiguration for this purpose. On mature multichip (MC) systems that have not made use of the PR features of their SRAM-based FPGA(s), however, these methodologies would require changes in the existing FPGA configuration protocol and/or associated hardware outside the array. This paper presents a novel methodology that makes PR features available to these systems for the purpose of maximizing their FPGA resources without the modifications required by the current methodologies. The proposed methodology reuses an existing data interface to send the PR data to the array and directs this data to the FPGApsilas internal configuration port. A prototype of this methodology is demonstrated on a commercial color space conversion (CSC) engine design using two Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGAs.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731784.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leveraging Firmware in Multichip Systems to Maximize FPGA Resources: An Application of Self-Partial Reconfiguration","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.81","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Leveraging Firmware in Multichip Systems to Maximize FPGA Resources: An Application of Self-Partial Reconfiguration","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452474","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4731784/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leveraging Firmware in Multichip Systems to Maximize FPGA Resources: An Application of Self-Partial Reconfiguration","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3474a139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054832S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731750","isNumber":"4731751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731750","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4731751","articleId":"4731784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4731796,"authors":[{"name":"Yana E.

Because of their reconfigurability, FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays) can be configured with an optimized configuration every time these parameter values change. This results in configurations that are smaller and faster than their generic counterparts. Unfortunately, the overhead involved in generating these configurations at run-time with conventional tools is very large. However, if the incoming tasks only differ in a set of parameter values, the use of Tunable LUT (TLUT) circuits can drastically reduce this overhead. A TLUT circuit is a LUT circuit in which the truth tables of the LUTs are expressed as a function of a set of parameters. At run-time the truth tables for a specific set of parameter values can rapidly be calculated by evaluating these functions. Up to now TLUT circuits had to be designed manually resulting in a huge design cost. This paper introduces TMAP2, a software tool based on conventional structural mapping that automatically generates a TLUT circuit starting from an arbitrary Boolean circuit.We have tested TMAP2 on a set of 12 micro-benchmarks and we show a substantial reduction in both the circuits area and maximum depth compared to conventional implementations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731798/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452488","htmlLink":"/document/4731798/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurability-Aware Structural Mapping for LUT-Based FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurability-Aware Structural Mapping for LUT-Based FPGAs","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3474a223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050205S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731750","isNumber":"4731751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731750","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4731751","articleId":"4731798","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4731801,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Baunegaard With Jensen","affiliation":["University of Southern Denmark, The M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Institute, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Lars Baunegaard With","lastName":"Jensen","id":"38294107500"},{"name":"Anders Kj\u00e6r-Nielsen","affiliation":["University of Southern Denmark, The M\u00e6rsk Mc-Kinney M\u00f8ller Institute, Odense, Denmark"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Kj\u00e6r-Nielsen","id":"38357554800"},{"name":"Javier D\u00edaz Alonso","affiliation":["Dept.

This introduces new design challenges, such as the need for portable programming models across HPRCs, and system-level verification tools. In this paper, we extend previous work on TMD-MPI to include an MPI-based approach to exchange data between X86 processors and hardware engines inside FPGAs that improves design portability by hiding vendor-specific communication details. Also, we have created a tool called the message-passing simulation framework (MSF) that we use to develop TMD-MPI itself as well as an application development tool that enables an FPGA in simulation to exchange messages with other X86 processors. As an example, we simulate a LINPACK benchmark hardware core using an Intel-FSB-FPGA platform to quickly prototype the hardware, to test the communications and to verify the benchmark results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731805.pdf","startPage":"265","endPage":"270","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Message-Passing Hardware/Software Co-simulation Environment to Aid in Reconfigurable Computing Design Using TMD-MPI","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Engines","Software testing","Computational modeling","Application software","Benchmark testing","System testing","Virtual prototyping","Software debugging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","message passing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["message-passing hardware/software cosimulation environment","reconfigurable computing design","TMD-MPI","high-performance reconfigurable computers","FPGA","field programmable gate arrays","system-level verification tools","data exchange"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Simulation","High-Performance","Reconfigurable","MPI","Message-Passing","Parallel Programming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Message-Passing Hardware/Software Co-simulation Environment to Aid in Reconfigurable Computing Design Using TMD-MPI","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4731805/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452495","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Message-Passing Hardware/Software Co-simulation Environment to Aid in Reconfigurable Computing Design Using TMD-MPI","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3474a265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063781S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731750","isNumber":"4731751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731750","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4731751","articleId":"4731805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4731806,"authors":[{"name":"Simon Banks","affiliation":["Simba HPC Limited, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Banks","id":"37661611100"},{"name":"Philip Beadling","affiliation":["Simba HPC Limited, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Philip","lastName":"Beadling","id":"37659105000"},{"name":"Andras Ferencz","affiliation":["Simba HPC Limited, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"Andras","lastName":"Ferencz","id":"37653553600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3748-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"4731806","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":604},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Random number generation","Finance","Instruments","Monte Carlo methods","Throughput","High performance computing","Physics computing","Stochastic processes","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","finance","mainframes","microcomputers","Monte Carlo methods","random number generation","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","pseudo random number generators","Monte Carlo methods","quantitative finance","general purpose processor systems","PC","mainframes","Mersenne twister","generalized feedback shift registers","fixed precision integers","high performance computing","computational finance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Monte Carlo Methods in Finance","Pseudo Random Number","Mersenne Twister"]}],"abstract":"FPGA based implementations of two classes of pseudo random number(PRN) generator, intended for use in Monte Carlo methods for finance, are presented.

The second class is based on multiplication of fixed precision integers (with overflow). In both cases we compare a high quality generator and a generator with minimal resource usage. Comparisons of FPGA resource usage, data throughput and the quality of the generated series are given with a view to applications in high performance computing (HPC) for computational finance.

The hardware accelerator includes multiple arithmetic comparison and absolute difference units, as well as a customized memory organization. The proposed micro-organization was instantiated using a XA3S500E Spartan 3E FPGA device.

For each sub-pixel, the values of four neighbors are used to compute the interpolated value. This presents a challenge since four pixels must be read from the source image memory for each output pixel. This paper presents an architecture, for implementation within FPGA-based vision systems, that takes advantage of the heterogeneous resources available on modern devices to parallelize these memory accesses through efficient distribution of the source image in embedded memories. We show how intrinsic information in the sub-pixel addresses can be used to implement bilinear interpolation efficiently. We then suggest modifications to the architecture for larger image sizes which exceed the memory capabilities of modern FPGAs. The architecture is shown to achieve performance of 250Msamples per second in a modern device.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.15","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731816.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalised Parallel Bilinear Interpolation Architecture for Vision Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731816/","displayDocTitle":"Generalised Parallel Bilinear Interpolation Architecture for Vision Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452506","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4731816/","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalised Parallel Bilinear Interpolation Architecture for Vision Systems","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3474a331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033748S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731750","isNumber":"4731751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731750","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4731751","articleId":"4731816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4731819,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37653652900"},{"name":"Chien-Hsun Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Chien-Hsun","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37275611300"},{"name":"Marina Cole","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Cole","id":"37267460600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3748-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"4731819","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"abstract":"An FPGA implementation of a hybrid algorithm developed for target motion estimation in a wideband sonar echolocation system is presented in this paper. The compact and fast hardware architecture consists of three parts: discrete wavelet transform (DWT) filtering bank, scale optimizer and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) convolver. The algorithm initially makes use of an intelligent fuzzy system for adaptive noise cancellation, output of which is processed by the DWT filtering bank employed to further minimize the remaining noise part of the training data thus fine tuning the contact signal. The DWT denoising output is then processed by an optimal CWT convolver in order to estimate targetpsilas motion including Doppler and delay. The echolocation system was evaluated using Morlet wavelet as the transmitted signal and with the target strength of approximately -30 dB. The targetpsilas motion is estimated with 0.001 s accuracy in time domain demonstrating the capability of the FPGA architecture to provide an efficient and accurate solution in sonar signal applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and

We propose an enhanced TRNG that does not require post-processing to pass statistical tests and with better randomness characteristics on the output. We have shown by experiment that the frequencies of the equal length oscillator rings in the TRNG are not identical but different due to the placement of the inverters in the FPGA. We have implemented our proposed TRNG in an Altera Cyclone II FPGA.

The architecture, based on the montgomery modular multiplication algorithm, utilizes a pipelining technique that allows concurrent operation of hardwired multipliers. Our design completes 1020-bit and 2040-bit modular multiplications in 7.62 mus and 27.0 mus, respectively. The multiplier uses a moderate amount of system resources while achieving the best area-time product in literature. 2040-bit modular exponentiation engine can easily fit into Xilinx Spartan-3E 500; moreover the exponentiation circuit withstands known side channel attacks.","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731826.pdf","startPage":"391","endPage":"396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric, Secure and Compact Implementation of RSA on FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.13","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731826","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Parametric, Secure and Compact Implementation of RSA on FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452516","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4731826/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric, Secure and Compact Implementation of RSA on FPGA","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3474a391.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066499S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731750","isNumber":"4731751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731750","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4731751","articleId":"4731826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4731827,"authors":[{"name":"Ilker Yavuz","affiliation":["The Scientific & Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)","Istanbul Technical University, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ilker","lastName":"Yavuz","id":"37085978266"},{"name":"Siddika Berna \u00d6rs Yal\u00e7in","affiliation":["Istanbul Technical University"],"firstName":"Siddika Berna \u00d6rs","lastName":"Yal\u00e7in","id":"37073312300"},{"name":"\u00c7etin Kaya Ko\u00e7","affiliation":["University of California, Santa Barbara, USA","City University of Istanbul"],"firstName":"\u00c7etin Kaya","lastName":"Ko\u00e7","id":"37326322600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3748-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"4731827","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA Implementation of an Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem over GF(3^m)","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731827.pdf","startPage":"397","endPage":"402","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.66","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.66","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Elliptic curve cryptography","Hardware","Elliptic curves","Galois fields","Arithmetic","Performance gain","Circuits","Security","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","elliptic curve cryptosystem","arithmetic processor","architectural components","systolic montgomery multiplication algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Elliptic curve cryptography","Galois field of characteristic 3","FPGA","Montgomery","systolic array"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731827","abstract":"This paper describes an efficient arithmetic processor for elliptic curve cryptography.

The enhancements are generic in the sense that they can be applied in many RISC processors beneficially. We organize these enhancements into a cryptographic unit (CU) that offers an extended ISA to the programmer. We then present the speedup values obtained for various arithmetic and public key cryptography operations through these enhancements. We also give the hardware overhead of integrating the CU to the embedded processor in terms of chip area. Our experimental results show that the proposed architectural enhancements provide significant amount of speedup values in elliptic curve cryptography and RSA with a conservative increase in hardware. We also demonstrate that the proposed enhancements facilitate protection of cryptographic algorithms against certain side-channel attacks by reporting our case study of AES implementation hardened against cache-based attacks.","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.59","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731829.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.59","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","startPage":"409","endPage":"414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhancing an Embedded Processor Core with a Cryptographic Unit for Speed and Security","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731829","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing an Embedded Processor Core with a Cryptographic Unit for Speed and Security","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731829/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452519","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4731829/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing an Embedded Processor Core with a Cryptographic Unit for Speed and Security","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3474a409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055407S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731750","isNumber":"4731751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731750","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4731751","articleId":"4731829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4731831,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Algredo-Badillo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, INAOE, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Ignacio","lastName":"Algredo-Badillo","id":"38270222200"},{"name":"Claudia Feregrino-Uribe","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, INAOE, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Feregrino-Uribe","id":"38274862700"},{"name":"Ren\u00e9 Cumplido","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, INAOE, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Ren\u00e9","lastName":"Cumplido","id":"37393936800"},{"name":"Miguel Morales-Sandoval","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, INAOE, Puebla, Mexico"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Morales-Sandoval","id":"38271729600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3748-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3474-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2325-6532"}],"articleNumber":"4731831","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":274},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Wireless networks","Open systems","Computer architecture","Hardware","Reconfigurable architectures","Software design","Software radio","Cryptography","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","radio networks","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","performance evaluation","AES-CCM cores","wireless networks","reconfigurable architectures","open system interconnection","cryptographic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA Implementation","AES-CCM","Wireless Networks"]}],"abstract":"Reconfigurable architectures are important elements on the design of software radios.

The corresponding market is now oriented towards more flexibility. As an answer we propose here a multi-algorithm cryptographic co-processor called Celator. A main processor entrusts to the Celator the cryptographic tasks like encrypting or decrypting data blocks using secret key encryption algorithms such as advanced encryption standard (AES) or data encryption standard (DES). Moreover Celator allows hashing data using the secure hash algorithms (SHA). These algorithms are frequently implemented in hi-tech secure products in software or in hardware mode. Celator corresponds to their flexible hardware implementation. Moreover an user can (under specific conditions) implement its own cryptographic algorithm in Celator. Celator can perform an AES encryption with a throughput of 47 Mbps, the DES encryption with a throughput of 26 Mbps, condense a 512 bit SHA message with a throughput of 36 Mbps. Finally we report performance comparisons among Celator, general purpose processors, and some dedicated and dynamically reconfigurable circuits.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","pdfPath":"/iel5/4731750/4731751/04731834.pdf","startPage":"438","endPage":"443","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Reconfigurable Computing and FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/ReConFig.2008.76","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ReConFig.2008.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4731751","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Celator: A Multi-algorithm Cryptographic Co-processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Coprocessors","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Throughput","Circuits","Data security","Software algorithms","Helium","Information processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips","private key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Celator","multialgorithm cryptographic co-processor","data block encryption","data block decryption","secret key encryption algorithms","advanced encryption standard","data encryption standard","secure hash algorithms","software mode","hardware mode","bit rate 47 Mbit/s","bit rate 26 Mbit/s","bit rate 36 Mbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Communication system security","Cryptography","key cryptography","Smart cards","AES","Systolic Processors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Celator: A Multi-algorithm Cryptographic Co-processor","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4731834/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452524","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Celator: A Multi-algorithm Cryptographic Co-processor","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"3474a438.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072488S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4731750","isNumber":"4731751","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4731750","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"4731751","articleId":"4731834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4731835,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

Geographic opportunistic routing (GOR) was proposed to cope with the unreliable transmissions by exploiting the broadcast nature of the wireless medium and the spatial diversity of the network topology. Previous studies on GOR have focused on networks with a single channel rate. The capability of supporting multiple channel rates, which is common in current wireless systems, has not carefully been studied for GOR. In this paper, we carry out a study on the impacts of multiple rates, as well as candidate selection, prioritization, and coordination, on the performance of GOR. We propose a new local metric, i.e., the opportunistic effective one-hop throughput (OEOT), to characterize the tradeoff between one-hop packet advancement and packet forwarding time. We further propose a local rate adaptation and candidate-selection algorithm to approach the optimum of this metric. The simulation results show that the multirate GOR (MGOR) incorporating the rate adaptation and candidate-selection algorithm achieves higher throughput and lower delay than the corresponding single-rate and multirate traditional geographic routing and single-rate opportunistic routing protocols.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2011637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062310","startPage":"3032","endPage":"3040","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5062310/04731844.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Location-Aided Opportunistic Forwarding in Multirate and Multihop Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731844/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4731844/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Location-Aided Opportunistic Forwarding in Multirate and Multihop Wireless Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10712987","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location-Aided Opportunistic Forwarding in Multirate and Multihop Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-lou-2011637.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07074S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4731844","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4731845,"authors":[{"name":"Haiping Du","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/4808359/4731845/4731845-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haiping Du received the Ph.D. degree in mechanical design and theory from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2002.","He is currently a Research Fellow in the Faculty of Engineering, University of Technology, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia.

The method provides better performance in estimating subsample shifts than two classical estimators, one using the maximum of cross-correlation function and the other seeking the zero of the complex correlation function phase. Two delay estimators using the in-phase and quadrature-phase components of signals are also compared to our estimator. Like most estimators using the complex signal phases, the estimator proposed herein presents the advantage of unaltered accuracy when low sampled signals are used. Moreover, we show that this method can be applied to motion tracking with ultrasound images. Thus, included in a block-based motion estimation method and tested with ultrasound data, this estimator provides an analytical solution to the translation estimation problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4731853/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10390979","pubMedId":"19126471","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analytic Estimation of Subsample Spatial Shift Using the Phases of Multidimensional Analytic Signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic Estimation of Subsample Spatial Shift Using the Phases of Multidimensional Analytic Signals","sourcePdf":"18tip02-abasarab-2009412.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062549S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4747382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4747382","articleId":"4731853","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4731854,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Baruffa","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering (DIEI), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4747382/4731854/4731854-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Giuseppe Baruffa was born in Perugia, Italy, in 1970.

At the receiver side, there is distortion due to the compression performed at the sender side, and to the errors introduced in the data stream by the channel. Progressive source coding can also be successfully exploited to protect different portions of the data stream with different channel code rates, based upon the relative importance that each portion has on the reconstructed image. Unequal error protection (UEP) schemes are generally adopted, which offer a close to the optimal solution. In this paper, we present a dichotomic technique for searching the optimal UEP strategy, which lends ideas from existing algorithms, for the transmission of JPEG 2000 images and video over a wireless channel. Moreover, we also adopt a method of virtual interleaving to be used for the transmission of high bit rate streams over packet loss channels, guaranteeing a large PSNR advantage over a plain transmission scheme. These two protection strategies can also be combined to maximize the error correction capabilities.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2008421","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4747382/04731854.pdf","startPage":"346","endPage":"356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2008421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4747382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Protection and Interleaving for Wireless Transmission of JPEG 2000 Images and Video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4731854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4731854/","displayDocTitle":"Error Protection and Interleaving for Wireless Transmission of JPEG 2000 Images and Video","volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10390980","pubMedId":"19126472","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4731854/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Protection and Interleaving for Wireless Transmission of JPEG 2000 Images and Video","sourcePdf":"18tip01-gbaruffa-2008421.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100595S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4747382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4747382","articleId":"4731854","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4731880,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Dong","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Inst. of Inf.

In this paper, we consider transmitters that reduce the PAPR by slightly disturbing the symbols in carriers used to transmit information and by sending dummy symbols-i.e., symbols not conveying information-in unused carriers. The optimal choice of the data and dummy symbols is determined by the solution of a convex optimization problem. To reduce the PAPR with low complexity, we apply a modified version of the adaptive projected subgradient method to a sequence of convex cost functions closely related to the original optimization problem. The resulting algorithm achieves near-optimal PAPR in practical scenarios, generalizes existing algorithms based on Polyak's method, and can easily handle multiple constraints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible Peak-To-Average Power Ratio Reduction Scheme for OFDM Systems by the Adaptive Projected Subgradient Method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2011821","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4799349/04732311.pdf","startPage":"1456","endPage":"1468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2011821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799349","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible Peak-To-Average Power Ratio Reduction Scheme for OFDM Systems by the Adaptive Projected Subgradient Method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10544153","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible Peak-To-Average Power Ratio Reduction Scheme for OFDM Systems by the Adaptive Projected Subgradient Method","sourcePdf":"57tsp04-rcavalcante-2011821.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032317S","chronDate":"April  2009","isNumber":"4799349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4732311","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4732313,"authors":[{"name":"Jussi Salmi","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Helsinki University of Technology, Espoo, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4799349/4732313/4732313-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jussi Salmi (S'05) was born in Finland in 1981.

The observation model utilizes the dense multipath component (DMC), describing the distributed scattering in the channel, as part of the underlying noise process.

The design criterion is the average mean-square error (MSE) of the least square (LS) estimates of the channel frequency response over the data carriers. To maximize bandwidth efficiency, the number of pilots is set to its minimum which is equal to the number of unknown channel coefficients. Both the phase shift orthogonal and disjoint pilot schemes are investigated. For a given pilot placement, a closed-form expression for the pilot power distribution for the disjoint scheme is provided. It is found that the optimal power distribution allocates less power to the pilots that are close to the virtual carriers. Pilot placement is obtained using an exhaustive search. The latter is too complex in systems with large number of subcarriers. A suboptimum pilot placement design for the disjoint pilot scheme is presented. It is shown that, unlike fully loaded systems where the two pilot design schemes have similar performance, in the presence of virtual carriers the optimal disjoint scheme not only has lower complexity but also yields more accurate channel estimation and bit error rate performance.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2011824","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4814882/04732314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2011824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4814882","startPage":"2024","endPage":"2029","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Design for MIMO OFDM Systems With Virtual Carriers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Design for MIMO OFDM Systems With Virtual Carriers","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732314/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10572981","dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4732314/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Design for MIMO OFDM Systems With Virtual Carriers","sourcePdf":"57tsp04-mghogho-2011824.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103515S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4814882","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4814882","articleId":"4732314","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4732315,"authors":[{"name":"Tirza Routtenberg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beersheba, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4814882/4732315/4732315-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tirza Routtenberg received the B.Sc. degree (magna cum laude) in biomedical engineering from the Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, in 2005 and the M.Sc. degree (magna cum laude) in electrical engineering from the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel, in 2007.

Both algorithms are based on the generalized expectation-maximization (GEM) method for joint estimation of the MIMO-AR model parameters and the GMM parameters of the sources. The first algorithm is derived under the assumption of unstructured input signal statistics, while the second algorithm incorporates the prior knowledge about the structure of the input signal statistics due to the statistically independent source assumption.

The system identification performances are tested by comparison between the state transition matrix estimation using the proposed algorithms and the well-known multidimensional Yule-Walker solution followed by an instantaneous BSS method. The results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the Yule-Walker based approach. The BSS performances were compared to other convolutive BSS methods.

In the case of a maximum number of iterations as it is likely in real-time systems, our modification clearly outperforms the original LLL algorithm as far as the quality of the reduced lattice basis is concerned.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2011827","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4799349/04732316.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2011827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799349","startPage":"1634","endPage":"1637","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fixed Complexity LLL Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fixed Complexity LLL Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732316/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10517083","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4732316/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fixed Complexity LLL Algorithm","sourcePdf":"57tsp04-hvetter-2011827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059795S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4799349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4799349","articleId":"4732316","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4732317,"authors":[{"name":"Angela Sara Cacciapuoti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Biomedica, Elettronica e delle Telecomunicazioni (DIBET), Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, Napoli, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4799349/4732317/4732317-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Angela Sara Cacciapuoti was born in Pozzuoli, Italy, on August 19, 1980.

This paper addresses the joint timing and channel estimation problem, and furthermore the resynchronization of multiple timing offsets in a cooperative relay system. The estimations of timing and channel are conducted in two phases and the associated Cramer-Rao bounds (CRB) are derived for both phases. It is demonstrated that the conventional CRB is not valid for timing parameters under fading conditions, and a new bound called weighted Bayesian CRB is proposed. With the timing and channel estimates, a general framework of the resynchronization filter design is developed in order to compensate the multiple timing offsets at the destination. The proposed methods are applied to different scenarios with varying degrees of timing misalignment and are numerically shown to provide excellent performances that approach the perfectly synchronized case.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.2011834","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4799349/04732319.pdf","startPage":"1444","endPage":"1455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.2011834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing Synchronization in Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732319","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"31 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732319/","displayDocTitle":"Timing Synchronization in Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Communication Systems","volume":"57","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10517088","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4732319/","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing Synchronization in Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"57tsp04-xli-2011834.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105366S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4799349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4799349","articleId":"4732319","onlineDate":"31 December 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4732321,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The code symbol error estimates are based on the mean-squared error (MSE) criterion and are first used to detect the presence of large numerical errors. Then the correction of symbols uses these Kalman estimators directly. The wavelet code symbols are corrupted by low levels of processing noise continuously and occasionally by large disruptive errors, e.g., impulsive noise. The modeling variables have time-varying statistics allowing both types of errors to be handled naturally. Kalman time-varying tracking filters, which use wavelet syndromes as their measurement inputs, develop the fixed-lag smoothed estimates for the larger errors. The syndromes are also modeled as corrupted by processing noise modeling computational failure errors, large and small. Hypothesis detection methods are used to locate large errors and their statistics must include Kalman mismatch characteristics to be valid. Estimators from several adjacent lag positions assist in the detection procedures. Simulation results show correction accuracy in the time domain as well as on a MSE basis. Large classes of wavelet codes are designed using binary convolutional codes as starting points from which the proper filter weights for encoding and syndrome evaluating are determined.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4799349/04732321.pdf","startPage":"1339","endPage":"1350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

It shows that the former is close to the later, the maximum prediction error is lower than 10%, which indicates that it is feasible toapply BP neural network to predict anode accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ISISE.2008.55","pdfPath":"/iel5/4732148/4732321/04732427.pdf","startPage":"428","endPage":"432","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Science and Engineering","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISISE.2008.55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of BP Neural Network for Predicting Anode Accuracy in ECM","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of BP Neural Network for Predicting Anode Accuracy in ECM","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10453041","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4732427/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of BP Neural Network for Predicting Anode Accuracy in ECM","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3494b428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046577S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4732148","isNumber":"4732321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4732148","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4732321","articleId":"4732427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4732442,"authors":[{"name":"Weigang Jiang","affiliation":["Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base of Zhuhai College, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Weigang","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37399917100"},{"name":"Yuanbiao Zhang","affiliation":["Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base of Zhuhai College, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Yuanbiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405800600"},{"name":"Jianwen Xie","affiliation":["Mathematical Modeling Innovative Practice Base of Zhuhai College, Jinan University, Zhuhai, China"],"firstName":"Jianwen","lastName":"Xie","id":"37405095100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3494-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1283"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1291"}],"articleNumber":"4732442","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732442","abstract":"Inspired by the diffusion movement phenomenon of the molecules, this paper presents a diffusion-repulsion particle swarm optimization (DRPSO).

Comparing to other GAs, CGA doesn\u2019t intervene three classical operations of GA (i.e. selection, crossover and mutation), it does competition according to the concentration when a new individual is born, and evolves a more diversiform and fitter generation.

Only qualified subsets of participants can recover the secret image. The yet known schemes omitted the deference between primary information and secondary one in secret image, and its best known upper bound on the share size is exponential. Besides its information communication rate is high. This paper proposes a new VCS for general access structures using pi-sigma neural networks (VCSPSN). A pi-sigma neural network (PSN) is a class of two-layer feedforward net-work. Compared to other high-order networks, a PSN has a highly regular structure, needs a much smaller number of weights and less training time. Using PSN's capability of large-scale parallel classification, VCSPSN reduces the information communication rate greatly, makes best known upper bound polynomial, and distinguishes the deferent information in secret image. This paper firstly introduces the structure of PSN, and then constructs the VCSPSN and analysis its security and capability.","doi":"10.1109/ISISE.2008.208","startPage":"679","endPage":"682","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4732148/4732321/04732483.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Science and Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISISE.2008.208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual Cryptography Scheme Using Pi-sigma Neural Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cryptography","Neural networks","Upper bound","Feedforward neural networks","Computer science","Polynomials","Information science","Mathematics","Large-scale systems","Information security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","feedforward neural nets","image coding","neural nets","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual cryptography scheme","pi-sigma neural networks","secret image","image coding","information communication rate","two-layer feedforward net-work","high-order networks","large-scale parallel classification","upper bound polynomial"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Visual Cryptography Scheme Using Pi-sigma Neural Networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4732483/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10453094","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual Cryptography Scheme Using Pi-sigma Neural Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3494b679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.1083S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4732148","isNumber":"4732321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4732148","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4732321","articleId":"4732483","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4732484,"authors":[{"name":"Yidan Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Yidan","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37654504200"},{"name":"Ping Ma","affiliation":["Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Ma","id":"37659737700"},{"name":"Jie Lan","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Lan","id":"37587358900"},{"name":"Chun Liang","affiliation":["Department of Botany, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Liang","id":"37652993200"},{"name":"Guoli Ji","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"firstName":"Guoli","lastName":"Ji","id":"37410764500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3494-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-1283"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1291"}],"articleNumber":"4732484","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Sequences","Bioinformatics","Heuristic algorithms","Dynamic programming","Information science","Automation","Cloning","Chemicals","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","DNA"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved ant colony algorithm","DNA sequence alignment","bioinformatics","local optimum","improved sequence alignment method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNA sequence","alignment","ant colony algorithm","pheromone","score"]}],"abstract":"DNA sequence alignment forms an important basis for bioinformatics. Developing accurate sequence alignment algorithms remains to be a very challenging computational problem. When applied to sequence alignment, the traditional ant colony algorithm is limited to aligning sequences of similar length and may cause a local optimum. An improved sequence alignment method based on the ant colony algorithm was brought forward in this paper. The new method could avoid a local optimum and remove especially the paths' scores of great difference by regulating the initial and final positions of ants and by modifying pheromones in different times. Consequently, our method has the ability of aligning sequences with very different lengths and avoiding the local optimum caused by the traditional algorithm. The sequence alignment results suggest that our improved ant colony algorithm is efficient and feasible in DNA sequence alignment.","doi":"10.1109/ISISE.2008.82","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Information Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4732148/4732321/04732484.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISISE.2008.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732321","startPage":"683","endPage":"688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved Ant Colony Algorithm for DNA Sequence Alignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732484","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Improved Ant Colony Algorithm for DNA Sequence Alignment","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732484/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10453095","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4732484/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved Ant Colony Algorithm for DNA Sequence Alignment","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3494b683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048081S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4732148","isNumber":"4732321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4732148","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4732321","articleId":"4732484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4732522,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37089092843"},{"name":"Guozhen Tan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Guozhen","lastName":"Tan","id":"37531473000"},{"name":"Nan Ding","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Ding","id":"37588036000"},{"name":"Yao Shang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Shang","id":"37655892900"},{"name":"Mingwen Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Mingwen","lastName":"Lin","id":"37654976300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2111-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2112-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"4732522","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":223},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732522","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Magnetic sensors","Neural networks","Vehicle detection","Intelligent transportation systems","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Computer science","Intelligent sensors","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","magnetic sensors","neural nets","traffic engineering computing","vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle classification algorithm","binary proximity magnetic sensors","back propagation neural networks","high sensitive magnetic sensors","magnetic field distortion"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732522","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721641/4732517/04732522.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","startPage":"145","endPage":"150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle Classification Algorithm based on Binary Proximity Magnetic Sensors and Neural Network","abstract":"To improve the classification accuracy, a new algorithm is developed with binary proximity magnetic sensors and back propagation neural networks.

In this view the use of real-time floating-car data (FCD), based on traces of GPS positions, is emerging as a reliable and cost-effective way to gather accurate travel times/speeds in a road network and to improve short-term predictions of travel conditions. The purpose of this paper is to present a large-scale working application of FCD-system, developed and operated by OCTOTelematics, delivering real-time traffic speed information throughout the Italian motorway network and along some important arterial streets located in major Italian metropolitan areas. Traffic speed estimates are deduced at an interval of 3 minutes from GPS traces transmitted in real-time from a large number (and still growing) of privately owned cars (about 600.000) equipped with a specific device covering a range of insurance-related applications. This paper also proposes two algorithms, respectively based on artificial neural networks and pattern-matching, designed to on-line perform short-term (15 to 30 minutes) predictions of link travel speeds by using current and near-past link average speeds estimated by the OCTOTelematics FCD system. The Rome ring road (GRA-Grande Raccordo Anulare) was used for testing the feasibility of the two algorithms. Testing results showed that the proposed approaches for short-term predictions are very promising and effective.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732517","startPage":"197","endPage":"203","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721641/4732517/04732534.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic Estimation And Prediction Based On Real Time Floating Car Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732534/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4732534/","displayDocTitle":"Traffic Estimation And Prediction Based On Real Time Floating Car Data","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452262","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic Estimation And Prediction Based On Real Time Floating Car Data","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ITSC-00-17.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044285S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721641","isNumber":"4732517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721641","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"4732517","articleId":"4732534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4732564,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Veit","affiliation":["LIVIC (INRETS-LCPC), Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Veit","id":"37282937800"},{"name":"Jean-Philippe Tarel","affiliation":["LCPC, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Philippe","lastName":"Tarel","id":"37326337400"},{"name":"Philippe Nicolle","affiliation":["LCPC Nantes, Bouguenais, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Nicolle","id":"37660071100"},{"name":"Pierre Charbonnier","affiliation":["LRPC Strasbourg (ERA 27 LCPC), Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Charbonnier","id":"37341262000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2111-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2112-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"4732564","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":119,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1568},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732564","abstract":"This paper proposes a systematic approach to evaluate algorithms for extracting road marking features from images. This specific topic is seldom addressed in the literature while many road marking detection algorithms have been proposed. Most of them can be decomposed into three steps: extracting road marking features, estimating a geometrical marking model, tracking the parameters of the geometrical model along an image sequence. The present work focuses on the first step, i.e. feature extraction. A reference database containing over 100 images of natural road scenes was built with corresponding manually labeled ground truth images (available at http://www.lcpc.fr/en/produits/ride/). This database enables to evaluate and compare extractors in a systematic way. Different road marking feature extraction algorithm representing different classes of techniques are evaluated: thresholding, gradient analysis, and convolution. As a result of this analysis, recommendations are given on which extractor to choose according to a specific application.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732564","startPage":"174","endPage":"181","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721641/4732517/04732564.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Road Marking Feature Extraction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Roads","Solid modeling","Image databases","Spatial databases","Detection algorithms","Image sequences","Layout","Algorithm design and analysis","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","feature extraction","geometry","gradient methods","image sequences","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road marking feature extraction","road marking detection","geometrical marking model","image sequence","gradient analysis","convolution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Road Marking Feature Extraction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4732564/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452292","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Road Marking Feature Extraction","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ITSC-00-47.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061702S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721641","isNumber":"4732517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721641","citationCount":"119","xplore-issue":"4732517","articleId":"4732564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":4732566,"authors":[{"name":"Nabil Benmansour","affiliation":["INRETS/LCPC-LIVIC Laboratoire sur les Interactions V\u00e9hicule-Infrastructure-Conducteur, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Nabil","lastName":"Benmansour","id":"37660080600"},{"name":"Raphael Labayrade","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lyon, Lyon, France","CNRS, URA 1652, D\u00e9partement G\u00e9nie Civil et B\u00e2timent, Ecole Nationale des Travaux Publics de l'Etat, Vaulx-en-Velin, France"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Labayrade","id":"37296053900"},{"name":"Didier Aubert","affiliation":["INRETS/LCPC-LIVIC Laboratoire sur les Interactions V\u00e9hicule-Infrastructure-Conducteur, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Aubert","id":"37296055000"},{"name":"Sebastien Glaser","affiliation":["INRETS/LCPC-LIVIC Laboratoire sur les Interactions V\u00e9hicule-Infrastructure-Conducteur, Versailles, France"],"firstName":"Sebastien","lastName":"Glaser","id":"37324054800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2111-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2112-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"4732566","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732566","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Roads","Intelligent transportation systems","Geometry","Feature extraction","Computer vision","Robustness","Image recognition","Iterative algorithms","Parameter estimation","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated highways","computational geometry","computer vision","estimation theory","feature extraction","image matching","iterative methods","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistical analysis","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stereovision-based 3D road lane detection system","3D geometry estimation","model driven approach","recognition algorithm","statistical model","training stage","iterative method","image feature extraction","image matching"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["road lane detection","stereovision","statistical model","model driven matching"]}],"abstract":"A new stereovision-based method for the road lane detection and 3D geometry estimation is presented in this paper. The proposed approach is based on a recognition algorithm driven by a statistical model of the 3D road lane, projected in both stereoscopic images. First, the model is initialized thanks to a training stage. The model is then updated iteratively, from successively extracted image features. After each iteration, the detection of the next features, in any of the two images of the stereoscopic pair, is driven by the features already detected. The parameters of the road lane, such as width, horizontal and vertical curvature, roll, pitch, and yaw angles, are estimated. The variance of each parameter is also estimated, and is minimized through the estimation process. Unlike previous proposed approaches, no disparity map is required : the matching of the image features is directly obtained as a result of the model update. Thus, computing time is low. Experiments from computer-generated and real images are carried out to assess the efficiency and accuracy of the method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732566","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721641/4732517/04732566.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"188","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stereovision-based 3D lane detection system: a model driven approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Stereovision-based 3D lane detection system: a model driven approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4732566/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452294","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732566/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stereovision-based 3D lane detection system: a model driven approach","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ITSC-00-49.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073732S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721641","isNumber":"4732517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721641","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4732517","articleId":"4732566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4732583,"authors":[{"name":"Jorn Marten Wille","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Jorn Marten","lastName":"Wille","id":"37543550600"},{"name":"Thomas Form","affiliation":["Institute of Control Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4at Braunschweig, Brunswick, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Form","id":"37660044500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2111-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2112-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"4732583","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":302},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732583","abstract":"Autonomous transportation on public roads has been demonstrated on German Highways since the early nineties.

Among 11 teams from the initial 89, team CarOLO mastered the challenges to qualify for the final DARPA Urban Challenge event. This paper describes the overall concept implemented in the field of autonomous vehicle guidance of team CarOLO for the DARPA Urban Challenge 2007.

Accidents often arise from misbehavior of one or several drivers when inducing a driving manoeuvre. Dangers can occur either when the intented manoeuvre is not well adjusted to the current traffic situation, or when the manoeuvre is not properly announced to the environment so that the intention is misinterpreted. When designing advanced driver assistance systems, it is beneficial to gather information about driver behaviors as accurately and early as possible. This work investigates early driver intention inference with hidden Markov models by observing easily accessible vehicle and environment signals such as pedal positions or global vehicle position on a digital map in real traffic.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732630","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721641/4732517/04732630.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732630","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Driver Intention Recognition with Hidden Markov Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732630","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732630/","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Driver Intention Recognition with Hidden Markov Models","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452358","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4732630/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Driver Intention Recognition with Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ITSC-00-113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058109S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721641","isNumber":"4732517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721641","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4732517","articleId":"4732630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":4732647,"authors":[{"name":"Xuerui Bai","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuerui","lastName":"Bai","id":"37629628000"},{"name":"Dongbin Zhao","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China","China Scholarship Council, University of Arizona Tucson, USA"],"firstName":"Dongbin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277016800"},{"name":"Jianqiang Yi","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianqiang","lastName":"Yi","id":"37277001200"},{"name":"Jing Xu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Complex Systems and Intelligence Science, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Xu","id":"37065788600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2111-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2112-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"4732647","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Traffic control","Dynamic programming","Control systems","Communication system traffic control","Intelligent transportation systems","Optimal control","Acceleration","Feedback control","Laboratories","Intelligent systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","heuristic programming","metering","road traffic","transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinated control","DHP controller","action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming","eligibility traces","local ramp metering control","multiple ramp metering control","dual heuristic programming","coordinate ramp metering control","approximate optimal ramp metering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732647","abstract":"we presented a novel control method in previous studies, which is action-dependent heuristic dynamic programming based on eligibility traces (ADHDP (lambda)).

The new method DHP (lambda) is composed of DHP and eligibility traces. DHP has efficiently solved the problem of coordinate ramp metering control, and eligibility traces can accelerate the learning rate of DHP. DHP (lambda) is an approximate optimal ramp metering method.

The main idea is to use such network to perform both feature extraction and classification. This simplicity enables real time applications. In order to achieve such capabilities, the network is trained by a new algorithm, proposed in this paper, named minimization of inter-class interference (MCI). Such algorithm aims to create a hidden space (i.e. feature space) where the patterns have a desirable statistical distribution. Regarding the neural architecture, the linear output layer is replaced by the Mahalanobis kernel, in order to improve generalization. Experiments are performed by means of a dataset that includes two standard datasets from Caltech car rear. Finally, disturbed images are used, in order to evaluate the robustness of the neural-network based vehicle detection. The proposed method reveals low miss rate, low false alarm rate and high area under ROC curve. In Matlab environment, the algorithm spends only 3.280e-4 seconds per image. These facts encourage this research line.","doi":"10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732681","publicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721641/4732517/04732681.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ITSC.2008.4732681","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Generalization Properties of Neural Networks: an Application to Vehicle Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732681/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Generalization Properties of Neural Networks: an Application to Vehicle Detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10452409","htmlLink":"/document/4732681/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Generalization Properties of Neural Networks: an Application to Vehicle Detection","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ITSC-00-164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077198S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721641","isNumber":"4732517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721641","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4732517","articleId":"4732681","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4732708,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijit Kallapur","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Abhijit","lastName":"Kallapur","id":"37571099700"},{"name":"Mahendra Samal","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Mahendra","lastName":"Samal","id":"37644543100"},{"name":"Vishwas Puttige","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Vishwas","lastName":"Puttige","id":"37644542700"},{"name":"Sreenatha Anavatti","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Sreenatha","lastName":"Anavatti","id":"37563207000"},{"name":"Matthew Garratt","affiliation":["School of AeroSpace, Civil and Mechanical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Canberra, ACT, Australia"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Garratt","id":"37299691600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2111-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2112-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-0009"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0017"}],"articleNumber":"4732708","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System identification","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Neural networks","Sensor systems","State estimation","Control systems","Measurement units","Global Positioning System","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace robotics","attitude control","error compensation","inertial systems","Kalman filters","MIMO systems","mobile robots","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","remotely operated vehicles","state estimation","telerobotics","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UKF-NN framework","system identification","small unmanned aerial vehicles","unscented Kalman filter estimator","neural network identifier","state estimator","error-compensated attitude","error-compensated velocities","inertial measurement unit","global positioning system","rotary-wing 6- DOF multi-input-multi-output nonlinear UAV models"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732708","abstract":"This paper presents a novel system identification framework for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) by combining an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) estimator with a neural network (NN) identifier.

The APSO algorithm uses the information of the population diversity to adjust nonlinearly inertia weight. Velocity mutation factor and position interchange factor are both introduced and the global performance is clearly improved. The APSO algorithm is applied to optimization of parameters in the optimal model based on support vector machine (SVM). SVM is a popular classification method with many diverse applications. A novel Adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) based approach for parameter determination and feature selection of the SVM, termed APSO+SVM is developed. The illustrating example shows that the classification accuracy of APSO+SVM is higher than other traditional methods of classification, so using APSO+SVM method to classify is feasible and effective.","doi":"10.1109/KAM.2008.154","startPage":"703","endPage":"707","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KAM.2008.154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732767","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling","pdfPath":"/iel5/4732766/4732767/04732919.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Classification Approach Based on Support Vector Machine and Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732919/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Novel Classification Approach Based on Support Vector Machine and Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4732919/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10453545","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Classification Approach Based on Support Vector Machine and Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3488a703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042307S","chronDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4732766","isNumber":"4732767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4732766","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4732767","articleId":"4732919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4732952,"authors":[{"name":"Agung Fatwanto","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Australian National University, Australia"],"firstName":"Agung","lastName":"Fatwanto","id":"37660103900"},{"name":"Clive Boughton","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Australian National University, Australia"],"firstName":"Clive","lastName":"Boughton","id":"37660104300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3488-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4732952","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4732952","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Computer science","Programming","Context modeling","Knowledge acquisition","Performance analysis","Documentation","Software systems","Contracts","Natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","Unified Modeling Language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["functional requirements","translative model-driven development","conceptual models","software development","concern-oriented model-driven development","formal specification","UML","modeling notation","COMDD framework","voter tracking system","handheld electronic devices"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Analysis and Design","Model-Driven Development","Translative","Requirements Specification"]}],"abstract":"Conceptual models play an important role within model-driven development (MDD) and become the main artifacts of software development. Developing conceptual model, however, is not a trivial task. There is no clear, direct way to transform requirements into conceptual models. Few methods have been offered aiding developers to develop conceptual models. Yet, those methods do not fully address the specific need for software development using a translative approach of MDD such as concern-oriented model-driven development (COMDD) where the conceptual model for each concern must be separated. This paper proposes a method to analyze, specify, and develop conceptual models of functional requirements (FRs) especially in the context of translative model-driven development. Our method employs a uses-case approach for FRs analysis accompanied with scenario-based approach for the specification. Executable and translatable UML is used as the modeling notation due to the translative nature of COMDD framework. We show the viability of our method using a real-life case study: voter tracking system, a system to mark voters using handheld electronic devices.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4732767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/KAM.2008.185","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on Knowledge Acquisition and Modeling","pdfPath":"/iel5/4732766/4732767/04732952.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"863","doi":"10.1109/KAM.2008.185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis, Specification and Modeling of Functional Requirements for Translative Model-Driven Development","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Analysis, Specification and Modeling of Functional Requirements for Translative Model-Driven Development","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4732952/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10453578","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4732952/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis, Specification and Modeling of Functional Requirements for Translative Model-Driven Development","confLoc":"Wuhan, China","sourcePdf":"3488a859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049869S","chronDate":"21-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4732766","isNumber":"4732767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4732766","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4732767","articleId":"4732952","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4733955,"authors":[{"name":"Haibin Cheng","affiliation":["Michigan State University, Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Haibin","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37634563500"},{"name":"Pang-Ning Tan","affiliation":["Michigan State University, Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Pang-Ning","lastName":"Tan","id":"37531392600"},{"name":"Christopher Potter","affiliation":["NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Potter","id":"37403631100"},{"name":"Steven Klooster","affiliation":["California State University, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Klooster","id":"37589729700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3503-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-9232"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"4733955","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":499},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Kernel","Ecosystems","Vegetation","Data mining","Geoscience","Telecommunication traffic","Detection algorithms","Earth","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","graph theory","matrix algebra","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust graph-based algorithm","noisy multivariate time series anomaly detection","data mining","kernel matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multivariate time series","anomaly detection","Characterization"]}],"abstract":"Detection of anomalies in multivariate time series is an important data mining task with potential applications in medical diagnosis, ecosystem modeling, and network traffic monitoring.

The BIA represents a highly distributed analytical engine that supports OLAP and data mining processing primitives. The system organizes data entities in column-wise fashion and its operation is completely main-memory-based. Since case studies have shown that classic data mining queries spend a large portion of their runtime on scanning and filtering the data as a necessary prerequisite to the actual mining step, our main goal was to speed up this expensive scanning and filtering process. In a first step, the paper outlines the basic data mining processing techniques within SAP NetWeaver BIA and illustrates the implementation of scans and filters. In a second step, we give insight into the main features of a hybrid system architecture design exploiting graphic card processor technology.

They are capable of storing large volumes of data and often have multiple compute nodes. However, the inherent heterogeneity of data components, the dynamic nature of distributed systems, the need for information synchronization and data fusion over a network and security and access control issues makes the problem of resource management and monitoring a tremendous challenge. In particular, centralized algorithms for management of resources and data may not be sufficient to manage complex distributed systems. In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm for resource and data management which builds on the traditional simplex algorithm used for solving linear optimization problems. Our distributed algorithm is an exact one meaning its results are identical if run in a centralized setting. We provide extensive analytical results and experiments on simulated data to demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Linear Programming and Resource Management for Data Mining in Distributed Environments","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2008.137","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733896/4733897/04733978.pdf","startPage":"543","endPage":"552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2008.137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4733897","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4733978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4733978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Linear Programming and Resource Management for Data Mining in Distributed Environments","conferenceDate":"15-19 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4733978/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10453344","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Linear Programming and Resource Management for Data Mining in Distributed Environments","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3503a543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074135S","chronDate":"15-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733896","isNumber":"4733897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733896","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4733897","articleId":"4733978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4733994,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Davy","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Group, Department of Computer Science, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Davy","id":"37665069900"},{"name":"Saturnino Luz","affiliation":["Artificial Intelligence Group, Department of Computer Science, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland"],"firstName":"Saturnino","lastName":"Luz","id":"37418483100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3503-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2375-9232"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-9259"}],"articleNumber":"4733994","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4733994","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Learning","Computer errors","Switches","Text categorization","Data mining","Conferences","Artificial intelligence","Computer science","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","filtering theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","query processing","set theory","signal sampling","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive prefiltering technique","error-reduction sampling","active learning","query selection strategy","subset optimisation","empirical evaluations","benchmark text categorisation datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active Learning","Text Categorisation","Error Reduction Sampling"]}],"abstract":"Error-reduction sampling (ERS) is a high performing (but computationally expensive) query selection strategy for active learning. Subset optimisation has been proposed to reduce computational expense by applying ERS to only a subset of examples from the pool. This paper compares techniques used to construct the subset, namely random sub-sampling and pre-filtering. We focus on pre-filtering which populates the subset with more informative examples by filtering from the unlabelled pool using a query selection strategy. In this paper we establish whether pre-filtering outperforms sub-sampling optimisation, examine the effect of subset size, and propose a novel adaptive pre-filtering technique which dynamically switches between several alternative pre-filtering techniques using a multi-armed bandit algorithm. Empirical evaluations conducted on two benchmark text categorisation datasets demonstrate that pre-filtered ERS achieve higher levels of accuracy when compared to sub-sampled ERS. The proposed adaptive pre-filtering technique is also shown to be competitive with the optimal pre-filtering technique on the majority of problems and is never the worst technique.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4733897","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDMW.2008.52","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel5/4733896/4733897/04733994.pdf","startPage":"682","endPage":"691","doi":"10.1109/ICDMW.2008.52","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Adaptive Pre-filtering Technique for Error-Reduction Sampling in Active Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An Adaptive Pre-filtering Technique for Error-Reduction Sampling in Active Learning","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4733994/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10453360","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4733994/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Adaptive Pre-filtering Technique for Error-Reduction Sampling in Active Learning","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"3503a682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059835S","chronDate":"15-19 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4733896","isNumber":"4733897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4733896","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4733897","articleId":"4733994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4734126,"authors":[{"name":"B.K.

The large variations in the input signal are removed/smoothened by a suitable pre-processing method, one of which is using an integrator which can smoothen the rapid changes. The SONG and modified ABATE algorithm is used for the adaptation of step size. With signal-to-quantization error ratio (SNR) as a performance measure, the proposed ADM with preprocessed signals shows a better improvement in its performance as compared to the conventional ADM. The proposed ADM also leads to a high dynamic range performance and shows a reduction in the noise power as compared to the conventional ADM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10439049","htmlLink":"/document/4734126/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Digital Coding of Speech Waveforms Using the Proposed ADM","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Coding of Speech Waveforms Using the Proposed ADM","confLoc":"Hainan, China","sourcePdf":"3431a381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055847S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4734038","isNumber":"4734039","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4734038","xplore-issue":"4734039","articleId":"4734126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4734130,"authors":[{"name":"ZeGuang Jin","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Mokwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"ZeGuang","lastName":"Jin","id":"37655171300"},{"name":"HeauJo Kang","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Mokwon University, South Korea"],"firstName":"HeauJo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37655006500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3431-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4734130","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":17},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Radiofrequency interference","Fading","Radio transmitters","Communication systems","AWGN","Frequency diversity","Pulse shaping methods","Filters","Context modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cochannel interference","code division multiple access","error statistics","Nakagami channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCI canceller technique","Nakagami-m fading","fractionally spreading MC-CDMA","bit error probability","symbol fraction level","chip level","AWGN channel","fast fading channel","multicarrier code division multiple access","cochannel interference"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we evaluate the performance of fractionally spreading (FS) MC-CDMA, which the data streams are spread at both the symbol fraction level and at the chip level by the transmitter and hence the proposed scheme is referred to as the fractionally spread MC-CDMA arrangement or FS MC-CDMA, interms of average bit error probability (BEP), which is charactorized by AWGN and Nakagami-m Fading. The results are applicable to FS MC-CDMA systems employing with CCI. As a results, the probability of BEP in fast fading is always higher than that in slow fading, and the difference of BEP between the fast fading and slow fading diminishes with m approaching infinity.

Our experiments show that our method can be applicable to a real environment with strong confidence.","doi":"10.1109/FGCN.2008.165","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication and Networking","startPage":"302","endPage":"305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCN.2008.165","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4734155","pdfPath":"/iel5/4734038/4734155/04734227.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication and Networking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wearable sensors","Accelerometers","Radiofrequency identification","Wireless sensor networks","Classification tree analysis","Humans","Decision trees","Object detection","Motion detection","RFID tags"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","biomechanics","biomedical equipment","Bluetooth","decision trees","geriatrics","health care","image motion analysis","medical image processing","mobile handsets","object recognition","radiofrequency identification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["activity recognition","wearable sensors","elder care","accelerometers","RFID sensor","wireless accelerometers","human body states","decision tree","RFID tagged objects","hand movement","object detection","object related hand motion information","Bluetooth","wireless triaxial accelerometers","iGrabber","glove type RFID reader","mobile phone environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Activity","Accelerometer","RFID","Elder"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Activity Recognition Using Wearable Sensors for Elder Care","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734227/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4734227/","accessionNumber":"10439140","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Activity Recognition Using Wearable Sensors for Elder Care","confLoc":"Hainan, China","sourcePdf":"3431b302.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064951S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4734038","isNumber":"4734155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4734038","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4734155","articleId":"4734227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4734251,"authors":[{"name":"John Herbert","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Herbert","id":"37300080200"},{"name":"John O'Donoghue","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"O'Donoghue","id":"37298811200"},{"name":"Xiang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College Cork, Ireland"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37654865400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3431-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4734251","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Smart buildings","Context-aware services","Engines","Intelligent sensors","Environmental management","Context","Computer architecture","Wireless sensor networks","Temperature sensors","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","knowledge based systems","software architecture","XML"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["context-sensitive rule-based architecture","smart building environment","data management system-context architecture","XML specifications","context information","wireless sensor network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["smart home","context-sensitive","rule-based","building monitoring","wireless sensor network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4734251","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication and Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/4734038/4734155/04734251.pdf","startPage":"437","endPage":"440","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FGCN.2008.169","doi":"10.1109/FGCN.2008.169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4734155","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Conference on Future Generation Communication and Networking","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Context-Sensitive Rule-Based Architecture for a Smart Building Environment","abstract":"In a smart building environment nomadic users can benefit from specialised context-sensitive services. These can increase productivity and offer an improved lifestyle for users. The data management system-context architecture (DMS-CA) has been designed to provide these services. The DMS-CA is novel in providing a completely generic system that is both user-friendly and efficient. The system is generic in that it can be tailored by the system administrator (using XML specifications) for a particular environment of context information inputs and a set of services. In addition, the actual rules that determine which services are triggered by which combination of contextual inputs are determined by the individual user in a user-friendly manner. Thus the generic architecture can be easily deployed for a particular building and an individual user. Generic solutions are sometimes inefficient but this system has been designed to be highly efficient through using an event-based architecture and dealing with time in a special way. The DMS-CA has been deployed for a building incorporating a wireless sensor network, and shown to provide a high quality, efficient context-sensitive data delivery service.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734251/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10439164","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4734251/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A Context-Sensitive Rule-Based Architecture for a Smart Building Environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Context-Sensitive Rule-Based Architecture for a Smart Building Environment","confLoc":"Hainan, China","sourcePdf":"3431b437.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067417S","chronDate":"13-15 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4734038","isNumber":"4734155","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4734038","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4734155","articleId":"4734251","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4734277,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Dai","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Dai","id":"37272570700"},{"name":"Xiaochun Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37634981600"},{"name":"Shaomin Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shaomin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37403495500"},{"name":"Huaijian Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huaijian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37600255200"},{"name":"Yi Yu","affiliation":["Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, CN"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37422280700"},{"name":"Xiaoxiang Zheng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Biomedical Engineering of Ministry of Education, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoxiang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37400820500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3431-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2153-1447"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-1463"}],"articleNumber":"4734277","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":69},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Radial basis function networks","Neurons","Educational institutions","Biomedical engineering","Computer science","Educational technology","Instruments","Laboratories","Computer science education"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric potentials","matched filters","medical computing","neurophysiology","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neuronal spike sorting","two-stage RBF networks","radial basis function network method","neural signal simulator","white noise","matched filter","neural action potentials"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spike sorting","Neural action potential","RBF"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuronal Spike Sorting Based on 2-Stage RBF Networks","abstract":"In this paper, 2-stage Radial Basis Function (RBF) network method is used for neural spike sorting.

A measurement system for simultaneous wide bandwidth (>100 MHz) and large dynamic range (-70 dBc ACLR) sampled measurements that are needed for the behavioral modeling is presented. Both the measurement system and the performance of the Doherty amplifier are described. The findings are that the well known and widely used parallel Hammerstein model, also denoted the memory polynomial model, is well suitable also for modeling and predistortion of Doherty amplifiers, and that a Doherty amplifier can be designed with only minor memory effects. This is seen in the modeling error, which is reduced by 13 dB, compared with a constant gain, using a memoryless polynomial model and only 6 dB further by adding memory to the model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-16 June 2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-16 June 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4734374/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"June 2006","accessionNumber":"10441373","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wideband characterization of a Doherty amplifier using behavioral modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband characterization of a Doherty amplifier using behavioral modeling","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12192008-00045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049205S","chronDate":"16-16 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4711050","isNumber":"4734329","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711050","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4734329","articleId":"4734374","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4734382,"authors":[{"name":"Ludwig De Locht","affiliation":["Department ELEC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","Wireless Research, IMEC, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ludwig","lastName":"De Locht","id":"37428707800"},{"name":"Yves Rolain","affiliation":["Department ELEC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Rolain","id":"37273826700"},{"name":"Gerd Vandersteen","affiliation":["Department ELEC, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","Wireless Research, IMEC, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Vandersteen","id":"37273077200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7803-9529-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4734382","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4734382","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power amplifiers","Impedance","CMOS technology","Signal design","Voltage","Knee","Modems","Linearity","CMOS process","Information analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","MIMIC","MMIC amplifiers","network synthesis","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power amplifier design","communication front-end","complex modulation schemes","load-pull design technique","multitone excitation signals","CMOS technology","MIMIC","frequency 5 GHz","size 0.13 mum"]}],"abstract":"The performance of any communication front-end depends largely on the efficiency and the linearity of the power amplifier. Power amplifiers are difficult to design since the available design techniques are not valid for the more complex modulation schemes used nowadays. Therefore, one needs to include information about these complex signals in the design strategy. But this information should be used such that it allows the designer to take good design steps. We reviewed the traditionally used load-pull design technique for power amplifier designs using multi-tone excitation signals to MIMIC the real excitation signals. This approach is illustrated on the loadpull characteristics of a 5 GHz power amplifier in 0.13 \u00bfm CMOS technology. This example shows the difference in design choices when using the correct excitation signals. Therefore, it illustrates the importance of these methods and the excitation signal used.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4734329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARFTG.2006.4734382","publicationTitle":"2006 67th ARFTG Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 67th ARFTG Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711050/4734329/04734382.pdf","startPage":"211","endPage":"213","doi":"10.1109/ARFTG.2006.4734382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Designing power amplifiers?

A full 3-D statistical simulation is presented to investigate the impact of geometrical variations on the FinFETs performance. In this work, roughness is introduced by a Fourier analysis of the power spectrum of Gaussian autocorrelation function. The influence of different geometrical variation sources is compared and summarized. The results shows that FinFETs performance is most sensitive to the fin LER, which causes a remarkable shift and fluctuations in threshold voltage, drain induced barrier lower effect (DIBL) and leakage current. The impact of gate LER follows that of fin LER.

A threshold-switching curve is achieved using device simulator, results show that this mechanism can explain the threshold-switching phenomenon.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrothermal effects","Phase change memory","Phase change materials","Temperature","Switches","Nonvolatile memory","Geometry","Amorphous materials","Crystallization","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","logic simulation","phase change memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrothermal coupling","threshold-switching simulation mechanism","phase change memory","PCM cell","nonvolatile memory","scaling design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PCM","Electrothermal","Threshold-switching","Simulation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4734576","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4734576","startPage":"512","endPage":"515","publicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700819/4734459/04734576.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4734459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4734576","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734576/","displayDocTitle":"Electrothermal coupling and threshold-switching simulation study on phase change memory (PCM) Cell","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10440539","htmlLink":"/document/4734576/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrothermal coupling and threshold-switching simulation study on phase change memory (PCM) Cell","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232008-00117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074904S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700819","isNumber":"4734459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700819","xplore-issue":"4734459","articleId":"4734576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4734587,"authors":[{"name":"Liviu Oniciuc","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Liviu","lastName":"Oniciuc","id":"37645889100"},{"name":"Petru Andrei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Petru","lastName":"Andrei","id":"37316097400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2185-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2186-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4734587","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doping","Fluctuations","Random access memory","Circuit noise","Semiconductor device noise","Computational modeling","Circuit simulation","Resource description framework","Semiconductor process modeling","Poisson equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit modelling","integrated circuit noise","MOS memory circuits","Poisson equation","semiconductor doping","SRAM chips","transport processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random doping fluctuation effects","static noise margins","SRAM cells","doping sensitivity approach","circuit perturbation","device transport model","Poisson equation","current continuity","density-gradient equation","mixed-mode simulation","oxide-semiconductor interface","size 30 nm"]}],"abstract":"The effects of random dopant fluctuations (RDF) on the static noise margins (SNM) of 6-T SRAM cells are analyzed by using a doping sensitivity approach. The approach presented in this article is based on a full circuit perturbation theory at the level of each device transport model. The bias points and the magnitude of random dopant induced fluctuations are computed by solving the Poisson, current continuity, and Density-Gradient equations for all the devices self-consistently (mixed-mode simulation). It is shown that random dopant induced fluctuations can significantly impinge on the yield and reliability of SRAM circuits and constitute a fundamental limit for further scaling unless these devices are properly optimized. Simulation results for a well scaled SRAM cell with 30 nm channel length transistors show that the most sensitive regions to doping fluctuations extend for approximately 10 nm below the oxide/semiconductor interface and are located in the middle of the conduction channels for both p-channel and n-channel transistors.","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4734587","publicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700819/4734459/04734587.pdf","startPage":"488","endPage":"491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4734587","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4734459","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4734587","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random doping fluctuation effects on static noise margins of 6-T SRAM cells","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734587/","displayDocTitle":"Random doping fluctuation effects on static noise margins of 6-T SRAM cells","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4734587/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10440550","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random doping fluctuation effects on static noise margins of 6-T SRAM cells","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232008-00128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038302S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700819","isNumber":"4734459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700819","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4734459","articleId":"4734587","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4734588,"authors":[{"name":"K.

However, as scaling down the CMOS technology, the ratio of gate-drain capacitance (C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">gd</sub>\n) to gate-source capacitance (C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">gs</sub>\n) increases. This phenomenon affects the input matching, power gain and noise figure of the LNA circuit. In this paper, we propose the circuit analysis with new analytic equations derived from equivalent circuit of LNA which considered the C\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">gd</sub>\n effect. With this approach, the input power matching, overall trans-conductance and noise figure could be accurately calculated more than conventional equation. Moreover, a design approach is introduced to optimize the LNA circuit. Prior to fabrication of full LNA circuit, optimum bias and width could be determined to maximize FoM.

To ensure the secure information transaction of tags, a scheme of RFID system authentication protocol based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is proposed. However, hardware implementation of ECC processor for RFID tags is a challenge for the requirements of low-power consumption and low-cost chip resource. In the paper we propose a novel ALU architecture for ECC processor on tags. By specially restructured the conventional mathematical expressions of Montgomery algorithm, the ALU operation of point multiplication in our design is reduced by nearly 47%. Also, various multipliers, such as bit-serial multiplier, digit-serial multiplier and the divided algorithm are adopted to balance between power consumption and speed. To attain ultra low power consumption, other techniques, such as finite state machines (FSM) optimization, clock gating, pipelining operations and low-power target library are used in the design. The area of the ECC processor is equal to 16.9 k gates equivalents. It performs an elliptic curve point multiplication in 36174 clock cycles and has a power consumption of 6.607 \u00bfW at 1.28 MHz using TSMC 0.18 \u00bfm low-voltage cell library.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734876/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10440835","htmlLink":"/document/4734876/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-power hardware implementation of ECC processor suitable for low-cost RFID tags","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power hardware implementation of ECC processor suitable for low-cost RFID tags","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232008-00417.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056723S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700819","isNumber":"4734459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700819","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4734459","articleId":"4734876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4734878,"authors":[{"name":"Li Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Air Force Radar Academy, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Li Lu","id":"37087272513"},{"name":"Jianming Lei","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Jianming Lei","id":"37087271493"},{"name":"Linlin Bing","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Linlin Bing","id":"37087272436"},{"name":"Xuecheng Zou","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science & Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Xuecheng Zou","id":"37087192870"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2185-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2186-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4734878","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Optical fiber communication","Optical feedback","Optical signal processing","Transversal filters","Optical transmitters","Optical receivers","Bit error rate","Maximum likelihood estimation","Pulse amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalisers","optical receivers","optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision feedback equalizer","optical communications","electronic dispersion compensation","transmitter","receiver","chromatic dispersion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DFE","EDC","Linearly Decomposition","10 Gb/s","Optical Communications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4734878","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4734878","publicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","abstract":"In this paper, a novel structure of linearly decomposed decision feedback equalizer (DFE) is proposed, which is used in electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) for high bit-rate optical communications.

Each member of the family is different either in the types of functional blocks contained or in the number of blocks of each type. The parametrized design methodology is presented here to achieve this goal. Even though our focus is on the programming circuitry that provides the interface between the FPGA core circuit and the external programming hardware, the parametrized design method can be generalized to the design of entire chip for all members in the FPGA family. The method presented here covers the generation of the design RTL files and the support files for synthesis, place-and-route layout and simulations. The proposed method is proven to work smoothly within the complete chip design methodology.

This paper concentrated on the scalability issue based on an in-house developed crossbar NoC, which consisted of fully connected channels for every pair of processors through transmitter, receiver and links. The major contributions are the following: implemented the NoC prototyped on FPGA with extended processor number from 4 to 6, evaluated the whole chip performance on pipelined-matrix-multiplication (PMM) benchmark and analyzed the scalability of the crossbar NoC in terms of area and performance.

paper, we have proposed a new high precision ramp waveform generator for low cost ADC test. With proposed test method combined with histogram analysis, an ADC can be easily tested on general digital testers. In our approach, we combine a traditional ramp generator with proper gain of operational amplifier (OPA) for ADC test. This new ramp generator structure can reduce the effect of output resistance (Ro) and then get the smaller integral nonlinearity (INL) error. Eventually, we have designed a ramp generator chip using TSMC CMOS 0.35\u03bcm 2P4M technology. The core area without I/O pad is 144\u03bcmx277\u03bcm, operation voltage is 3.3V. Experimental results show that the chip has a ramp signal of 2V full range with duration of 100\u03bcS and measured a maximum INL of 20\u03bcV only. The linearity of the ramp waveform equals to 16 bits resolution. Such linearity allows the test of ADC up to 14 bits.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734982/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4734982/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10440941","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A high precision ramp generator for low cost ADC test","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high precision ramp generator for low cost ADC test","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232008-00523.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045502S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700819","isNumber":"4734459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700819","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4734459","articleId":"4734982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4734987,"authors":[{"name":"Botao Sun","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, China"],"lastName":"Botao Sun","id":"37650252600"},{"name":"Jianhua Feng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, China"],"lastName":"Jianhua Feng","id":"37399556700"},{"name":"Teng Lin","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Microelectronic Devices and Circuits, Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, China"],"lastName":"Teng Lin","id":"37654758500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2185-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2186-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4734987","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"abstract":"With the increased use of FPGA in widespread applications, its\u00bf size and speed has been rapidly increased, so more and more problems associated with performance defects are emerging. Performance defects such as delay defects will not lead to a functional fault, but will limit the frequency of the system. Only Stuck-at testing has not been sufficient to guarantee the reliability and quality, so testing delay fault becomes necessary. In this paper, in order to improve the efficiency and coverage of delay test, we first select the most suitable delay fault model for FPGAs, which is a good simulation for the actual situation. At the same time we proposed a new configuration on the basis of this. This method takes full advantage of the FPGAs\u00bf reconfiguration feature. It not only omits complex test pattern generation, but also optimizes the BIST circuits to minimize the area cost, and reaches higher fault coverage. To verify the theory, we use Xilinx vertex4 devices on the experimental test, and achieved approving results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700819/4734459/04734987.pdf","startPage":"2083","endPage":"2086","publicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4734987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4734987","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4734459","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4734987","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new configuration scheme for delay test in non-simple LUT FPGA designs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Testing","Table lookup","Field programmable gate arrays","Circuit faults","Frequency","Circuit simulation","Test pattern generators","Built-in self-test","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","field programmable gate arrays","logic testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","delay fault model","delay defects","performance defects","stuck-at testing","fault testing","built-in self test"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","configuration","delay-test","LUT","MUX"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A new configuration scheme for delay test in non-simple LUT FPGA designs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4734987/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10440946","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new configuration scheme for delay test in non-simple LUT FPGA designs","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232008-00528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045862S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700819","isNumber":"4734459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700819","xplore-issue":"4734459","articleId":"4734987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4734988,"authors":[{"name":"Li Dai","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Li Dai","id":"37651886700"},{"name":"Zhi-bin Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Zhi-bin Liu","id":"37652340900"},{"name":"Shao-chi Liang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Shao-chi Liang","id":"37651216600"},{"name":"Meng Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Meng Yang","id":"37290778800"},{"name":"Ling-li Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC & Systems, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Ling-li Wang","id":"37293108200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2185-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2186-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4734988","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":205},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Testing","Switches","Circuit faults","Routing","Logic","Wiring","Integrated circuit interconnections","Wire","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","interconnections","network routing","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA interconnect testing algorithm","routing-resource graph","static-random-access-memory","SRAM configuration cell","Fudan design system","open faults","PIPs fault configuration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4734988","abstract":"Static-random-access-memory(SRAM)-based field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) consists of 50% ~70% routing resources.

This paper describes the designs and implementations of new automatic white balance method and color interpolation method on FPGA. This white balance method can effectively get the better of the defects of gray world and gray world-retinex methods by calculating the average deviation values of Cr and Cb. This color interpolation method can greatly reduce the artifacts causing by interpolating across edges with comparing the differences of neighboring pixels with the predefined thresholds. These two methods have been realized on Altera\u00bfs FPGA EP1C12Q240C8. Experimental results show that the white balance method can obtain better image quality than gray world and gray world-retinex methods, and the color interpolation method can get high PSNR value. They can be good candidate for VLSI implementation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4734459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4734994","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4734994","publicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700819/4734459/04734994.pdf","startPage":"2152","endPage":"2155","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","CMOS image sensors","Field programmable gate arrays","Interpolation","Sensor arrays","Color","Filters","Signal processing","Chromium","Image quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","interpolation","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing technique","CMOS image sensor","FPGA EP1C12Q240C8","automatic white balance method","color filter array interpolation","image signal processor","VLSI implementation"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and implementation of two key image processing techniques for CMOS image sensor based on fpga","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4734994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4734994/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design and implementation of two key image processing techniques for CMOS image sensor based on fpga","htmlLink":"/document/4734994/","accessionNumber":"10440953","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and implementation of two key image processing techniques for CMOS image sensor based on fpga","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232008-00535.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041027S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700819","isNumber":"4734459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700819","xplore-issue":"4734459","articleId":"4734994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4735000,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Chen Chen","id":"37087537871"},{"name":"Yun Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Yun Chen","id":"37087255399"},{"name":"Xiaoyang Zeng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ASIC and System, Fudan University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoyang Zeng","id":"37087065204"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2185-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2186-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4735000","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4735000","abstract":"This paper proposes a low power convolver in channel estimation.

Considering the limited dynamic range of wavelet coefficients, a modified scheme of integer-to-integer discrete wavelet transform based on fixed-point manipulation is proposed by preserving efficiently fractions of coefficients in lifting steps. This scheme ensures higher computational precision in DWT and accordingly improves the compression quality. The corresponding line-based FPGA lifting scheme is put forward from hardware perspective. In a parallel way, transform can be row-wise and column-wise executed. Prototyped onto Xilinx Virtex-II FPGA, the proposed architecture requires fewer resources and memory accesses, but reaches a higher processing throughput. Experimental results provide parameters as follows. For an image with resolution 1024\u00d71024, the inputting sampling is up to 61 Mpixels/s when DWT is working at the clock of 65 MHz. Internal memory of only 5 rows is required for the 9/7 filter to perform one-level 2-D decomposition. The completion of multi-level DWT is within the time T that an image is transmitted in line order.","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4735007","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4735007","publicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700819/4734459/04735007.pdf","startPage":"2200","endPage":"2203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4734459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735007/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient FPGA implementation of modified DWT for JPEG2000","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10440966","htmlLink":"/document/4735007/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient FPGA implementation of modified DWT for JPEG2000","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232008-00548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05594S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700819","isNumber":"4734459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700819","xplore-issue":"4734459","articleId":"4735007","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4735008,"authors":[{"name":"Liangwei Ge","affiliation":["Graduate School ofInformation, Production and System, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"lastName":"Liangwei Ge","id":"37087895218"},{"name":"Song Chen","affiliation":["Graduate School ofInformation, Production and System, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"lastName":"Song Chen","id":"37087304250"},{"name":"Takeshi Yoshimura","affiliation":["Graduate School ofInformation, Production and System, Waseda University, Kitakyushu, Japan"],"lastName":"Takeshi Yoshimura","id":"37087361844"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2185-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2186-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4735008","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":52},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Polynomials","Acceleration","Throughput","Artificial neural networks","Neural network hardware","Delay","Neurons","Production systems","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronic engineering computing","neural nets","nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed pipelined implementation","squashing functions","neural networks","nonlinear systems","time-consuming task","hardware acceleration","floating-point squashing functions","domain partition algorithm","coefficient compression method","memory usage","error rate","synthesis speedup","flop-flops usage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4735008","abstract":"Neural networks are powerful tool to simulate nonlinear systems. However, obtaining reliable neural networks is usually a time-consuming task, which requires repeated training of the networks with the available data. Recently, some attempts to accelerate the neural network training by utilizing paralleled hardware have been proposed. One of the challenges in hardware acceleration is implementing the floating-point squashing functions, like sigmoid(x) and tanh(x), that have vast input domain. However, previous implementations of squashing functions either suffer from low speed and poor accuracy or require large area and lots of manual works. In this paper, we present an automatic method to implement the squashing functions. Based on the proposed domain partition algorithm and coefficient compression method, squashing functions with smaller size, faster speed, and higher precision are obtained. Experiment on sigmoid(x) shows that less memory usage, up to 20 k times smaller error rate, 300 times synthesis speedup, and 50% reduction of LUTs and flop-flops usage are achieved than conventional method.","doi":"10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4735008","startPage":"2204","endPage":"2207","publicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSICT.2008.4735008","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4734459","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 9th International Conference on Solid-State and Integrated-Circuit Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4700819/4734459/04735008.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed, pipelined implementation of squashing functions in neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735008/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-speed, pipelined implementation of squashing functions in neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4735008/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10440967","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed, pipelined implementation of squashing functions in neural networks","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"SPI-12232008-00549.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063143S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4700819","isNumber":"4734459","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4700819","xplore-issue":"4734459","articleId":"4735008","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4735010,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Ao","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lei Ao","id":"38273217600"},{"name":"Lai Lin-Hui","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lai Lin-Hui","id":"38272165200"},{"name":"Li Xiao-Jin","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Li Xiao-Jin","id":"38273757500"},{"name":"Lai Zong-Sheng","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, East China Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Lai Zong-Sheng","id":"38271218000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2185-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2186-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4735010","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","Frequency estimation","OFDM","Transmitters","Digital video broadcasting","Analytical models","Performance analysis","Digital audio broadcasting","Channel estimation","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency synchronization","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","carrier frequency errors","overall frequency estimator","inter-carrier interference","time domain synchronous OFDM"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are highly sensitive to ICI caused by carrier frequency errors, so reliable time and frequency synchronization is crucial for the system.

The shaped-beam planar array is employed to be an element of Very Large Array for the deep space detection. A conventional genetic algorithm is chosen for the optimization. However, the synthesis of a flat-top shaped beam using a planar 2-D array is difficult because of the inherently large number of degrees of freedom involved in the algorithm (in generally, the amplitude and phase of each element must be determined). Therefore, a sub-array rotation method, which lies on the flat-top pattern synthesis itself, is proposed in this study to resolve the design problem. A 10\u00d710 (100) element array is employed, and the results of the optimized flat-top pattern are shown to illustrate the validity and high efficiency of the technique.","doi":"10.1109/ISAPE.2008.4735318","startPage":"729","endPage":"732","publicationTitle":"2008 8th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2008.4735318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735123","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711035/4735123/04735318.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Optimization of Flat-top Patterns using Genetic Algorithm for the Deep Space Detection Application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735318/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Optimization of Flat-top Patterns using Genetic Algorithm for the Deep Space Detection Application","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4735318/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10517988","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Optimization of Flat-top Patterns using Genetic Algorithm for the Deep Space Detection Application","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12172008-00195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069848S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711035","isNumber":"4735123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711035","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4735123","articleId":"4735318","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4735323,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-lin Chen","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Laboratory, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Hai-lin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293463900"},{"name":"Bin Chen","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Laboratory, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37292996400"},{"name":"Yun-fei Mao","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Laboratory, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yun-fei Mao","id":"37592613100"},{"name":"Yun Yi","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Laboratory, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yun Yi","id":"37289047300"},{"name":"Bi-hua Zhou","affiliation":["Electromagnetic Laboratory, Nanjing Engineering Institute, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Bi-hua Zhou","id":"37274374300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2192-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2193-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4735323","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":75},"abstract":"To reduce memory requirement, the divergence theorem is introduced into the WLP-BOR-FDTD method.

The performance of GA is analyzed by simulation and the results show that the minor-lobes level of the array after optimized by GA is much lower and the antenna will work well over wide band.","doi":"10.1109/ISAPE.2008.4735356","startPage":"871","endPage":"874","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711035/4735123/04735356.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 8th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2008.4735356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and optimization of liner phased array antennas with different distance based on genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Design optimization","Antenna arrays","Genetic algorithms","Directive antennas","Radar antennas","Optimization methods","Helium","Genetic engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","antenna radiation patterns","genetic algorithms","linear antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["different distance","genetic algorithm","minor-lobes level","fitness function","first null direction","linear phased array antennas","nonlinear function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design and optimization of liner phased array antennas with different distance based on genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4735356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10518024","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and optimization of liner phased array antennas with different distance based on genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Kunming","sourcePdf":"SPI-12172008-00233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140827S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711035","isNumber":"4735123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711035","xplore-issue":"4735123","articleId":"4735356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4735358,"authors":[{"name":"Song Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","School of Sciences, University of Nanchang, Nanchang, China"],"lastName":"Song Liu","id":"37422775600"},{"name":"Shaobin Liu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Shaobin Liu","id":"37292598300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2192-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2193-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4735358","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Plasma waves","Magnetic anisotropy","Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy","Electromagnetic propagation","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic wave polarization","Numerical analysis","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Electromagnetic scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","magnetic anisotropy","Maxwell equations","plasma electromagnetic wave propagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD method","EM Propagation","perpendicular magnetic declination","finite-difference time-domain method","exponential time differencing scheme","anisotropic magnetized plasma","electromagnetic wave propagation direction","ordinary polarized wave","magnetized plasma layer"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method employing the Exponential Time Differencing (ETD) scheme is applied to the numerical analysis of anisotropic magnetized plasma with the propagation direction of the electromagnetic wave is perpendicular to the biasing field direction.

beamforming for near-space wide-swath SAR imaging","abstract":"Inspired by recent advances in near-space technology and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique, this paper presents one digital beamforming-based near-space wide-swath imaging technique. Near-space defined as the space region between 20 km and 100 km, which is above storms and not constrained by orbital mechanics like satellite or high fuel consumption like airplane. These advantages make many new capabilities that are not accessible to current spaceborne or airborne SAR being possible for near-space SAR. This also offers an opportunity to design new SAR imaging technique. This paper deals with conceptual design, as opposed to technological implementation. Multiple beams in azimuth are used to suppress the possible azimuth ambiguities for near-space high-resolution and wide-swath SAR imaging. An example near-space wide-swath SAR is conceptually designed. Simulation results show that the combination of digital beamforming technology and near-space platform can provide a promising solution for remote sensing applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735456/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10517808","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4735456/","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Digital beamforming for near-space wide-swath SAR imaging","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital beamforming for near-space wide-swath SAR imaging","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12172008-00333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104197S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711035","isNumber":"4735123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711035","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4735123","articleId":"4735456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4735464,"authors":[{"name":"Xiangbin Yu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiangbin Yu","id":"37280836300"},{"name":"Guangguo Bi","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Guangguo Bi","id":"37280818800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2192-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2193-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4735464","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"abstract":"By introducing a full-rate space-time block coding (STBC) scheme, a multiuser CDMA system with full-rate STBC is presented. Meanwhile, a low-complexity multiuser receiver scheme is developed, the scheme can make full use of the complex orthogonality of STBC to simplify the high decoding complexity of the existing scheme, it has linear decoding complexity. Compared with those full-diversity space-time block coded CDMA (STBC-CDMA) systems, the presented full-rate STBC-CDMA system can realize full rate transmission, low complexity and form efficient spatial interleaving. Thus the concatenation of channel coding can effectively improve the system performance. Simulation results show that the developed scheme can achieve almost the same performance as the existing scheme. Moreover, on the condition of same system throughput and concatenation of channel code, the proposed full-rate system has lower BER than corresponding full-diversity systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711035/4735123/04735464.pdf","startPage":"1302","endPage":"1305","publicationTitle":"2008 8th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISAPE.2008.4735464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2008.4735464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735123","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4735464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Receiver scheme for space-time coded CDMA system with multiple antennae","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Maximum likelihood decoding","Diversity reception","Decorrelation","Slot antennas","Channel coding","Mobile antennas","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","code division multiple access","decoding","error statistics","multifrequency antennas","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver scheme","CDMA system","multiple antennae","space-time block coding","low-complexity multiuser receiver","decoding complexity","channel coding","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Receiver scheme for space-time coded CDMA system with multiple antennae","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4735464/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10517816","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Receiver scheme for space-time coded CDMA system with multiple antennae","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12172008-00341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051192S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711035","isNumber":"4735123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711035","xplore-issue":"4735123","articleId":"4735464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4735471,"authors":[{"name":"Fei You","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Fei You","id":"37087302683"},{"name":"Songbai He","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Songbai He","id":"37087302851"},{"name":"Xiaohong Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Xiaohong Tang","id":"37087368782"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2192-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2193-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4735471","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Power amplifiers","Amplitude modulation","Voltage","Distortion","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Circuits","Frequency modulation","Power engineering and energy","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class E power amplifier","collector AM bandwidth","amplitude modulation","load network","DC analysis model"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4735471","abstract":"The Class E amplifier\u2019s amplitude modulation mainly relies on the collector DC voltage variations, and the relation between the output signal\u2019s envelop and the modulating signal is linear in theory, but this is actually impossible.

At the transmitter, subjected to the total transmit power constraint, the proposed ATPA scheme is used to allocate proper power for every sub-stream based on imperfect channel state information (I-CSI) and the statistical characteristic of channel estimation errors. At the receiver the modified minimum mean square error (MMSE) detector which takes into account the errors of channel estimation is used to remove the co-antenna interference (CAI) in order to improve BER performance further. Simulation results show that the proposed ATPA algorithm is effective for V-BLAST system under imperfect CSI, the BER performance is better than that with equal power allocation.

In this paper a method was proposed to realize accurate control of downlink and uplink timeslots of the TD-SCDMA repeater, thus preventing interference between adjacent downlink and uplink timeslots, where the procedure is performed by sub-frame synchronization and time-delay estimation. The method presented in these pages allows to have a higher reliability and accuracy with respect to the methods described in the UTRAN standard for TDD-LCR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4711035/4735123/04735512.pdf","startPage":"1486","endPage":"1489","publicationTitle":"2008 8th International Symposium on Antennas, Propagation and EM Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISAPE.2008.4735512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAPE.2008.4735512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735123","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4735512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of downlink and uplink timeslots switch of the TD-SCDMA wireless repeater","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Downlink","Time division synchronous code division multiple access","Repeaters","Decision support systems","Fiber reinforced plastics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","radio access networks","radio repeaters","space division multiple access","synchronisation","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication switching","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink timeslot switch","downlink timeslot switch","TD-SCDMA wireless repeater","radio access systems","time division synchronous code multiple access radio system","interference minimization","traffic capacity","subframe synchronization","time-delay estimation","UTRAN standard"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735512/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of downlink and uplink timeslots switch of the TD-SCDMA wireless repeater","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4735512/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10517943","dateOfInsertion":"16 March 2009","conferenceDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of downlink and uplink timeslots switch of the TD-SCDMA wireless repeater","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12172008-00389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031431S","chronDate":"2-5 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4711035","isNumber":"4735123","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4711035","xplore-issue":"4735123","articleId":"4735512","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4735521,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-gong Wang","affiliation":["The Telecommunication Engineering Institute, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Wang Wei-gong","id":"37085977200"},{"name":"Xin-yu Da","affiliation":["The Telecommunication Engineering Institute, Air Force Engineering University, Xi'an, China"],"lastName":"Da Xin-yu","id":"37533679000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2192-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2193-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4735521","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Multipath channels","Scattering","Adaptive arrays","Loaded antennas","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Modulation coding","OFDM modulation","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","block codes","electromagnetic wave scattering","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","adaptive bit loading","SFBC-OFDM","WSSUS multipath channels","adaptive modulation","space-frequency block coded","wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering","transmitter antennas","receiver antennas","scattering function"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies an adaptive modulation technique combined with space-frequency block coded OFDM (SFBC-OFDM) over wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) multipath channels.

The transceiver is designed to support very low-power, chip-to-chip optical data buses on printed circuit boards at data rates up to 10 Gb/s/channel. Optical interfaces to the chip are provided by 16-channel photodiode (PD) and VCSEL arrays directly flip-chip soldered to the CMOS IC. The resulting complete transceivers, or optochips, are low-cost, low-profile highly-integrated chip-scale components. The packaging approach, dense hybrid-integration of optical devices with CMOS, facilitates further scaling to even larger 2-D arrays for future massively parallel optical data buses. Comparison with a previously reported high-speed transceiver Optochip is provided to provide insight into the design space of dense CMOS-based parallel optical transceivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Power 16 x 10 Gb/s Bi-Directional Single Chip CMOS Optical Transceivers Operating at \u226a 5 mW/Gb/s/link","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2007439","startPage":"301","endPage":"313","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2007439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4735533/04735545.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4735545","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735545/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Power 16 x 10 Gb/s Bi-Directional Single Chip CMOS Optical Transceivers Operating at \u226a 5 mW/Gb/s/link","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"44","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4735545/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10370963","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Power 16 x 10 Gb/s Bi-Directional Single Chip CMOS Optical Transceivers Operating at \u226a 5 mW/Gb/s/link","sourcePdf":"jssc-schow-2007439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094992S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4735533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4735533","articleId":"4735545","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4735548,"authors":[{"name":"Dinesh Somasekhar","affiliation":["Circuit Research Labs, Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4735533/4735548/4735548-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dinesh Somasekhar received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering from the Maharaja Sayajirao University, Baroda, India, in 1989, the M.E degree in electrical communications engineering from Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 1991, and the Ph.D. degree from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, in 1995.","From 1991 to 1994, he was an I.C.

Two error-detection sequential (EDS) circuits are introduced to preserve the timing-error detection capability of previous EDS designs while lowering clock energy and removing datapath metastability. One EDS circuit is a dynamic transition detector with a time-borrowing datapath latch (TDTB). The other EDS circuit is a double-sampling static design with a time-borrowing datapath latch (DSTB). In comparison to previous EDS designs, TDTB and DSTB redirect the highly complex metastability problem from both the datapath and error path to only the error path, enabling a drastic simplification in managing metastability. From a survey of various EDS circuit options, TDTB represents the lowest clock energy EDS circuit known; DSTB represents the lowest clock energy static-EDS circuit with SER protection known.

The same chip operating as an 8 Gb SLC device guarantees over 60 MB/s programming throughput. The newly introduced all bit line (ABL) architecture has multiple advantages when higher performance is targeted and it was made possible by adopting the ldquocurrent sensingrdquo (as opposed to the mainstream ldquovoltage sensingrdquo) technique. The general chip architecture is presented in contrast to a state of the art conventional circuit and a double size data buffer is found to be necessary for the maximum parallelism attained. Further conceptual changes designed to counterbalance the area increase are presented, hierarchical column architecture being of foremost importance. Optimization of other circuits, such as the charge pump, is another example. Fast data access rate is essential, and ways of boosting it are described, including a new redundancy scheme. ABL contribution to energy saving is also acknowledged.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2007152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2007152","startPage":"186","endPage":"194","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4735533/04735566.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 34 MB/s MLC Write Throughput 16 Gb NAND With All Bit Line Architecture on 56 nm Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 34 MB/s MLC Write Throughput 16 Gb NAND With All Bit Line Architecture on 56 nm Technology","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370971","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4735566/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 34 MB/s MLC Write Throughput 16 Gb NAND With All Bit Line Architecture on 56 nm Technology","sourcePdf":"jssc-cernea-2007152.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154955S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4735533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"4735533","articleId":"4735566","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4735567,"authors":[{"name":"Ferdinando Bedeschi","affiliation":["Numonyx, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Ferdinando","lastName":"Bedeschi","id":"37270597800"},{"name":"Rich Fackenthal","affiliation":["Numonyx, Folsom, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Rich","lastName":"Fackenthal","id":"37352791500"},{"name":"Claudio Resta","affiliation":["Studio di Microelettronica, STMicroelectronics, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Resta","id":"37270603600"},{"name":"Enzo Michele Donze","affiliation":["Numonyx, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Enzo Michele","lastName":"Donze","id":"37659774800"},{"name":"Meenatchi Jagasivamani","affiliation":["Numonyx, Folsom, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Meenatchi","lastName":"Jagasivamani","id":"37659775000"},{"name":"Egidio Cassiodoro Buda","affiliation":["Numonyx, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Egidio Cassiodoro","lastName":"Buda","id":"37268695600"},{"name":"Fabio Pellizzer","affiliation":["Numonyx, Agrate-Brianza, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Pellizzer","id":"37275678000"},{"name":"David W.

Error detection is based on flagging spurious transitions in the state-holding latch node. The RazorII flip-flop naturally detects logic and register SER. We implement a 64-bit processor in 0.13 mum technology which uses RazorII for SER tolerance and dynamic supply adaptation. RazorII based DVS allows elimination of safety margins and operation at the point of first failure of the processor. We tested and measured 32 different dies and obtained 33% energy savings over traditional DVS using RazorII for supply voltage control.

The test chip comprises of sixteen 512 kb instances and is designed for use as the principal compilable one-port embedded-SRAM block in a 45 nm ASIC library. Challenges associated with SRAM cell design in SOI are overcome and resulted in a cell size of 0.315 mum\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n . The paper introduces two circuit techniques that address the AC and DC power consumption issues facing today's embedded-SRAMs. The first technique addresses AC power dissipation by utilizing a two-stage, body-contacted sensing scheme that, among other improvements, achieves a 68% improvement in read power under constant voltage and frequency compared to the previous generation macro . The second technique addresses the DC power consumption by introducing a single-device, header based dynamic leakage suppression scheme that reduces total macro leakage power by 38% with no wake-up cycle requirements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735569/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4735569/","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370967","volume":"44","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An 8 Mb SRAM in 45 nm SOI Featuring a Two-Stage Sensing Scheme and Dynamic Power Management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An 8 Mb SRAM in 45 nm SOI Featuring a Two-Stage Sensing Scheme and Dynamic Power Management","sourcePdf":"jssc-ramadurai-2006433.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056542S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4735533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4735533","articleId":"4735569","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4735570,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Li","affiliation":["NAND Design Department, SanDisk Corporation, Milpitas, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4735533/4735570/4735570-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yan Li received the B.S. degree in physics from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 1986.

A new advanced cache program algorithm provides another 15% improvement in write performance. This paper also discusses a technique for resolving the sensing error resulting from cell source line noise, which usually varies with the data pattern. The new architecture and advanced algorithm enable an 8 MB/s write performance that is comparable to previously published 2-bit per cell (4-level) NAND performance. Considering the significant cost reduction compared to 4-level NAND flash based on the same technology, this chip is a strong candidate for many mainstream applications.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2008.2007154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2008.2007154","startPage":"195","endPage":"207","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4735533/04735570.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 16 Gb 3-Bit Per Cell (X3) NAND Flash Memory on 56 nm Technology With 8 MB/s Write Rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","displayDocTitle":"A 16 Gb 3-Bit Per Cell (X3) NAND Flash Memory on 56 nm Technology With 8 MB/s Write Rate","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","accessionNumber":"10370969","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4735570/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 16 Gb 3-Bit Per Cell (X3) NAND Flash Memory on 56 nm Technology With 8 MB/s Write Rate","sourcePdf":"jssc-li-2007154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172031S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4735533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4735533","articleId":"4735570","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4735616,"authors":[{"name":"Guido Vagliasindi","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica Elettronica e dei Sistemi, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Catania, Catania, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/4735602/4735616/4735616-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Guido Vagliasindi (S'04) was born in Catania, Italy, in 1979.

These new materials will require particular care when the machine operates, considering that they are much more vulnerable than the present combination of graphite and stainless steel. Early detection of hot spots, which are regions of the first wall where the temperature approaches dangerous levels, is considered one essential element in the safety strategy. In this paper, cellular nonlinear networks (CNNs) are applied to the task of detecting hot spots in the infrared images of JET wide-angle camera. The ability of the CNNs to process the pixels of the images in parallel makes this technology a very good candidate for this task. Various algorithms are presented, which can locate the hot regions in any part of the image with a temporal resolution on the order of 60 ms, which is considered adequate for safety purposes at JET. In addition to the frame-by-frame static identification of the hot spots, their evolution in time is also followed to determine if they approach dangerous parts of the vacuum vessel. The potential of the CNNs would therefore allow for the implementation of alternative protection strategies, such as following the increase and displacement of the hot spots inside the entire vacuum vessel and identifying particles dropping into the plasma. </para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 December 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10370770","volume":"37","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4735616/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"First Application of Cellular Nonlinear Network Methods to the Real-Time Identification of Hot Spots in JET","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"First Application of Cellular Nonlinear Network Methods to the Real-Time Identification of Hot Spots in JET","sourcePdf":"tps-vagliasindi-2005985.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048292S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"4735602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4735602","articleId":"4735616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4735686,"authors":[{"name":"Ma Tao","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ma","lastName":"Tao","id":"37545333200"},{"name":"Chen Jie","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Jie","id":"37293289000"},{"name":"Chen Wenjie","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Wenjie","id":"37284844700"},{"name":"Deng Fang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Deng","lastName":"Fang","id":"37532432800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2367-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2368-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4735686","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Control systems","Hysteresis","Piezoelectric actuators","Inverse problems","Adaptive systems","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Nonlinear control systems","Nonlinear systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control nonlinearities","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","piezoelectric actuators","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive inverse control scheme","piezoelectric actuator","Prandtle-Ishlinskii model","radial basis function neural network","nonlinear systems","unknown hysteresis nonlinearity","nonlinear filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4735686","abstract":"A model of piezoelectric actuator with hysteresis has been built in this paper with Prandtle-Ishlinskii model.

In this paper, silicon cantilever that can sense micro/nano objects without the aid of any label for sensing has been designed and analyzed. In order to do so, deformation of cantilever itself will act as sensing unit. Finite element method was employed for design implementation. Design target is to achieve high sensitivity in bending without the use of fluorescence or radioactive label. Design parameters under consideration were length and thickness of the cantilever. Finite element model was developed as a thin cantilever of uniform rectangular cross-section discretized with 8-node quadrilateral brick elements. The micro-scaled mechanical properties of silicon were taken from published reports. For the purpose of having objects to be sensed, differential surface stress and additional weight in sub-micron scale were created as disturbance to the cantilever. Linear static stress analyses were performed to extract the amount of bending and the stress induced by different loadings. Finite element modeling and design analysis were implemented in general-purpose FE code. The results show that the feasible size of silicon cantilever that can sense any object at micron or sub-micron scale is 1000 times 100 times 0.4 mum provided that it does not impose the fabrication problem.","doi":"10.1109/MESA.2008.4735710","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechtronic and Embedded Systems and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE/ASME International Conference on Mechtronic and Embedded Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721588/4735645/04735710.pdf","startPage":"89","endPage":"93","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MESA.2008.4735710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735645","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design Analysis of Silicon Cantilever for Label-less Sensing using Finite Element Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4735710","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735710/","displayDocTitle":"Design Analysis of Silicon Cantilever for Label-less Sensing using Finite Element Method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10453231","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4735710/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Analysis of Silicon Cantilever for Label-less Sensing using Finite Element Method","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"MESA-00-65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042904S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721588","isNumber":"4735645","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721588","xplore-issue":"4735645","articleId":"4735710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4735713,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin C.

The performance of RGA and PSO is compared with respect to time-response specifications, computation time and statistical performance in 20 independent trials. The simulation reveals that the performance of PSO and RGA with simulated binary crossover (SBX) produced almost same time-domain performances and take same computation time. Also, it is found that PSO converges with less number of functional evaluations, consistent for simple systems and in general ITAE is preferable for quick settling time.","startPage":"81","endPage":"86","displayPublicationTitle":"2007 IET-UK International Conference on Information and Communication Technology in Electrical Sciences (ICTES 2007)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4717991/4735760/04735775.pdf","publicationTitle":"2007 IET-UK International Conference on Information and Communication Technology in Electrical Sciences (ICTES 2007)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4735760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of PID parameters using Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","linear systems","particle swarm optimisation","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PID parameters","particle swarm optimization","optimum PID controller design","real coded genetic algorithm","Ziegler-Nichols method","linear systems","time-response specifications","statistical performance","simulated binary crossover"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PID controller","Tuning","Genetic algorithm (GA)","Particle Swarm optimization (PSO)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4735775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2007","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of PID parameters using Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2007","accessionNumber":"10215089","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of PID parameters using Genetic Algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034961S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2007","isNumber":"4735760","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4717991","citationCount":"5","articleId":"4735775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4735883,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Unusually, the materials of the package construction are sourced from outside the semiconductor industry. This is done to keep costs as low as possible. The process technology is wholly scaleable so the same tool set can be used irrespective of the wafer diameter.

We also comment the value of the approach based on limited computational results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4736042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WSC.2008.4736198","publicationTitle":"2008 Winter Simulation Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Winter Simulation Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4712635/4736042/04736198.pdf","startPage":"1259","endPage":"1267","doi":"10.1109/WSC.2008.4736198","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid approach based on multi-agent geosimulation and reinforcement learning to solve a UAV patrolling problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid approach based on multi-agent geosimulation and reinforcement learning to solve a UAV patrolling problem","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4736198/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10441537","dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4736198/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid approach based on multi-agent geosimulation and reinforcement learning to solve a UAV patrolling problem","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052112S","chronDate":"7-10 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4712635","isNumber":"4736042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4712635","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4736042","articleId":"4736198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4736301,"authors":[{"name":"Li-Pei Wong","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["LI-PEI WONG obtained his Bachelor degree and Master degree in Computer Science from Science University of Malaysia in 2001 and 2004.

We consider a scheduling problem for assembling MCPs. In order to assemble an MCP, a lot should repeat assembly process stages such as die attach and wire bonding as many as the number of chips to be assembled. The two key process stages have many parallel machines of various types. A machine processes different types of MCP lots with significant setup times. We therefore should limit the number of setups significantly while not sacrificing the on-time delivery performance much.

In this paper, we propose a novel MAC protocol in multi-channel wireless networks by using dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) based on cognitive radio for QoS support. According to the user request, variable spectrum is allocated for quality of service (QoS) guarantee through DSA mechanism. Dynamic spectrum allocation is implemented with the procedure of FRQ/FRP/ACK-hello over a control channel, DATA/ACK over allocated data channels. For cooperative detection, a hello message is exchanged periodically to enhance the spectrum sharing in our MAC protocol.

A new approach is proposed using the concept of decomposing the long adaptive filter into low order multiple sub-filters in which the error signals are independent on each other. The independency of the error signals exhibits the parallelism technique. A novel class of efficient and robust adaptive algorithms. It exhibits fast convergence, superior tracking capabilities of the signal statistics. The proposed algorithm is also compared with multiple sub-filters approach used for acoustic echo cancellation as the technique of decomposition of error. It is generally found that adaptive LMS algorithm with lower order has faster convergence. In most of the cases, the eigen-value spread of the auto correlation decreases as the order of the filter decreases except for white input. We discuss also the complexity of our proposed design to show how our design has a good performance. Modern (FPGAs) include the resources needed to design efficient filtering structures. The modeling of the acoustic echo path was represented by using three sub-adaptive filters of order=10 with fixed step size =0.05/3 for each adaptive filter. We use sinusoidal input signal with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) which has different signal-to-noise ratio (SNRs) to examine our approach. The steady state error of our proposed technique is still high as the technique of decomposition of error. This steady state error is small with respect to using one long adaptive filter and this will be obvious in our simulation results. This paper addresses also the problems of blind source separation (BSS). In blind source separation, signals from multiple sources arrive simultaneously at a sensor array, so that each sensor output contains a mixture of source signals. Sets of sensor outputs are processed to recover the source signals from the mixed observations. The term blind refers to the fact that specific source signal values and accurate parameter values of a mixing model are not known a priori. Application domains for the material in this paper include communications, biomedical, and sensor array signal processing. Simulations are often needed when the performance of new methods is evaluated. If the method is designed to be blind or robust, simulation studies must cover the whole range of potential random input. It follows that there is a need for advanced tools of data generation. The purpose of this thesis is to introduce a technique for the generation of correlated multivariate random data with non-Gaussian marginal distributions for blind source separation technique.The output random variables are obtained as linear combinations of independent components. The covariance matrix and the first five moments of the output variables may be freely chosen. Moreover, the output variables may be filtered in order to add autocorrelation. The overall system is composed of echo with different sources of sounds, first we separate all these sources using blind source separation then we use our proposed multiple sub adaptive filters approach for cancellation the unwanted sources.","publicationTitle":"2008 Japan-China Joint Workshop on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Japan-China Joint Workshop on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4736493/4736494/04736525.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"180","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Technique of Modeling Acoustic Echo and its Implementation Using FPGA","doi":"10.1109/FCST.2008.37","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4736494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCST.2008.37","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4736525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4736525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New Technique of Modeling Acoustic Echo and its Implementation Using FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10451223","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4736525/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Technique of Modeling Acoustic Echo and its Implementation Using FPGA","confLoc":"Nagasaki, Japan","sourcePdf":"3540a168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064338S","chronDate":"27-28 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4736493","isNumber":"4736494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4736493","xplore-issue":"4736494","articleId":"4736525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4736532,"authors":[{"name":"Hirotomo Hayashi","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirotomo","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37555635000"},{"name":"Qiangfu Zhao","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan"],"firstName":"Qiangfu","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37290792400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3540-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3418-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6301"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-631X"}],"articleNumber":"4736532","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":13},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Neural networks","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","pattern recognition","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network tree","pattern recognition","linear discriminant analysis","dimensionality reduction","dimensional feature space"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine learning","pattern recognition","neural networks","multivariate decision trees"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4736532","doi":"10.1109/FCST.2008.17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCST.2008.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4736494","publicationTitle":"2008 Japan-China Joint Workshop on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Japan-China Joint Workshop on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4736493/4736494/04736532.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"225","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inducing NNTrees Suitable for Hardware Implementation","abstract":"Neural network tree (NNTree) is one of the efficient models for pattern recognition.

After dimensionality reduction, the NNTree can become much more simpler. The question is, can we still get good NNTrees in the lower dimensional feature space? To answer this question, we conducted experiments on several public databases.

The basic principle is to model the effects of the phase noise and multipath channel as an FIR filter in the frequency domain with frequency varying taps. The proposed demodulation scheme iterates between the filter estimation based on tentative decision on the transmitted symbols and symbols estimation with a frequency domain Reduced State Sequence Equalizer (RSSE) based on tentatively estimated filter.

Thus, the problem of speech and audio enhancement is of great importance in speech and audio signal processing. In this paper, a new method for speech enhancement using the harmonic model for voiced frames is proposed. In this method, the fundamental frequency is estimated via the maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) tracking, while the harmonic amplitudes are estimated via the minimum-mean-square error (MMSE) estimator, which utilizes prior statistical information of the speech phonemes.

Many circuit techniques have been successfully applied to reduce both dynamic and leakage components of power. Recently, digital subthreshold circuit design has become a very promising method for ultra-low power applications. Circuits operating in the subthreshold region utilize a supply voltage (VDD) that is close to or even less than the threshold voltages of the transistors. This low VDD operation results in ultra low-power dissipation of the circuit, but significantly increases the circuit\u00bfs propagation delay. In this paper a review of the advantages of the subthreshold circuits compared to the conventional strong inversion circuits is presented. Design challenges in advanced sub-micron technologies are presented through simulation results in 90 nm and 65 nm processes.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2008.4736624","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 25th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 25th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721640/4736539/04736624.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2008.4736624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4736539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital subthreshold logic design - motivation and challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital subthreshold logic design - motivation and challenges","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10442794","publicationDate":"March 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4736624/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4736624/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital subthreshold logic design - motivation and challenges","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049774S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721640","isNumber":"4736539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721640","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4736539","articleId":"4736624","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4736629,"authors":[{"name":"Arie Reichman","affiliation":["Ruppin Academic Center, Israel"],"firstName":"Arie","lastName":"Reichman","id":"37268453900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2481-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2482-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4736629","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":189},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space technology","MIMO","Hardware","Costs","OFDM","Data communication","State estimation","Channel state information","Modulation coding","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","channel capacity","channel coding","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","scheduling","spectral analysis","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi mode multiuser adaptation","MIMO-OFDMA scheme","fourth-generation wireless system","scheduling technique","high spectral efficiency","high link reliability","frequency selective wireless channel capacity","channel state information","adaptive switching algorithm","bit error rate","fixed transmission scheme","modulation-coding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive MIMO","OFDMA"]}],"abstract":"MIMO-OFDM is widely recognized today as a key combination of technologies to achieve high spectral efficiency and high link reliability over space and frequency selective wireless channels, at a reasonable hardware cost.

In this work we formalize the conditions in which capacity of any discrete memoryless channel (DMC) is achieved by multilevel codes with MLC and MSD.

The current analysis aims at studying the P-MIMO potential for a street-canyon scenario and was performed using a P-MIMO 3D channel model based on the ray-tracing technique. It is shown that relative to degenerate polarization-dimension techniques (such as SISO and SIMO) there is a significant capacity improvement when using several polarizations concurrently. Some practical observations are given with respect to the base station antenna orientation and floor-to-walls reflection importance. These results highlight the importance of polarization in MIMO channel models and the potential of P-MIMO implementation in future broadband wireless systems.","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2008.4736633","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 25th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 25th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721640/4736539/04736633.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2008.4736633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4736539","startPage":"741","endPage":"744","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Polarized-mimo capacity analysis in street-canyon using 3D ray-tracing model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4736633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Polarized-mimo capacity analysis in street-canyon using 3D ray-tracing model","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4736633/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10442803","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4736633/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarized-mimo capacity analysis in street-canyon using 3D ray-tracing model","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07083S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721640","isNumber":"4736539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721640","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4736539","articleId":"4736633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4736636,"authors":[{"name":"Itsik Bergel","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Bar-llan University, Israel"],"firstName":"Itsik","lastName":"Bergel","id":"37284754000"},{"name":"Sergio Benedetto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Italy"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Benedetto","id":"37274356800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2481-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2482-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4736636","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Fading","Channel capacity","Signal analysis","H infinity control","Channel estimation","Signal resolution","Knowledge engineering","Performance analysis","Signal design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","fading channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","spread frequency selective fading channels","channel estimation","SNR","effective coherence time"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we derive novel bounds on the capacity of OFDM under spread frequency selective fading channels without prior knowledge of the channel (non-coherent channel).

In this approach a sinusoidal wave is generated by determining the zero crossing of the input voltage. The amplitude and the frequency of this signal are equal to the corresponding those of the input voltage. This signal is used in control of the PFC converter. The performance of the system is analyzed considering the worst cases of input voltage frequency, amplitude and load variation. The hysterisis control mode for continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation is considered in switching control. It is because this is very simple and allows low-distorted input currents and almost unity power factor. Moreover, the ground connected switch simplifies the driver circuit.

Planning and deployment of an OFDMA system requires estimation of system performance in various signal to noise and interference (SINR) conditions. The problem is not trivial as both signal and interference undergo selective fading, and that the signal and interference have partially overlapping spectra. The effect of interference is a function of both its strength and its structure, namely how many of the sub-carriers are affected by it. In this paper we analyze the problem using various link to system mapping techniques. It is shown, by analysis and simulation, that the interference structure has an effect on the effective SINR, however it is small, in Rayleigh fading channels.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance estimation for OFDMA wireless system operating in a selective fading channel with partial interference","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 25th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2008.4736668","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 25th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721640/4736539/04736668.pdf","startPage":"110","endPage":"114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2008.4736668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4736539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4736668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4736668/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance estimation for OFDMA wireless system operating in a selective fading channel with partial interference","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4736668/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10442837","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance estimation for OFDMA wireless system operating in a selective fading channel with partial interference","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.24395S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721640","isNumber":"4736539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721640","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4736539","articleId":"4736668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4736673,"authors":[{"name":"Gill R.

In contradistinction to previous work, we take into account intrinsic properties of the linear power amplifier efficiency - the dependence of power efficiency on clipping ratio. The following tradeoff emerges: a low clipping ratio causes signal distortion and decreases capacity. However, it also increases the efficiency of the power amplifier, which increases capacity. We resolve this tradeoff by evaluating the optimal clipping ratio for achieving maximal capacity. We show that increasing the clipping ratio does not necessarily result in higher capacity. Instead there exists an optimal clipping ratio for given channel SNR. Increasing the clipping ratio beyond optimal significantly reduces capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of linear power amplifier efficiency on capacity of OFDM systems with clipping","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 25th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2008.4736673","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 25th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721640/4736539/04736673.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"136","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EEEI.2008.4736673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4736539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4736673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4736673/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Impact of linear power amplifier efficiency on capacity of OFDM systems with clipping","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4736673/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10442842","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of linear power amplifier efficiency on capacity of OFDM systems with clipping","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055904S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721640","isNumber":"4736539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721640","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4736539","articleId":"4736673","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4736688,"authors":[{"name":"Shmulik Markovich","affiliation":["School Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Shmulik","lastName":"Markovich","id":"37572970400"},{"name":"Sharon Gannot","affiliation":["School Engineering, Bar-llan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Sharon","lastName":"Gannot","id":"37267880400"},{"name":"Israel Cohen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Israel","lastName":"Cohen","id":"37274584400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2481-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2482-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4736688","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Interference cancellation","Working environment noise","Noise cancellation","Microphone arrays","Oral communication","Degradation","Reverberation","Speech enhancement","Acoustic distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","array signal processing","interference suppression","microphone arrays","reverberation","speech enhancement","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference cancelation","noisy environment","reverberant environment","speech communication system","microphone array signal processing","speech signal enhancement","minimum variance distortionless response beamforming","linearly constrained minimum variance beamforming","time-invariant acoustic environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Array signal processing","Speech Enhancement","Subspace methods","Interference cancellation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4736688","doi":"10.1109/EEEI.2008.4736688","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE 25th Convention of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in Israel","abstract":"In speech communication systems the received microphone signals are often degraded by competing speakers, noise signals and room reverberation.

Spherical microphone arrays have the advantage of spherical symmetry facilitating three-dimensional analysis. Performance of microphone arrays at the high-frequency range is typically limited by aliasing, which is a result of the spatial sampling process. A potential approach to avoid spatial aliasing is by using continuous sensors, in which spatial sampling is not required. This paper presents a beamforming technique for a continuous spherical-aperture microphone design.

Detection of clear speech in highly reverberant and noisy enclosures is an extremely difficult problem. In this work we take the approach of spatial filtering by spherical microphone array to overcome noise and reverberation. In order to investigate speech intelligibility, an acoustic model was developed. The model is based on U\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">50</sub>\n, which was shown to have good correlation with speech intelligibility, while combining the effect of both reverberation and noise. This paper presents the array beamforming design for optimal speech intelligibility performance. The beamformer is designed to enhance the speech signal while minimizing noise power and maintaining robustness at a wide frequency range. Having such a model allows the prediction of the required array order for detecting speech clearly.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4736706/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10442875","publicationDate":"March 2008","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4736706/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Study of speech intelligibility in noisy enclosures using optimal spherical beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study of speech intelligibility in noisy enclosures using optimal spherical beamforming","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07947S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721640","isNumber":"4736539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721640","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4736539","articleId":"4736706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4736707,"authors":[{"name":"Moshe Mishali","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Technion, Israel Institute of Technology-Technion, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Moshe","lastName":"Mishali","id":"37393330300"},{"name":"Yonina C.

This strategy relies on the implicit assumption that the individual samplers are exposed to the entire frequency range. This assumption becomes impractical for wideband sparse signals. The current paper proposes an alternative sampling stage that does not require a full-band front end. Instead, signals are captured with an analog front end that consists of a bank of multipliers and lowpass filters whose cutoff is much lower than the Nyquist rate. The problem of recovering the original signal from the low-rate samples can be studied within the framework of compressive sampling. An appropriate parameter selection ensures that the samples uniquely determine the analog input. Moreover, the analog input can be stably reconstructed with digital algorithms. Numerical experiments support the theoretical analysis.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4736707/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4736707/","publicationDate":"March 2008","accessionNumber":"10442876","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Efficient sampling of sparse wideband analog signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient sampling of sparse wideband analog signals","confLoc":"Eilat, Israel","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126181S","chronDate":"3-5 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721640","isNumber":"4736539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721640","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4736539","articleId":"4736707","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4736714,"authors":[{"name":"Anahita Goljahani","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Anahita","lastName":"Goljahani","id":"37660768100"},{"name":"Lorenzo Vangelista","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Lorenzo","lastName":"Vangelista","id":"37347555300"},{"name":"Marco Maso","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Maso","id":"37660767700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2481-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2482-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4736714","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["TV broadcasting","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Interference","Channel estimation","Frequency synchronization","OFDM modulation","Prototypes","Streaming media","Amplitude modulation","Forward error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","digital television","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","pulse shaping","quadrature amplitude modulation","television broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","offset quadrature amplitude modulation","OQAM","digital terrestrial television broadcasting","pulse shaping","intersymbol interference","superimposed sequence","spectral efficiency","channel estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM/OQAM","channel estimation","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing offset quadrature amplitude modulation (OFDM/OQAM) is a multi carrier modulation using staggered transmission on the I and Q axes. It uses as well an optimized non-rectangular pulse shaping. There are several advantages with respect to the conventional OFDM modulation, while the main drawback is the intrinsic intersymbol interference, hindering e.g. a proper channel estimation. In this paper to overcome the effect of the intrinsic interference we propose to estimate the channel through the superimposed correlation-based method. We propose then to exploit the superimposed sequence to achieve time synchronization as well.

This separation of middleware from the visualization components is crucial: it allows us to exploit the strengths of Web service technologies in providing standardized access to the system, and in maintaining state information throughout a session, but also gives us the freedom to build our visualization layer in an efficient and flexible way without the constraints of Web service protocols.

Our objective is to expedite this process by employing Google's MapReduce framework to implement scale-out distributed querying and reasoning. This approach requires RDF graphs to be decomposed into smaller units that are distributed across computational nodes. RDF Molecules appear to offer an ideal approach - providing an intermediate level of granularity between RDF graphs and triples. However, the original RDF molecule definition has inherent limitations that will adversely affect performance. In this paper, we propose a number of extensions to RDF molecules (hierarchy and ordering) to overcome these limitations. We then present some implementation details for our MapReduce-based RDF molecule store. Finally we evaluate the benefits of our approach in the context of the Bio-MANTA project - an application that requires integration and querying across large-scale protein-protein interaction datasets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4736747/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-12 Dec. 2008","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-12 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4736747/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10451235","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Scalable Semantics \u2013 The Silver Lining of Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scalable Semantics \u2013 The Silver Lining of Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"3535a111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065984S","chronDate":"7-12 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4736721","isNumber":"4736722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4736721","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4736722","articleId":"4736747","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4736748,"authors":[{"name":"Lifeng Ai","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Australia"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"Ai","id":"37647859900"},{"name":"Maolin Tang","affiliation":["Queensland University of Technology, Australia"],"firstName":"Maolin","lastName":"Tang","id":"37276097900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3380-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3535-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4736748","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4736748","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Genetic algorithms","Constraint optimization","Context-aware services","Concrete","Data visualization","Scalability","Service oriented architecture","Global Positioning System","Australia"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","quality of service","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS-based Web service composition","inter-service dependencies","minimal-conflict hill-climbing repair genetic algorithm","semantic grid","context constraints","Web service composition optimization problem"]}],"doi":"10.1109/eScience.2008.110","pdfPath":"/iel5/4736721/4736722/04736748.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Fourth International Conference on eScience","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Fourth International Conference on eScience","startPage":"119","endPage":"126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4736722","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/eScience.2008.110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Based Web Service Composition Accommodating Inter-service Dependencies Using Minimal-Conflict Hill-Climbing Repair Genetic Algorithm","abstract":"In the field of semantic grid, QoS-based Web service composition is an important problem. In semantic and service rich environment like semantic grid, the emergence of context constraints on Web services is very common making the composition consider not only QoS properties of Web services, but also inter service dependencies and conflicts which are formed due to the context constraints imposed on Web services. In this paper, we present a repair genetic algorithm, namely minimal-conflict hill-climbing repair genetic algorithm, to address the Web service composition optimization problem in the presence of domain constraints and inter service dependencies and conflicts.

This model is called MRPGA (MapReduce for parallel GAs), which can automatically parallelize GAs. We describe the design and implementation of the extended MapReduce model on a .NET-based enterprise grid system in detail.

Although there are many evaluations of the MapReduce technique using large textual data collections, there have been only a few evaluations for scientific data analyses. The goals of this paper are twofold. First, we present our experience in applying the MapReduce technique for two scientific data analyses: (i) high energy physics data analyses; (ii) K-means clustering.

It is crucial to identify and optimize the most significant statistics representing insolation availability by a solar PV installation for all necessary engineering and financial calculation. A MATLAB program has been used to build the annual frequency distribution of hourly insolation over any module plane at a given site location. Descriptive statistical analysis of such distributions is done through MINITAB. To make the analysis more meaningful, composite frequency distribution for a Building Integrated Photo Voltaic (BIPV) set up has been considered, which is formed by weighted summation of insolation distributions for different module planes used in the installation. The most influential statistics of the composite distribution have been optimized through Artificial Neural Network Computation.

To overcome frequency selective fading of wireless channels and improve capacity of the system, OFDM system using space-time block coding (STBC) is considered.

In this paper, we present a scatter search algorithm for predicting 3D structures of proteins based on torsion angles representation. Given the protein\u00bfs sequence of amino acids, our algorithm produces a 3D structure that aims to minimize the energy function associated with the structure. Scatter search is an evolutionary approach that is based on a population of candidate solutions. We evaluate our algorithm on proteins taken from a protein data bank. The results show that our algorithm is able to produce 3D structures with good sub-optimal energy values. Also, the root mean square deviations of these structures from the reference proteins are promising within limits imposed by the assumptions made.","doi":"10.1109/ICACTE.2008.130","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/4736903/4736904/04737092.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4736904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACTE.2008.130","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering","startPage":"925","endPage":"929","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary Algorithm for Protein Structure Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Algorithm for Protein Structure Prediction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737092/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737092/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10444051","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary Algorithm for Protein Structure Prediction","confLoc":"Phuket, Thailand","sourcePdf":"3489a925.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037053S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4736903","isNumber":"4736904","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4736903","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4736904","articleId":"4737092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4737100,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochang Zheng","affiliation":["Computer Centre, Zhangzhou Normal University, Zhangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37652449300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3489-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-7491"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-7505"}],"articleNumber":"4737100","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":38},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737100","abstract":"The stability of neural networks is the foundation of the neural networks in various applications.

The simulation results show that the power efficiency of the proposed algorithm increases greatly over that of the MaxRt+WF (maximal marginal rate subcarrier and waterfilling power allocation) and MaxFA+WF (fixed subcarrier allocation and waterfilling power allocation).","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737150.pdf","startPage":"92","endPage":"97","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation based on power efficiency in uplink OFDMA systems: A game theoretic approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Game theory","Pricing","OFDM","Resource management","Nash equilibrium","Downlink","Interference constraints","Power system modeling","Power engineering and energy","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","game theory","OFDM modulation","Pareto analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power efficiency","game theoretic approach","joint power and subcarrier allocation scheme","single-cell uplink OFDMA system","peak power constraint","Nash equilibrium","Pareto improvement","far-near effect","waterfilling power allocation","maximal marginal rate subcarrier","fixed subcarrier allocation","orthogonal frequency division modulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","uplink","resource allocation","non-cooperative game theory","pricing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power allocation based on power efficiency in uplink OFDMA systems: A game theoretic approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737150/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442905","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation based on power efficiency in uplink OFDMA systems: A game theoretic approach","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050395S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4737151,"authors":[{"name":"Guopeng Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Guopeng Zhang","id":"37715973200"},{"name":"Hailin Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Hailin Zhang","id":"37293132300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737151","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":390},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","Game theory","Bit error rate","Nonlinear equations","Laboratories","Intserv networks","Throughput","Signal to noise ratio","Frequency conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative systems","error statistics","frequency division multiple access","game theory","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resource allocation","downlink OFDMA networks","cooperative game theory","wireless networks","Nash bargaining solution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","resource allocation","cooperative game","Nash bargaining solution","QoS"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a cooperative game theoretic resource allocation scheme for downlink OFDMA wireless networks. We define a user\u00bfs payoff as a function of his data throughput. Then the source allocation can be modeled as a cooperative game to maximize the aggregate payoff of the users. To achieve the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) of the game, a suboptimal subcarrier allocation is first performed by assuming an equal power allocation. An optimal power allocation algorithm then maximizes the sum payoff while ensuring QoS demand (the minimum data throughputs) of the users. Through comparing with the other two resource allocation algorithms, i.e., the maximizing system capacity and the max-min fairness algorithm, simulation results show that the cooperative game acquired a good tradeoff between the fairness and the overall system capacity. The user\u00bfs QoS demand is ensured, and the system resource is utilized efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737151","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737151.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","startPage":"98","endPage":"103","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adapative resource allocation for downlink OFDMA networks using cooperative game theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adapative resource allocation for downlink OFDMA networks using cooperative game theory","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737151/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442906","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4737151/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adapative resource allocation for downlink OFDMA networks using cooperative game theory","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068429S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4737152,"authors":[{"name":"Shufang Lin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China","Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding & Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Shufang Lin","id":"37653676600"},{"name":"Xuming Fang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of ISN, Xidian University, Xi'an, China","Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Coding & Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Xuming Fang","id":"37290931500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737152","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Bandwidth","Game theory","Convergence","Interference","Temperature","Costs","Chromium","Traffic control","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio networks","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","spectrum lease framework","distributed two-level game","PU-level game","SU-level game","primary users","second users","optimal price"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","two-level game","spectrum lease"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737152","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737152","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","abstract":"In this paper we propose a distributed two-level game composed of a PU-level game and a SU-level game to model the spectrum lease between primary users (PUs) and second users (SUs) in cognitive radio (CR) networks.

The resulted OFDM system is called non-contiguous OFDM (NC-OFDM) system. For NC-OFDM systems, as no pilot symbols can be transmitted over these deactivated subcarriers, the conventional modified least square channel estimation can not be applied. In this paper, we propose a new channel estimation method to address this issue. In the proposed channel estimation, we use the LS channel estimation to obtain the channel fading coefficients associated with the subcarriers over which the pilot symbols are transmitted. Furthermore, we compute the time domain channel pulse response based on the basic principle of Fourier transform. Then, we adopt inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) based channel estimation noise reduction to improve the channel estimation accuracy. For slow time-varying channel, we also propose to use pilot-block average based channel estimation noise reduction to further improve the channel estimation performance.

In this paper, a singular value decomposition (SVD)-based approach is presented to sense and estimate a WM signal. After performing SVD on the received data matrix, the presence of a WM signal can be detected and then the center frequency of a WM signal can be estimated. By doing so, a guard bandwidth is retained such that the other spectrum in this sensing band is still available for the secondary users and the spectrum efficiency can be improved.

To coexist with the primary user in the same frequency band, the secondary user has to adopt strict interference control rules to avoid interference towards primary users. This paper proposes using interference time ratio (ITR) (i.e. the fraction of a primary user\u00bfs burst that is interfered by secondary transmission) as a measure of how much the primary user is impacted by secondary user for OSA system. A scheme based on multi-step-ahead prediction is proposed to predict the ITR and control the ITR so that it does not exceed a predefined threshold. To further illustrate the proposed interference avoidance scheme, two cases with different primary user traffic model are studied and simulated. The simulation and analysis results show that within acceptable predicting step number, primary user\u00bfs burst could be well protected and precise ITR control could be achieved through the proposed interference avoidance scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737177/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10442932","htmlLink":"/document/4737177/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Interference avoidance based on multi-step-ahead prediction for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference avoidance based on multi-step-ahead prediction for cognitive radio","confLoc":"Guangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059741S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737177","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4737178,"authors":[{"name":"Wanjun Zhi","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Wanjun Zhi","id":"37268144000"},{"name":"Ying-Chang Liang","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"lastName":"Ying-Chang Liang","id":"37275171800"},{"name":"Michael Yan Wah Chia","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Agency for Science, Technology and Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Michael Yan Wah","lastName":"Chia","id":"37278714100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737178","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Array signal processing","Cognitive radio","Interference","Receivers","Channel state information","Radio transmitters","Signal design","Protection","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cognitive radio","receivers","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","transmit beamforming","convex optimization theory","channel state information","CSI","secondary user","primary user"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the design of robust transmit beamforming for the secondary user (SU) when it co-exists with the primary user (PU) in a cognitive radio network, and the SU\u00bfs transmitter (SU-Tx) is equipped with multiple antennas.

By formulating the problem as maximizing the transmission power to the desired SU receiver (SU-Rx) as well as limiting the interference to the PU in a robust manner, the optimal transmit beamforming is designed using convex optimization theory.

By designing a joint detection (JD) structure for consecutive symbol vectors in the same transmit burst, more a priori information is exploited when updating the estimated posterior marginal probabilities for each symbol per iteration. Therefore the proposed PDA detector (denoted as PDA-JD detector) outperforms the conventional PDA detectors in the context of correlated input bit streams. Moreover, the conventional PDA detectors are shown to be a special case of the PDA-JD detector. Simulations and analyses are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737221","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737221.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","startPage":"436","endPage":"440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic data association based MIMO detector using joint detection of consecutive symbol vectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic data association based MIMO detector using joint detection of consecutive symbol vectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737221/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442976","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4737221/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic data association based MIMO detector using joint detection of consecutive symbol vectors","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00090.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054998S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4737222,"authors":[{"name":"Jinhuan Xia","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jinhuan Xia","id":"37087396164"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Tiejun Lv","id":"37087179297"},{"name":"Xiang Yun","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiang Yun","id":"37087397287"},{"name":"Xinghui Su","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xinghui Su","id":"37087396224"},{"name":"Shaoshi Yang","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shaoshi Yang","id":"37087397067"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737222","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Simulated annealing","Multiuser detection","Multiaccess communication","Cooling","MIMO","Genetic mutations","Interference cancellation","OFDM","Bit error rate","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","genetic algorithms","maximum likelihood estimation","multiuser detection","simulated annealing","space division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","multiuser detection","synchronous SDMA system","synchronous space division multiple access system","experiential cooling schedule","Markov chain","uniform mutation based trial vector generation scheme","genetic algorithm","maximum likelihood MUD"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737222","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737222.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulated Annealing based multiuser detection for synchronous SDMA system","abstract":"In this treatise, a novel Simulated Annealing (SA) based Multi-User Detection (MUD) is proposed in synchronous Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) system.

In addition, the optimal solution recording scheme is also invoked in case of being lost during cooling process.

To choose proper oversample rate, the relation between OIMS\u00bf performance and adopted rates is analyzed via merit factor function of auto-correlation, mean-square cross-correlation (MSCC) function and balance degree. Obtained statistic results verify that with higher security level, OIMS possess much better correlation property and balance property than former IM sequences. Furthermore, an optimal filter strategy in 2D-CDMA is proposed for best selection of complex spreading sequences including IM sequences and OIMS. Under a variety of channel conditions, simulation results show that the bit-error rate performance of OIMS is anyway more desirable than that of IM sequences in the 2D-CDMA system and that of gold sequences in conventional CDMA system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel hyperchaotic spreading code and its application to 2D-CDMA","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737225","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737225.pdf","startPage":"456","endPage":"460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737225","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel hyperchaotic spreading code and its application to 2D-CDMA","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737225/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442980","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel hyperchaotic spreading code and its application to 2D-CDMA","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050468S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4737226,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Fa Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chao Yang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yung-Fa","lastName":"Huang","id":"37335701600"},{"name":"Ding Yin","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Chao Yang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Yin","id":"37646949100"},{"name":"Tan-Hsu Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tan-Hsu","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274123600"},{"name":"Wei-Cheng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Cheng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37650345800"},{"name":"Neng-Chung Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Information Engineering, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Neng-Chung","lastName":"Wang","id":"37653192400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737226","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Multiaccess communication","Genetic mutations","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Genetic algorithms","Multiuser detection","Biological cells","Genetic engineering","Computational complexity","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","genetic algorithms","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicarrier CDMA communication systems","forcing mutation evolutionary multiuser detector","genetic algorithm","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MC-CDMA","multiuser detection","Genetic algorithm","forcing mutation evolutionary"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a forcing mutation scheme from GA to perform a forcing mutation evolutionary multiuser detector (FME-MUD) and to largely reduce computational complexity.

In this paper, multi-scale entropy (MSE) and Renyi cross entropy are introduced to solve these problems. First, a kind of Port-to-Port traffic termed IF-flow in router is defined. Internal traffic matrix can be constructed by IF-flows. Then a new scheme based on MSE and Renyi cross entropy is proposed to detect traffic anomaly existed in IF-flow matrix. MSE is used to detect IF-flow traces in time scales. Renyi cross entropy is used to detect anomaly existed in IF-flow matrix in space and small scale time, and pinpoint IF-flow(s) responsible for entropy change. An improved method to calculate Renyi cross entropy is proposed to reduce false alarm and identify anomaly duration. The experimental results indicate the scheme can detect anomaly accurately in time and space.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-scale entropy and renyi cross entropy based traffic anomaly detection","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737245","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737245.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737245","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737245/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-scale entropy and renyi cross entropy based traffic anomaly detection","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737245/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443000","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-scale entropy and renyi cross entropy based traffic anomaly detection","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046331S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737245","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4737263,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37635674700"},{"name":"Laurie Cuthbert","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK","Department of Electronic Engineering Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Laurie","lastName":"Cuthbert","id":"37279686900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737263","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Relays","Power system relaying","OFDM","Data engineering","Regeneration engineering","Power engineering and energy","Base stations","Throughput","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","energy conservation","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","radio links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive power allocation scheme","energy efficiency","OFDMA relay network","two-hop power allocation","base station","relay station","transmission power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","relay","power allocation","data rate balance"]}],"abstract":"An adaptive power allocation algorithm called two-hop power allocation (THPA) is proposed to guarantee two-hop data rate balance in regenerative OFDM relay systems.

The transmission power on the link with the larger data rate will be reduced while the transmission power on the other link remaining the same.

However, an OFDM signal has a large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which will cause serious nonlinear distortion especially when the signal passes through a nonlinear system. Adaptive symbol selection scheme (ASSS) is used to reduce the unwanted PAPR by selecting the adaptive OFDM signal with the smallest PAPR before transmitting. Because of the side information needed in ASSS, the effective data rate finally got in the receiver decreases. We develop a new modulation method using ASSS and channel estimation together, which can transmit the needed side information in the pilot tones made by channel estimation during the signal transmission. Our simulation results show that the method we proposed is a promising and valuable technique for reducing PAPR in OFDM signals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737264.pdf","startPage":"642","endPage":"646","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737264","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737264","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737264","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission of side information using pilot tones for OFDM systems over fading channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Peak to average power ratio","Channel estimation","OFDM modulation","Sampling methods","Wireless communication","Nonlinear distortion","Interleaved codes","Power engineering computing","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","channel estimation","fading channels","nonlinear distortion","nonlinear systems","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot tones","OFDM systems","fading channels","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless communications","peak-to-average power ratio","nonlinear distortion","nonlinear system","adaptive symbol selection scheme","adaptive OFDM signal","modulation method","channel estimation","signal transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Symbol Selection Scheme","Side information","Channel Estimation","Pilot tones","Fading channels"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737264/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Transmission of side information using pilot tones for OFDM systems over fading channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737264/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443019","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission of side information using pilot tones for OFDM systems over fading channels","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065014S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4737265,"authors":[{"name":"Kyongkuk Cho","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Eng, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyongkuk","lastName":"Cho","id":"37291748400"},{"name":"Jaeyoon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Eng, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jaeyoon","lastName":"Lee","id":"37656547800"},{"name":"Dongweon Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Eng, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongweon","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37266960200"},{"name":"Sang Kyu Park","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Eng, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Kyu","lastName":"Park","id":"37280888900"},{"name":"Sanggoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Eng, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sanggoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37537397800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737265","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"abstract":"In an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, in-phase and quadrature (I/Q) imbalances generated in the analog front-end introduce inter-channel interference (ICI) and, consequently, error performance degradation.

The simulation result demonstrates that the cell-edge peak bit rate increases 7% with the proposed hybrid method.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737267","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","startPage":"656","endPage":"660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid inter-cell interference mitigation scheme for OFDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid inter-cell interference mitigation scheme for OFDMA system","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737267/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443022","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4737267/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid inter-cell interference mitigation scheme for OFDMA system","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031882S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4737268,"authors":[{"name":"Qicun Shi","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qicun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37533826000"},{"name":"Zhixing Yang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhixing","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280277800"},{"name":"Lifeng He","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lifeng","lastName":"He","id":"37395565000"},{"name":"Kewu Peng","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kewu","lastName":"Peng","id":"37274592000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737268","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":882},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","OFDM","Frequency synchronization","Frequency diversity","Sampling methods","Signal to noise ratio","AWGN","Frequency conversion","Performance gain","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel estimation","frequency hop communication","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all digital baseband frequency hopping OFDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","sampling rate conversion","frequency hopping gain","fixed carrier frequency OFDM","frequency diversity gain","analog frequency hopping OFDM","superimposed sequence","channel estimation","SNR loss","FH pattern acquisition","frame synchronization","SER performance","additive white Gaussian noise channels","multipath channels","power ratio","AWGN channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","frequency hopping","synchronization","superimposed training"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an all digital baseband frequency-hopping orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system based on sampling rate conversion has been proposed. By changing the ratio of sampling rate conversion, the frequency hopping (FH) gain can be configured easily. Comparing with the conventional fixed carrier frequency OFDM, this system can achieve frequency diversity gain; while comparing with the analog frequency hopping OFDM (FH-OFDM) emerging recently, our proposed system has more flexibility, lower complexity, and better acquisition and synchronization performance for digital receiver. Superimposed sequence has been employed as the training sequence for synchronization and channel estimation, unlike preamble sequence inserted in time domain and pilot subcarriers inserted in frequency domain, this scheme can improve spectrum efficiency at the cost of a little bit SNR loss, moreover, it can perform joint FH pattern acquisition and frame synchronization for the proposed system simultaneously. Simulation results show that the proposed system has better performance than non-FH system, and achieves good SER performance over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels as well as multipath channels. The power ratio of superimposed signal to information signal provides a way of trade-off between SNR loss and synchronization performance. Changing the power ratio also affects the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737268","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737268.pdf","startPage":"661","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737268","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"All digital baseband frequency hopping OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737268","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737268/","displayDocTitle":"All digital baseband frequency hopping OFDM system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443023","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737268/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"All digital baseband frequency hopping OFDM system","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048575S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737268","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4737273,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Ying","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhao Ying","id":"37287148500"},{"name":"Xiao Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Information Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Xiao Yang","id":"37289759800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737273","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel space-time fast frequency hopping (FFH) multiple input multiple output (MIMO) wireless communication system over rayleigh fading channel.

We consider transmit antenna correlation and use an accurate capacity lower bound to carry out the theoretical analysis for MIMO systems with and without covariance feedback. We show that for non-feedback systems, the capacity increases with channel correlation at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This finding is in contrast to the existing result for non-feedback systems with perfect channel estimation. For covariance feedback systems, we find that the capacity increases with correlation. We also show the robustness of equal power transmission and the optimality of beamforming at low SNR for non-feedback and covariance feedback systems, respectively. Our numerical results validate our analysis and show that the theoretical low SNR analysis can extend to moderate SNR values.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737299","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737299.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","startPage":"817","endPage":"822","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of MIMO systems: Impact of spatial correlation with channel estimation errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of MIMO systems: Impact of spatial correlation with channel estimation errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737299/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443054","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4737299/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of MIMO systems: Impact of spatial correlation with channel estimation errors","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074511S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4737300,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoting Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China","Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications Technology, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoting Wang","id":"37657513200"},{"name":"Wenbo Wang","affiliation":["Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communication, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Wenbo Wang","id":"37280459100"},{"name":"Tianlin Zhu","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications Technology, China"],"lastName":"Tianlin Zhu","id":"37653623700"},{"name":"Zongyin Zhao","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Tracking and Telecommunications Technology, China"],"lastName":"Zongyin Zhao","id":"37656024500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737300","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":310},"abstract":"This paper investigates the spatial multiuser scheduling strategies that apply different pairing criteria to select a pair of users carrying out transmission simultaneously in virtual MIMO (VMIMO) systems.

The system throughput and user fairness are simulated and analyzed. As the results show, the proposed criteria can make full use of channel state information provided by the physical layer and can be compatible with different antenna deployments, and in addition, through obtaining more spatial diversity gain and multiuser diversity gain, the VMIMO system with spatial pairing scheduling approaches remarkably improve the system performance comparing to the MIMO system with single user scheduling.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737300.pdf","startPage":"823","endPage":"827","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial multiuser pairing scheduling strategies for virtual MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Diversity methods","Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Throughput","Receiving antennas","Wireless communication","Base stations","Scheduling algorithm","Minimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","MIMO communication","scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial multiuser pairing scheduling strategies","virtual MIMO systems","channel correlation minimization","bit error rate minimization","capacity maximization","channel state information","physical layer","spatial diversity gain","multiuser diversity gain","single user scheduling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Spatial multiuser pairing scheduling strategies for virtual MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737300/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443055","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial multiuser pairing scheduling strategies for virtual MIMO systems","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049735S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4737302,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanjun Jiang","affiliation":["National Mobil Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, China","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhanjun Jiang","id":"37087301872"},{"name":"Dongming Wang","affiliation":["National Mobil Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Dongming Wang","id":"37087151452"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["National Mobil Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yan Wang","id":"37087191792"},{"name":"Xiaohu You","affiliation":["National Mobil Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiaohu You","id":"37087150237"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737302","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737302","abstract":"Transmit diversity (TD) is an efficient method to yield channel capacity in single-user multi-antenna system. In this paper, we first analyze scheduling based on TD in multi-user distributed antenna systems (DAS). We show that average throughput of the system grows with the total number of remote access units (RAUs) in DAS. However, when the total number of RAUs is constant, TD has little improvement to average throughput. Then, parallel multiplexing scheduling (PMS) is proposed based on multi-user multiplexing in spatial domain to improve average throughput of DAS. In PMS, multiple users are selected to transmit simultaneously at each slot rather than only one user occupies all channel resources in scheduling based on TD. Thus PMS achieves a better performance than scheduling based on TD does. Finally, an optimized PMS (OPMS) scheme is presented, in which all users are classified as multiple scheduling user groups (SUGs), and then parallel scheduling is implemented among the SUGs. OPMS inherits all characteristics of PMS but only partial channel state information (CSI) is fed back to base station (BS).","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","startPage":"831","endPage":"835","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737302.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel multiplexing scheduling in DAS with partial channel state information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","Throughput","MIMO","Scheduling","Base stations","Wireless communication","Optical fiber networks","Optical scattering","Optical fiber cables","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","diversity reception","multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel multiplexing scheduling","DAS","partial channel state information","transmit diversity","channel capacity","single-user multi-antenna system","multi-user distributed antenna systems","multi-user multiplexing","optimized PMS scheme"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Parallel multiplexing scheduling in DAS with partial channel state information","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737302/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737302/","accessionNumber":"10443057","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel multiplexing scheduling in DAS with partial channel state information","confLoc":"Guangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104245S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737302","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4737303,"authors":[{"name":"Jisheng Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Jisheng Dai","id":"37574303200"},{"name":"Zhongfu Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology, Hefei, China"],"lastName":"Zhongfu Ye","id":"37287656600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737303","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transceivers","Symmetric matrices","Decoding","Estimation error","Information rates","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Bit error rate","Design engineering","Power engineering and energy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","MIMO communication","optimisation","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear transceivers","MIMO transceivers","lp-norm power constraint","symbol estimation errors","optimization problem","precoder matrices","decoder matrices","directional derivative method","power allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, linear MIMO transceivers design for minimizing the combination of symbol estimation errors subject to l\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-norm constraint is investigated.

However, the envelope of FQPSK still has a least fluctuation of 0.18 dB and can be further improved. New waveforms for FQPSK modulation are presented in this paper. The performance of the FQPSK adopting new waveform is justified by analysis and simulation. The signal of new FQPSK has the strictly constant envelope. It improves the power efficiency of the amplifiers to the utmost, and outperforms over conventional FQPSK in both the bandwidth efficiency and the end to end performance of bit error probability. At last, the impact of frequency selective multi-path fading on the bit error rate performance of new FQPSK is derived and analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737306","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737306.pdf","startPage":"851","endPage":"854","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel waveform for FQPSK modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737306","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737306/","displayDocTitle":"A novel waveform for FQPSK modulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443061","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737306/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel waveform for FQPSK modulation","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049443S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4737315,"authors":[{"name":"Feijin Shi","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Feijin","lastName":"Shi","id":"37652262600"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737315","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":219},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","Diversity reception","Automatic repeat request","Physical layer","Protocols","Fading","Decoding","Modulation coding","Relays","Cross layer design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","adaptive modulation","automatic repeat request"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative HARQ","cross-layer combination","wireless ad-hoc networks","adaptive modulation and coding","hybrid automatic repeat request","data link layer","packet error rate","spectral efficiency","cooperative transmission scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive modulation and coding (AMC)","cross-layer design","cooperative diversity","hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ)","wireless Ad-hoc network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737315","abstract":"This paper proposes a cross-layer design which combines adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), cooperative diversity at physical layer (PHY) and hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) at data link layer (LL) for wireless ad-hoc networks.

Then we propose a novel hybrid transmission scheme which invokes cooperation based on the feedback AMC information. Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of the hybrid transmission scheme is equivalent to the cooperative transmission scheme while its cooperation cost is kept much lower compared with that of the cooperative transmission scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737315","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737315","startPage":"896","endPage":"900","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737315.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-layer combination of cooperative HARQ with AMC in wireless ad-hoc networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer combination of cooperative HARQ with AMC in wireless ad-hoc networks","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737315/","accessionNumber":"10443070","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737315/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer combination of cooperative HARQ with AMC in wireless ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00184.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034065S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4737329,"authors":[{"name":"Pedro C.

Previous techniques consume enormous amounts of time due to pre-processing features (unsupervised anomaly detection), or due to the lead time in creating specialized rules (supervised anomaly detection). The system described in this paper, MCAD, uses the observed premise that anomalous connections by one attacker are very similar to each other (e.g. an attacker will try to use similar connections to probe a network). MCAD tests for similarity amongst connections within clustered groups, and if the similarity for connections of the group is above a predetermined threshold, then these connections are deemed anomalous. MCAD was tested on two weeks of MIT/LL DARPA dataset. The total number connections tested was over a million. From this testing, MCAD was able to detect 15 types of multiple connection based attacks in which 14 types of attacks were fully detected while the 15th attack was detected 2/3 of the time.

However, spectrum mobility and spectrum handoff are new challenges for cognitive wireless networks. Little research addresses these fields now. In this paper, we discuss concepts of spectrum mobility/handoff and research probability models of spectrum holes and cognitive user\u00bfs behavior. A time relationship model of spectrum handoff is proposed. We also research the impact of spectrum mobility and service duration of cognitive user on spectrum handoff probability.

As one of these approaches, partial transmit sequence (PTS) is effective and uncomplicated. This paper presents a novel PTS architecture for PAPR reduction of OFDM Signals, and the architecture can implement FFT/IFFT operation and control the PAPR of the transmit signal. Because of the delay feedback and the data scheduling approaches in IFFT architecture, the hardware costs of the memories, complex multipliers, complex adders, and ROM respectively are reduced by 75.6%, 44.0%, 28.6%, and 75.0% compared to the R23SDF multiple processor approach. Moreover, the operation time of IFFT is reduced by 75% compared to the grouping approach by reordering the frequency-domain sequences. Additionally, the number of operated candidates can be reduced from 64 to 16 through searching effective phase factors.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737344.pdf","startPage":"1055","endPage":"1060","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737344","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737344","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel PTS architecture for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","OFDM","Partial transmit sequences","Wireless communication","Delay","Feedback","Processor scheduling","Hardware","Costs","Read only memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","fast Fourier transforms","feedback","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partial transmit sequence architecture","OFDM signals","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","wireless communication","peak-to-average power ratio","fast Fourier transforms","delay feedback","data scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","partial transmit sequence (PTS)","fast Fourier transform (FFT)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737344/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel PTS architecture for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737344/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443099","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel PTS architecture for PAPR reduction of OFDM signals","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047237S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737344","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4737346,"authors":[{"name":"Osamu Muta","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science and Electrical Engineering, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Muta","id":"37293729800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737346","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","OFDM","Peak to average power ratio","Decoding","Phase control","Turbo codes","Estimation error","Error correction","Error analysis","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","error correction","fading","modulation coding","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","space division multiplexing","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier-phase control","peak power reduction method","turbo-coded space division multiplex","partial-transmit sequence method","error correction","weighting factors estimation","decoding","SDM-OFDM systems","64-QAM OFDM signal","block error rate","Rayleigh fading","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","PAPR reduction","Turbo-code","Space division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a sub-carrier phase control based peak power reduction (PPR) method for a turbo-coded space division multiplexed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (SDM-OFDM) system.

Recently a PAPR reduction scheme called the metric based amplitude predistortion (MBAP) with low complexity has been proposed. In this paper, we propose a phase reversal scheme which uses the same metric as in the MBAP scheme to reduce PAPR. The proposed scheme utilizes the metric to determine some input symbols to reverse their phases by 180 degrees to achieve PAPR reduction without increasing the input power. In addition, we develop a combination scheme which appropriately combines the phase reversal scheme with the conventional partial transmit sequence (PTS) scheme. Simulation results indicate that the proposed phase reversal scheme and combination scheme can effectively improve the performance of the MBAP and PTS schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737347","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737347.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","startPage":"1071","endPage":"1075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM peak power reduction using phase reversal and combination with PTS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDM peak power reduction using phase reversal and combination with PTS","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737347/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443102","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4737347/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM peak power reduction using phase reversal and combination with PTS","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038338S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4737348,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We find that the prerequisites of most previous studies are using an equal spaced pilots pattern and sample-spaced channels. This is not the case in practical systems. According to conventional pilot-assisted estimators, we develop an improved channel estimation method based on the criteria of least square (LS) for IEEE 802.16e OFDM systems. In this practical system, pilots are not evenly inserted in the frequency band and the non-sample-spaced multipath delay leads to channel impulse response (CIR) leakage in the time domain. The proposed uneven pilot-assisted CE method is conducted in the frequency domain and it uses a linear model to approximate the time-varying characteristic of CIR in the frequency domain during each OFDM symbol. Analysis and simulations demonstrate its low computational complexity, good performance and practicability in actual OFDM systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737348.pdf","startPage":"1076","endPage":"1080","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737348","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uneven pilot-assisted channel estimation method for mobile OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Least squares approximation","Frequency domain analysis","Delay effects","Linear approximation","Performance analysis","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","computational complexity","frequency-domain analysis","least squares approximations","mobile radio","OFDM modulation","time-domain analysis","transient response","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uneven pilot-assisted channel estimation method","mobile OFDM systems","equal spaced pilots pattern","sample-spaced channels","least square","IEEE 802.16e OFDM systems","nonsample-spaced multipath delay","channel impulse response leakage","time domain","frequency domain","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel estimation","uneven pilot","LS","linear model","time-varying channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737348/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Uneven pilot-assisted channel estimation method for mobile OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737348/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443103","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uneven pilot-assisted channel estimation method for mobile OFDM systems","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06673S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4737349,"authors":[{"name":"Yinghua Li","affiliation":["State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yinghua Li","id":"37656173900"},{"name":"Yongjun Deng","affiliation":["System Engineering Research Institute, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Yongjun Deng","id":"37656527200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737349","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel state information","Satellite communication","Nonlinear distortion","Decision feedback equalizers","Neural networks","Artificial satellites","AWGN","Monitoring","Systems engineering and theory","Recurrent neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","decision making","intersymbol interference","Kalman filters","recurrent neural nets","satellite communication","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite communication","nonlinear equalization algorithm","channel state information","extended Kalman filter","decision feedback equalization","complex bilinear recurrent neural network","stop-and-go algorithm","intersymbol interference","ISI"]}],"abstract":"Three nonlinear equalization algorithms are discussed for the case that training sequence is not available but channel state information (CSI) is known.

Accurate estimation of channel impulse response (CIR) is difficult but very important to recover transmitted OFDM symbols by subtracting padded PN sequences. Conventional channel estimation methods only use PN sequences as the training sequences to obtain CIR. Actually, decision-directed channel estimation (DDCE) method which takes advantage of the fact that M-QAM modulated subcarriers in OFDM symbol also contain much valuable hidden-information due to regular constellation mapping and can be used to improve the accuracy of channel estimation. In this paper, the accuracy of channel estimation based on both PN sequence and OFDM symbol is investigated. Moreover, a novel DDCE method based on an accurate initial CIR obtained from two consecutive training sequence and partial decision results of OFDM subcarriers for TDS-OFDM system is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm works well over the slow-varying frequency-selective fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737352","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","startPage":"1096","endPage":"1100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel decision-directed channel estimation method for TDS-OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel decision-directed channel estimation method for TDS-OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737352/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443107","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4737352/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel decision-directed channel estimation method for TDS-OFDM system","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129687S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4737353,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Fazle Rabbi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mohammad Fazle","lastName":"Rabbi","id":"37658071200"},{"name":"Shengwei Hou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Shengwei Hou","id":"37651277500"},{"name":"C.

After formulating a BEM-based signal model for OFDMA uplink transmission over time and frequency selective fading channels, we develop a pilot-aided channel estimation scheme for user channel information tracking in the time domain. specifically, a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) and a least square (LS) estimator have been investigated for channel estimation under the help of time-domain pilots. In particular, the proposed pilot based estimation scheme does not require a whole OFDMA block of pilot to estimate channel. Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for LS (LS-T) and the MSE lower bound for LMMSE (LMMSE-T) estimator have been derived. It is shown that in very high Doppler spread scenario, LS-T estimator performs as the optimal unbiased estimator and chases the CRLB, while LMMSE-T minimizes the overall MSE and gains more improvement over unbiased estimator. Simulation results are presented to show the performance improvement that can be achieved by the proposed estimation algorithm over current notable schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737353","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737353.pdf","startPage":"1101","endPage":"1105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Basis Expansion Model (BEM) based channel estimation for OFDMA Uplink transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737353/","displayDocTitle":"Basis Expansion Model (BEM) based channel estimation for OFDMA Uplink transmission","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443108","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737353/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basis Expansion Model (BEM) based channel estimation for OFDMA Uplink transmission","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053027S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4737354,"authors":[{"name":"Hiromichi Tomeba","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiromichi","lastName":"Tomeba","id":"37294909200"},{"name":"Kazuki Takeda","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuki","lastName":"Takeda","id":"37395678500"},{"name":"Kazuaki Takeda","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuaki","lastName":"Takeda","id":"37269966100"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Communication Engineering, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737354","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737354","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Bit error rate","Downlink","Frequency","Mobile communication","Computer simulation","Transmitters","Mean square error methods","Frequency-selective fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","channel estimation","code division multiple access","equalisers","error statistics","least mean squares methods","mobile radio","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot assisted channel estimation","MC-CDMA signal transmission","overlap FDE","multicarrier code division multiple access","broadband wireless access technique","next generation mobile communications systems","frequency-domain equalization","minimum mean square error","MMSE criterion","channel frequency-selectivity","average bit error rate","BER performance","frequency-diversity gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Frequency-selective fading channel","overlap FDE","Channel estimation","MC-CDMA"]}],"abstract":"Recently, multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) has been attracting much attention as a broadband wireless access technique for the next generation mobile communications systems. Frequency-domain equalization (FDE) based on the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion can take advantage of the channel frequency-selectivity and improve the average bit error rate (BER) performance due to frequency-diversity gain. However, conventional MC-CDMA requires the insertion of guard interval (GI) and this reduces the transmission efficiency. Overlap FDE technique has been proposed that requires no GI insertion. Recently, we showed that MC-CDMA using overlap FDE can provide almost the same BER performance as the conventional MC-CDMA downlink using the GI insertion. However, our previous work assumed the ideal channel estimation. In this paper, we propose a pilot assisted channel estimation technique suitable for MC-CDMA downlink using overlap FDE and evaluate the BER performance by computer simulation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737354","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737354.pdf","startPage":"1106","endPage":"1110","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737354","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot assisted channel estimation for MC-CDMA signal transmission using overlap FDE","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Pilot assisted channel estimation for MC-CDMA signal transmission using overlap FDE","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4737354/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443109","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737354/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot assisted channel estimation for MC-CDMA signal transmission using overlap FDE","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00223.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045614S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4737357,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Xiao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and TechnologyDepartment of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085397807"},{"name":"Wentao Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and TechnologyDepartment of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wentao Chen","id":"37087544490"},{"name":"Depeng Jin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and TechnologyDepartment of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Depeng Jin","id":"37087251462"},{"name":"Lieguang Zeng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and TechnologyDepartment of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lieguang Zeng","id":"37087250525"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737357","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":74},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread ALOHA based random access scheme for macro cell CDMA systems","abstract":"The Slotted ALOHA based random access faces the low throughput and long access delay problems when used in macro cell CDMA systems.

The DCF is a special case in our proposed MAC protocol. We assume the system exist a maximum allowable simultaneously transmissions M which is dependent on the degree of multiple access interference (MAI). To control the access of multiple code channels in DS-CDMA wireless network, we define the channel regulation (CR) which is smaller than M and three channel states which are random access (RA) state, CR state and busy state respectively. The channel is in RA state, CR state and busy state whenever simultaneously transmissions are smaller than CR, between CR and M and larger than M respectively. Nodes can randomly access channel whenever they detect RA state and do p-persistent transmission while CR state is detected. If channel is detected in busy state, nodes have to run backoff algorithm to prepare next time of transmission. The simulation results show that the proposed MAC protocol algorithm performs very well.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737358.pdf","startPage":"1125","endPage":"1129","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An opportunistic MAC protocol for multiple code channels DS-CDMA wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Media Access Protocol","Wireless application protocol","Multiaccess communication","Wireless networks","Access protocols","Multiple access interference","Chromium","Signal processing algorithms","Access control","Direct-sequence code-division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","code division multiple access","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic MAC protocol","multiple code channels DS-CDMA wireless networks","single channel wireless network","distributed coordination function","multiple access interference","channel regulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel regulation (CR)","medium access control (MAC)","direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA)","carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)","p-persistent CSMA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"An opportunistic MAC protocol for multiple code channels DS-CDMA wireless networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737358/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443113","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An opportunistic MAC protocol for multiple code channels DS-CDMA wireless networks","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00227.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065791S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4737359,"authors":[{"name":"Shengming Jiang","affiliation":["Faculty of Advanced Technology, University of Glamorgan, UK","School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Shengming Jiang","id":"37279382800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737359","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Access control","Wireless networks","Channel capacity","Mobile antennas","Antenna arrays","Media Access Protocol","Performance analysis","Proposals","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logical MIMO MAC approach","uplink access control","centralized wireless networks","multiple-input-multiple-output antenna technology","wireless physical channel capacity","medium access control","channel utilization","antenna array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Logical MIMO","medium access control (MAC)","concurrent transmissions","terminal\u2019s throughput","medium access delay and overall channel utilization."]}],"abstract":"The multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology has been extensively used to improve wireless physical channel capacity at the expense of increased implementation complexities especially at mobile terminals since either an antenna array or inter-terminal cooperation is required for implementation.

For chip rate estimation of each user, weighted zero-crossing ratio is proposed. Maximum value of the weighted zero crossing ratio takes place in the sampling frequency, which is equal to the Nyquist rate, and it is same chip rate.

In this paper, we apply LLL-algorithm to joint THP/pre-FDE to avoid the dummy symbol insertion and evaluate the BER performance by computer simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737409/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10443164","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737409/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of joint THP/pre-FDE with lattice reduction using LLL-algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of joint THP/pre-FDE with lattice reduction using LLL-algorithm","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066546S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737409","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4737410,"authors":[{"name":"Koichi Adachi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37292389400"},{"name":"Fumiyuki Adachi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tohoku, Sendai, Japan"],"firstName":"Fumiyuki","lastName":"Adachi","id":"37280708600"},{"name":"Masao Nakagawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Technology, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Masao","lastName":"Nakagawa","id":"37280969000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737410","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":406},"abstract":"For the development of future wireless communication systems, an extremely spectrum-efficient transmission technology is required. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) have been attracting much attention. The use of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission is essential to achieve a very high speed data transmission with the limited bandwidth. In our previous paper, assuming perfect cancellation of inter-code interference (ICI), we have derived a channel capacity expression for MC-CDMA MIMO in a multi-cell environment and confirmed by numerical evaluation that MC-CDMA MIMO provides a slightly higher capacity than OFDM MIMO. In this paper, we theoretically show by using Jensen\u00bfs inequality that the channel capacity of MC-CDMA MIMO assuming perfect ICI cancellation (ICIC) is always higher than or equal to that of OFDM MIMO. Furthermore, we compare the channel capacities of MIMO multiplexing and multiple single-input multiple output (SIMO) system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International

In this paper, the OFCDM system with fractional sampling (FS) is investigated. FS is a diversity scheme with a single antenna, which achieves path diversity through oversampling and parallel signal reception. However, the correlation among noise components may deteriorate the bit error rate (BER) performance at the receiver as the number of subcarriers and oversampling ratio increase. To overcome this problem, the alternative spreading code is used for the FS OFCDM system. Numerical results through computer simulation show that the proposed scheme can improve the performance of the receiver with the large oversampling ratio and the number of subcarriers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4737412/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443167","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fractional sampling OFCDM with alternative spreading code","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fractional sampling OFCDM with alternative spreading code","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00281.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087155S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4737414,"authors":[{"name":"Guangqiu Li","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Guangqiu","lastName":"Li","id":"37598722600"},{"name":"Chengying Wang","affiliation":["School of Communication Engineering, Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Chengying Wang","id":"37634417900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737414","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":167},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Block codes","Quadrature amplitude modulation","MIMO","Fading","Channel estimation","Error analysis","Phase shift keying","Rayleigh channels","Amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel estimation","error statistics","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","quadrature amplitude modulation","Rayleigh channels","space-time codes","telecommunication signalling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["general rectangular QAM","channel estimation error","symbol error rate","SER","orthogonal space-time block coding","MIMO Rayleigh fading channels","quardrature amplitude modulation","M-ary signaling","Gaussian Q-function","OSTBC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal space-time block coding (STBC)","channel estimation error","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems","symbol error rate"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the impact of channel estimation error on the average symbol error rate (SER) of orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) in MIMO Rayleigh fading channels.

In this paper, we propose a novel cognitive MAC protocol to achieve highly efficient spectrum usage and QoS provisioning. In the proposed protocol, secondary users are divided into several non-overlapping groups, and all leftover channels are allocated among groups taking the groups\u00bf bandwidth requirements into consideration.

In this paper, we investigate the maximally achievable revenue obtained from SUs subjected to the interference constraints on PUs and QoS requirements of SUs. To solve the identified issue, we propose an efficient joint admission and power control scheme using a minimal revenue efficiency removal algorithm (JAPC-MRER). In comparison with the other two schemes JAPC-MSRA and JAPC-Random, our strategy can achieve much higher revenue with guaranteed interference requirements and QoS demands.

A newly proposed technology, multiuser reusing one slot (MUROS), would help operators in densely populated cities to alleviate the strain on their networks. The concept of MUROS is based on multiplexing two or more users onto one time slot without degrading the speech quality. We improved one solution of MUROS, orthogonal sub channel (OSC) in this contribution. For the downlink (DL) OSC, we designed new training sequence codes (TSCs) which are low cross-correlated with legacy TSCs. For the uplink (UL) OSC, we adopted successive interference cancellation based on minimum mean square error (MMSE-SIC) algorithm. Theoretical analysis and simulation results shows that with proper TSC design, OSC is a promising scheme of MUROS due to its ability to double the capacity of GSM/EDGE networks without degrading the speech quality very much.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737448/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10443203","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737448/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A scheme of multi-user reusing one slot on enhancing capacity of GSM/EDGE networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scheme of multi-user reusing one slot on enhancing capacity of GSM/EDGE networks","confLoc":"Guangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00317.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049896S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-12"},{"_id":4737449,"authors":[{"name":"David Lopez-Perez","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Lopez-Perez","id":"38277422500"},{"name":"Guillaume de la Roche","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"de la Roche","id":"37294341500"},{"name":"Alvaro Valcarce","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Alvaro","lastName":"Valcarce","id":"37403640700"},{"name":"Alpar Juttner","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Alpar","lastName":"Juttner","id":"37398645200"},{"name":"Jie Zhang","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Network Design (CWiND), University of Bedfordshire, Luton, Bedfordshire, UK"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37281474400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737449","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":81,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":930},"abstract":"Femtocells have been recently proposed as a potential good solution to increase not only indoor radio coverage, but also system capacity.

Under line-of-sight (LOS) propagation conditions in such cooperative networks, the overall fading channel can be modeled by a double Rice process. In this article, we have studied the statistical properties of the capacity of double Rice fading channels. We have derived the analytical expressions for the probability density function (PDF), cumulative distribution function (CDF), level-crossing rate (LCR), and average duration of fades (ADF) of the channel capacity. The obtained results are studied for different values of the amplitudes of the LOS components in the two links of double Rice fading channels. It has been observed that the statistics of the capacity of double Rice fading channels are quite different from those of double Rayleigh and classical Rice fading channels. Moreover, the presence of an LOS component in any of the two links increases the mean channel capacity and the LCR of the channel capacity. The validity of the theoretical results is confirmed by simulations. The results presented in this article can be very useful for communication system designers to optimize the performance of cooperative networks in wireless communication systems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel capacity","Fading","Wireless communication","Rayleigh scattering","Relays","Rayleigh channels","Throughput","Probability density function","Distribution functions","Statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","mobile radio","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify-and-forward channel capacity","line-of-sight propagation","double Rice fading channels","probability density function","cumulative distribution function","level-crossing rate","average duration of fades","double Rayleigh fading channels","mean channel capacity","cooperative networks","wireless communication systems","mobile station"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737455","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737455.pdf","startPage":"1614","endPage":"1619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737455","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the statistical properties of the capacity of amplify-and-forward channels under LOS conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737455","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the statistical properties of the capacity of amplify-and-forward channels under LOS conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737455/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737455/","accessionNumber":"10443210","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the statistical properties of the capacity of amplify-and-forward channels under LOS conditions","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065608S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4737456,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Wu","affiliation":["Department of ICT, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"lastName":"Yi Wu","id":"37281228800"},{"name":"Matthias Patzold","affiliation":["Department of ICT, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Patzold","id":"37268363500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737456","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of amplify-and-forward cooperative communication systems with channel estimation errors","abstract":"Cooperative diversity is a transmission technique that achieves a diversity gain by using a combination of the relayed signal and the direct signal.

Random network coding is performed to provide side information for both the source and relay\u00bfs transmission. This system matrix makes an easy way to collect all independent signal copies to provide a spatial diversity gain. And the complexity of network coding is linear to the block length ~O(n). Then, the optimization of joint network-channel LDPC code is conducted in term of maximizing the system rate. Based on the joint network-channel LDPC codes, we presents a protocol for wireless cooperative communications, which is very effective to combat the channel fading without much rise in system bandwidth and transmitting power. A traditional three-node model is built to describe the protocol where relay not only helps source to transmit but also has its own information to transmit.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design optimization","Parity check codes","Wireless communication","Network coding","Design methodology","Relays","Diversity methods","Wireless application protocol","Fading","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","parity check codes","random codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint network-channel LDPC code","wireless cooperative communications","low density parity check codes","joint network-channel parity check matrix","random network coding","spatial diversity gain","channel fading","three-node model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cooperative communications","LDPC codes","network coding","joint network-channel coding","achievable rate region"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737457","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737457.pdf","startPage":"1625","endPage":"1629","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and optimization of joint network-channel LDPC code for wireless cooperative communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and optimization of joint network-channel LDPC code for wireless cooperative communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737457/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737457/","accessionNumber":"10443212","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and optimization of joint network-channel LDPC code for wireless cooperative communications","confLoc":"Guangzhou","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038271S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4737459,"authors":[{"name":"Ke Feng","affiliation":["School of Electronic and information engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Ke Feng","id":"37652609900"},{"name":"Feng Suili","affiliation":["School of Electronic and information engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Feng Suili","id":"37561580300"},{"name":"Zhuang Hongcheng","affiliation":["Pre-research Department, Huawei Technologies Company Limited, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"lastName":"Zhuang Hongcheng","id":"37658156400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2423-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2424-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4737459","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Rayleigh channels","Power system relaying","Fading","Closed-form solution","Wireless communication","Decoding","Access protocols","Information analysis","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subcarrier pairing capacity analysis","OFDMA","DF relay link","Rayleigh fading channel","fixed pairing strategy","optimal pairing strategy","closed-form expression","orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","capacity","relay","subcarrier pairing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we analyze the end-to-end capacity of subcarrier pairing strageties of OFDMA-base DF relay link over Rayleigh fading channels.

Research on these devices has shown that femtocells will not only increase indoor system coverage, but also system capacity. Femtocells will allow new services and business models to be offered to indoor users. Almost parallely, the WiMAX standard has emerged as a potential candidate technology for the future wireless networks. WiMAX femtocells are currently under development and will therefore play an important role in the world of indoor broadband wireless access. However, several aspects of this new technology, such as the access method and interference avoidance techniques play a crucial role in the amount of interference caused to co-channel deployed macrocells. This paper provides a framework for the study of WiMAX macro-femtocell hybrid scenarios. An in-depth description of the necessary radio coverage prediction and system-level simulation for this kind of scenarios is introduced. Simulations and numerical results for two different types of access methods (public and private) in the downlink are also presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Access methods to WiMAX femtocells: A downlink system-level case study","publicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737463","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 11th IEEE Singapore International Conference on Communication Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723881/4737131/04737463.pdf","startPage":"1657","endPage":"1662","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCS.2008.4737463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737131","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Access methods to WiMAX femtocells: A downlink system-level case study","conferenceDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737463/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443218","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Access methods to WiMAX femtocells: A downlink system-level case study","confLoc":"Guangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"SPI-12272008-00332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099165S","chronDate":"19-21 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723881","isNumber":"4737131","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723881","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"4737131","articleId":"4737463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4737521,"authors":[{"name":"Xian-Jun Shi","affiliation":["College of Science, Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xian-Jun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37652821700"},{"name":"Hong Lei","affiliation":["College of Science, Wuhan University of Science and Engineering, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Lei","id":"37653703400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3435-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1472"}],"articleNumber":"4737521","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737521","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Classification algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Data mining","Databases","Delta modulation","Algorithm design and analysis","Data analysis","Space exploration","Information management","Innovation management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithms","mathematical operators","query formulation","very large databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","knowledge extraction","large databases","data mining algorithm","search strategy","classification rule discovery","encoding design","genetic operator","knowledge discovery"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIII.2008.289","pdfPath":"/iel5/4737476/4737477/04737521.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Management, Innovation Management and Industrial Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Management, Innovation Management and Industrial Engineering","startPage":"175","endPage":"178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIII.2008.289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach for Classification Rule Discovery","abstract":"Data mining has as goal to extract knowledge from large databases. To extract this knowledge, a database may be considered as a large search space, and a mining algorithm as a search strategy. In general, a search space consists of an enormous number of elements, which make it is infeasible to search exhaustively. As a search strategy, genetic algorithms have been applied successfully in many fields. In this paper, we present a genetic algorithm-based approach for mining classification rules from large database. For emphasizing on predictive accuracy, comprehensibility and interestingness of the rules and simplifying the implementation of a genetic algorithm, we discuss detail the design of encoding, genetic operator and fitness function of genetic algorithm for this task. Experimental result shows that genetic algorithm proposed in this paper is suitable for classification rule mining and those rules discovered by the algorithm have higher classification performance to unknown data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737521/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10451473","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4737521/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach for Classification Rule Discovery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm-Based Approach for Classification Rule Discovery","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3435a175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05013S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4737476","isNumber":"4737477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4737476","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4737477","articleId":"4737521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4737732,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Caiqing","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Caiqing","id":"37397581500"},{"name":"Lin Ming","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Ming","id":"37654012100"},{"name":"Tang Mingyang","affiliation":["School of Business Administration, North China Electric Power University, Baoding, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Tang","lastName":"Mingyang","id":"37658179900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3435-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1456"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1472"}],"articleNumber":"4737732","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":267},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Load forecasting","Information management","Innovation management","Industrial engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","backpropagation","electricity supply industry","load forecasting","neural nets","particle swarm optimisation","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BP neural network","PSO Algorithm","daily load forecasting","daily electricity load","electricity industry","artificial neural network","particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Daily Load Forecasting","BP Neural Network","Particle Swarm Optimization","Prediction Accuracy."]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737732","abstract":"Accurate forecasting of daily electricity load has been one of the most important issues in the electricity industry. In recent few decades, the artificial neural network has been successfully employed to solve this problem because of the powerful capability to generalize the nonlinear relationships between the inputs and the desired outputs, without considering real problem domain expressions. A short-term load forecasting method based on BP neural network which is optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is presented in this paper. The PSO is used to optimize the initial parameters of the BP neural network, then based on the optimized result, the BP neural network is used for short-term load forecasting. The experiment results show the method in the paper has greater improvement in both accuracy and velocity of convergence for BP neural network. Consequently, the model is practical and effective and provides a alternative for forecasting electricity load.","doi":"10.1109/ICIII.2008.195","pdfPath":"/iel5/4737476/4737706/04737732.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"85","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Management, Innovation Management and Industrial Engineering","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Information Management, Innovation Management and Industrial Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIII.2008.195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BP Neural Network Optimized with PSO Algorithm for Daily Load Forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737732/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"BP Neural Network Optimized with PSO Algorithm for Daily Load Forecasting","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10519010","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4737732/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BP Neural Network Optimized with PSO Algorithm for Daily Load Forecasting","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3435c082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056088S","chronDate":"19-21 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4737476","isNumber":"4737706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4737476","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4737706","articleId":"4737732","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4737885,"authors":[{"name":"Felix T.

Hence, the problem is divided into SP1: the determination of LS conditions for all lots and SP2: the scheduling of AJSSP after LS conditions have been determined. To solve the problem, we propose an innovative Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach. To investigate the impacts of LS on AJSSP, several system conditions are examined. To justify the GA, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is the benchmarked method. Computational results suggest that equal size LS is the best strategy and GA outperforms PSO for all test problems. Some negative impacts of LS are the increase of work-in-process inventory and total setup cost if the objective is the minimization of total lateness cost.","doi":"10.1109/IEEM.2008.4737885","startPage":"331","endPage":"335","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEM.2008.4737885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737816","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723916/4737816/04737885.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-based approach to job shop scheduling problem with assembly stage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4737885/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm-based approach to job shop scheduling problem with assembly stage","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4737885/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10443296","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm-based approach to job shop scheduling problem with assembly stage","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262008-00069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07703S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723916","isNumber":"4737816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723916","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4737816","articleId":"4737885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4737894,"authors":[{"name":"Ran Quan","affiliation":["Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, China"],"lastName":"Ran Quan","id":"37087516216"},{"name":"Jinbao Jian","affiliation":["Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, CN"],"lastName":"Jinbao Jian","id":"37087521090"},{"name":"Haiyan Zheng","affiliation":["Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, CN"],"lastName":"Haiyan Zheng","id":"37087156798"},{"name":"Linfeng Yang","affiliation":["Guangxi University, Nanning, Guangxi, CN"],"lastName":"Linfeng Yang","id":"37087520202"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2629-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2630-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-3611"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-362X"}],"articleNumber":"4737894","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4737894","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadratic programming","Educational institutions","Large-scale systems","Cost function","Mixed integer linear programming","Computational modeling","Power system simulation","Optimization methods","Dynamic programming","Lagrangian functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","power engineering computing","power generation scheduling","quadratic programming","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mixed integer quadratic programming","unit commitment","branch-and-cut algorithm","CPLEX software","thermal units scheduling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power system","unit commitment","mixed integer quadratic programming","branch-and-cut method"]}],"abstract":"A two-stage algorithm based on branch-and-cut is proposed to solve the unit commitment (UC) problem.

Finally, we prove that the PROMETHEE multicriteria net flow is the centered score that minimizes the sum of the squared deviations from the pairwise comparisons of the alternatives.","doi":"10.1109/IEEM.2008.4738012","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723916/4737816/04738012.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEM.2008.4738012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737816","startPage":"959","endPage":"963","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rank reversal in the PROMETHEE II method: Some new results","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738012","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rank reversal in the PROMETHEE II method: Some new results","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738012/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443423","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4738012/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rank reversal in the PROMETHEE II method: Some new results","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262008-00196.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05523S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723916","isNumber":"4737816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723916","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"4737816","articleId":"4738012","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4738068,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan.

This algorithm combines GA with constraint model based on polychromatic sets theory (PST). According to the characteristic of FJSS problem, this algorithm uses contour matrix to formalize the restrictions between workpiece and operations, and between operations and machines. During the process of encoding, decoding, crossover and mutation, the contour matrixes guarantee the genetic searching in the valid solution space. At the same time, the calculation of fitness value is simplified and the computer programming is easy developed. The disadvantage of traditional GA that is the premature convergence and slow convergent speed are improved. Experimental results demonstrate that this algorithm is very stable and its efficiency is improved. It is fit for solving FJSS problem and dynamic scheduling problem.","doi":"10.1109/IEEM.2008.4738068","pdfPath":"/iel5/4723916/4737816/04738068.pdf","startPage":"1239","endPage":"1243","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEM.2008.4738068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4737816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Job Shop scheduling problem solving based on genetic algorithm with model constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Job Shop scheduling problem solving based on genetic algorithm with model constraints","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10443479","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4738068/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible Job Shop scheduling problem solving based on genetic algorithm with model constraints","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"SPI-12262008-00252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053378S","chronDate":"8-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4723916","isNumber":"4737816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4723916","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4737816","articleId":"4738068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4738260,"authors":[{"name":"Shaolun Zeng","affiliation":["College of Economics and Business Administration, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","Department of Management Science, Sichuan University of Science and Engineering, Zigong, China"],"lastName":"Shaolun Zeng","id":"37410523100"},{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"37656134100"},{"name":"Yulong Ren","affiliation":["College of Economics and Business Administration, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Yulong Ren","id":"37633376400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2629-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2630-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-3611"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-362X"}],"articleNumber":"4738260","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":661},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pricing","Power generation","Forward contracts","Electricity supply industry","Couplings","Power system reliability","Cost function","Power system modeling","Power system security","Energy management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["customer satisfaction","game theory","matrix algebra","power markets","power system economics","pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-of-use electricity pricing model","China","TOU pricing model","user response matrix","customer satisfaction","game theory","electric power market"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electricity","Pricing model","Power market","Survey","TOU rates"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we make a survey on the research of time-of-use (TOU) electricity price and TOU pricing models and methods in China.

The flexibility of SDR solutions is typically obtained at the cost of limited processing power, which imposes the use of low-complexity algorithms. This task is particularly challenging within multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication, which is inherently characterized by heavy signal processing load. In this paper, we present a recursive matrix inversion algorithm for Hermitian positive-definite (HPD) matrices. The algorithm exhibits low computational complexity and is thus particularly suited for the HPD matrix inversion required in MIMO minimum mean squared error receivers.

The coarray (spatial convolution of the transmit and receive arrays) can be used to find efficient array designs that capture all of the spatial frequency content (a transmit-receive element combination corresponds to a spatial frequency) with a reduced number of active channels and firing events. Eliminating the redundancies in the transmit-receive element combinations and firing events reduces the overall system complexity and improves the frame rate. Here we explore four reduced redundancy 2-D array configurations for miniature 3-D ultrasonic imaging systems. Our approach is based on 1) coarray design with reduced redundancy using different subsets of linear arrays constituting the 2-D transducer array, and 2) 3-D scanning using fan-beams (narrow in one dimension and broad in the other dimension) generated by the transmit linear arrays. We form the overall array response through coherent summation of the individual responses of each transmit-receive array pairs. We present theoretical and simulated point spread functions of the array configurations along with quantitative comparison in terms of the front-end complexity and image quality.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.2010936","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5109823/04738328.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.2010936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109823","startPage":"1051","endPage":"1061","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimally Redundant 2-D Array Designs for 3-D Medical Ultrasound Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Minimally Redundant 2-D Array Designs for 3-D Medical Ultrasound Imaging","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10731468","pubMedId":"19131299","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4738328/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimally Redundant 2-D Array Designs for 3-D Medical Ultrasound Imaging","sourcePdf":"tmi-mkaraman-2010936.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119126S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5109823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"5109823","articleId":"4738328","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4738331,"authors":[{"name":"Ivana Isgum","affiliation":["Department of Radiology Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Ivana","lastName":"Isgum","id":"37271670100"},{"name":"Marius Staring","affiliation":["Department of Radiology Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Marius","lastName":"Staring","id":"38294698000"},{"name":"Annemarieke Rutten","affiliation":["Department of Radiology Image Sciences Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Annemarieke","lastName":"Rutten","id":"37565704400"},{"name":"Mathias Prokop","affiliation":["Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Mathias","lastName":"Prokop","id":"37271673700"},{"name":"Max A.

Multiple atlases are registered to a target image. To obtain a segmentation of the target, labels of the atlas images are propagated to it. The propagated labels are combined by spatially varying decision fusion weights. These weights are derived from local assessment of the registration success. Furthermore, an atlas selection procedure is proposed that is equivalent to sequential forward selection from statistical pattern recognition theory. The proposed method is compared to three existing atlas-based segmentation approaches, namely (1) single atlas-based segmentation, (2) average-shape atlas-based segmentation, and (3) multi-atlas-based segmentation with averaging as decision fusion. These methods were tested on the segmentation of the heart and the aorta in computed tomography scans of the thorax. The results show that the proposed method outperforms other methods and yields results very close to those of an independent human observer. Moreover, the additional atlas selection step led to a faster segmentation at a comparable performance.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.2011480","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5109823/04738331.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.2011480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109823","startPage":"1000","endPage":"1010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Atlas-Based Segmentation With Local Decision Fusion\u2014Application to Cardiac and Aortic Segmentation in CT Scans","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Atlas-Based Segmentation With Local Decision Fusion\u2014Application to Cardiac and Aortic Segmentation in CT Scans","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738331/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10731469","pubMedId":"19131298","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4738331/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Atlas-Based Segmentation With Local Decision Fusion\u2014Application to Cardiac and Aortic Segmentation in CT Scans","sourcePdf":"tmi-isgum-2011480.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082826S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5109823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"5109823","articleId":"4738331","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":4738333,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Groher","affiliation":["Computer Aided Medical Procedures and Augmented Reality, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Groher","id":"37662180600"},{"name":"Darko Zikic","affiliation":["Computer Aided Medical Procedures and Augmented Reality, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Darko","lastName":"Zikic","id":"37548035700"},{"name":"Nassir Navab","affiliation":["Computer Aided Medical Procedures and Augmented Reality, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Nassir","lastName":"Navab","id":"37282965500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"4738333","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":5,"totalDownloads":796},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Angiography","Navigation","Layout","Abdomen","Catheters","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Augmented reality","Visualization","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomechanics","blood vessels","deformation","diagnostic radiography","image registration","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deformable 2D-3D registration","vascular structure","angiographic 3D scan","2D projection","3D depth perception","rigid transformation model","3D vessel structure registration","quantitative test","digitally subtracted angiogram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Angiography","deformable registration","2D-3D registration"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Angiography","Artificial Intelligence","Blood Vessels","Carcinoma, Hepatocellular","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Liver","Models, Cardiovascular","Models, Statistical"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738333","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.2011519","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","abstract":"Alignment of angiographic 3D scans to 2D projections is an important issue for 3D depth perception and navigation during interventions.

The general-purpose SPARTAN3E FPGA was employed for developing the prototype, with all the coding done using a hardware description language (HDL) called very high speed integrated circuit (VHDL). The proposed logic employs only one-terminal current samples and is based on wavelet analysis. Depending on the amount of high frequency components in the current signals after processing, the faults are classified into ten types. The real time windows target toolbox of MATLAB was used to apply the current signal inputs to the prototype in real time. An adaptive threshold value is chosen, rather than a fixed threshold in the case of faults involving the ground, to make the classification reliable and accurate. The fault classification time is 6 ms, which is about 1/3 of the power frequency cycle (20 ms). A high level of computational efficiency is achieved as compared to the other wavelet-transform-based algorithms, since only the high frequency details at first level are employed in this algorithm. The validity of the proposed logic was exhaustively tested by simulating various types of faults on a system modeled in the electromagnetic transients program/alternative transients program. The proposed logic was found to be highly reliable and accurate, even in the presence of fault resistance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738338/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601698","htmlLink":"/document/4738338/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"5","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-Speed Fault Classification in Power Lines: Theory and FPGA-Based Implementation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Speed Fault Classification in Power Lines: Theory and FPGA-Based Implementation","sourcePdf":"tie-valsan-2011055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074809S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4897610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4897610","articleId":"4738338","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4738341,"authors":[{"name":"Lijun Gao","affiliation":["Boeing Aerospace Company, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4897610/4738341/4738341-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lijun Gao (M'04\u2013SM'08) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, in 2003.","He is currently an Electrical Design and Analysis Engineer with the Boeing Company, Seattle, WA.

In the usual series-connected wiring scheme, the residual energy generated by partially shaded cells either cannot be collected (if diode bypassed) or, worse, impedes collection of power from the remaining fully illuminated cells (if not bypassed). Rapid fluctuation of the shading pattern makes maximum power point (MPP) tracking difficult; generally, there will exist multiple local MPPs, and their values will change as rapidly as does the illumination. In this paper, a portable solar PV system that effectively eliminates both of the aforementioned problems is described and proven. This system is capable of simultaneously maximizing the power generated by every PV cell in the PV panel. The proposed configuration consists of an array of parallel-connected PV cells, a low-input-voltage step-up power converter, and a simple wide bandwidth MPP tracker. Parallel-configured PV systems are compared to traditional series-configured PV systems through both hardware experiments and computer simulations in this paper. Study results demonstrate that, under complex irradiance conditions, the power generated by the new configuration is approximately twice that of the traditional configuration. The solar PV system can be widely used in many consumer applications, such as PV vests for cell phones and music players.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738341/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","volume":"56","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"10601695","publicationDate":"May 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738341/","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Parallel-Connected Solar PV System to Address Partial and Rapidly Fluctuating Shadow Conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel-Connected Solar PV System to Address Partial and Rapidly Fluctuating Shadow Conditions","sourcePdf":"tie-gao-2011296.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069499S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4897610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"270","xplore-issue":"4897610","articleId":"4738341","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4738342,"authors":[{"name":"Ian Morgan","affiliation":["Institute of Industrial Research, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/4897610/4738342/4738342-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ian Morgan (S'07) received the B.Sc. degree in artificial intelligence and psychology from the University of Birmingham, Birmingham, U.K., in 2002.

In the proposed method, the actual sector containing the tip of the reference space vector need not be identified. A method is presented to identify the center of a sub-hexagon containing the reference space vector. Using the center of the sub-hexagon, the reference space vector is mapped to the innermost sub-hexagon, and the switching sequence corresponding to a two-level inverter is determined. A new technique is proposed in this paper, by which these two-level vectors are translated to the switching vectors of the multilevel inverter by adding the center of the sub-hexagon to the two-level vectors. The proposed method can be extended to any n-level inverter, and a generalized algorithm is proposed. The scheme is explained for a five-level inverter, and experimental results are presented for a three-level inverter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/4897610/04738345.pdf","startPage":"1649","endPage":"1656","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2008.2011337","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2008.2011337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897610","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Space Vector PWM Generation Scheme for Any General --Level Inverter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Voltage","Power engineering and energy","Signal generators","Pulse inverters","Space technology","Table lookup","Pulse modulation","Pulse generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space vector pulsewidth modulation signals","multilevel inverters","reference space vector","switching sequence","sub-hexagon center","space vector PWM generation","general n-level inverter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel inverter","open-end winding","reverse mapping","space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738345/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Space Vector PWM Generation Scheme for Any General <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n$</tex></formula>-Level Inverter","volume":"56","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4738345/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601697","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Space Vector PWM Generation Scheme for Any General <formula formulatype=\"inline\"> <tex Notation=\"TeX\">$n$</tex></formula>-Level Inverter","sourcePdf":"tie-baiju-2011337.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168408S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"4897610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"4897610","articleId":"4738345","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4738347,"authors":[{"name":"Gennadi Y.

For this purpose, a novel dedicated shape-driven directional interpolation algorithm based on a structure tensor approach is developed. Quantitative evaluation shows that this method clearly outperforms conventional scene-based interpolation schemes. Furthermore, the image quality trade-offs associated with the use of interpolated intermediate views are systematically evaluated for simulated and clinical cone-beam computed tomography data sets of the human head. It is found that utilization of directionally interpolated views significantly reduces streak artifacts and noise, at the expense of small introduced image blur.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5109823/04738374.pdf","startPage":"1011","endPage":"1022","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.2011550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.2011550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5109823","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Directional View Interpolation for Compensation of Sparse Angular Sampling in Cone-Beam CT","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Sampling methods","Computed tomography","Detectors","Tensile stress","Image quality","Computational modeling","Humans","Head","Noise reduction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","diagnostic radiography","image reconstruction","image sampling","interpolation","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape-driven directional interpolation algorithm","sparse angular sampling compensation","computed tomography","cone-beam CT","streak artifact reduction","3D sinogram data","image quality","image blur","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aliasing","computed tomography (CT)","image quality","interpolation","reconstruction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Computer Simulation","Cone-Beam Computed Tomography","Head","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Phantoms, Imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","displayDocTitle":"Directional View Interpolation for Compensation of Sparse Angular Sampling in Cone-Beam CT","volume":"28","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4738374/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10731470","pubMedId":"19131294","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Directional View Interpolation for Compensation of Sparse Angular Sampling in Cone-Beam CT","sourcePdf":"tmi-mbertram-2011550.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08737S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5109823","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5109823","articleId":"4738374","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4738375,"authors":[{"name":"Likai Zhu","affiliation":["CREOL, The College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Likai","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37535028600"},{"name":"Xiaoxu Li","affiliation":["CREOL, The College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaoxu","lastName":"Li","id":"37311144900"},{"name":"Eduardo Mateo","affiliation":["CREOL, The College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Mateo","id":"37661453100"},{"name":"Guifang Li","affiliation":["CREOL, The College of Optics and Photonics, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Guifang","lastName":"Li","id":"37279727800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4738375","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"abstract":"A method of designing a complementary filter pair is proposed to reduce error accumulation in the split-step backward propagation for distributed impairment compensation of wavelength-division-multiplexing transmission.

On the contrary, conventional ankle-foot prostheses exhibit a passive-elastic response during stance, and consequently, cannot provide net work. Clinical studies indicate that transtibial amputees using conventional prostheses have higher gait metabolic rates than normal. Researchers believe that the main cause for these higher rates is due to the inability of conventional prostheses to provide sufficient positive power at terminal stance in the trailing leg to limit heel strike losses of the adjacent leading leg. In this investigation, we evaluate the hypothesis that a powered ankle-foot prosthesis, capable of providing human-like ankle work and power during stance, can decrease the metabolic cost of transport (COT) compared to a conventional passive-elastic prosthesis. To test the hypothesis, a powered prosthesis is built that comprises a unidirectional spring, configured in parallel with a force-controllable actuator with series elasticity. The prosthesis is shown to deliver the high mechanical power and net positive work observed in normal human walking. The rate of oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production is measured as a determinant of metabolic rate on three unilateral transtibial amputees walking at self-selected speeds. We find that the powered prosthesis decreases the amputee's metabolic COT on average by 14% compared to the conventional passive-elastic prostheses evaluated (Flex-Foot Ceterus\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">reg</sup>\n and Freedom Innovations Sierra), even though the powered system is over twofold heavier than the conventional devices. These results highlight the clinical importance of prosthetic interventions that closely mimic the mass distribution, kinetics, and kinematics of the missing limb.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Powered Ankle--Foot Prosthesis Improves Walking Metabolic Economy","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.2008747","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4773132/04738392.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.2008747","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4773132","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738392/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Powered Ankle--Foot Prosthesis Improves Walking Metabolic Economy","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4738392/","dateOfInsertion":"03 February 2009","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10460234","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Powered Ankle--Foot Prosthesis Improves Walking Metabolic Economy","sourcePdf":"tro-herr-2008747.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124143S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4773132","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"283","xplore-issue":"4773132","articleId":"4738392","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4738399,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00c9 F.

A novel exact closed-form expression for the average BER of adaptive modulation under MIMO transmit beamforming with maximal ratio combining, assuming prediction errors at the receiver for the adaptation CSI required by the transmitter, is obtained. The benefit of this result with respect to previous analysis is threefold. First, the expression is an exact closed form.

However, it suffers from a 3-dB performance loss as in point-to-point communication systems. In this paper, we propose a new differential modulation scheme, which is referred as generalized differential modulation (GDM) for wireless networks with amplify-and-forward relaying. In the proposed scheme, each frame transmitted by the source is divided into several blocks, and each block consists of one reference symbol and several normal symbols. The reference symbol in each block is differentially encoded based on the previous reference symbol, whereas the normal symbols are differentially encoded based on the reference symbol in the same block. At the destination, the signals from the source and the relays are combined to improve communication reliability. The proposed scheme has the advantage of allowing power allocation among the reference symbol and the normal symbols to improve the system performance. Numerical results show that the proposed GDM scheme can perform very close to the coherent receiver with perfect channel state information (CSI) in slow-fading channels.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital relays","Protocols","Channel estimation","Performance loss","Wireless networks","Power system relaying","Channel state information","Bit error rate","Differential quadrature phase shift keying","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","channel coding","fading channels","modulation coding","radio networks","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differential modulation scheme","amplify-and-forward relaying","wireless relay network","point-to-point communication system","block code","encoding","communication reliability","power allocation","channel state information","slow-fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward (AF)","differential modulation","power allocation","wireless relay networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2012125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5062310/04738402.pdf","startPage":"3058","endPage":"3062","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5062310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2012125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Differential Modulation for Amplify-and-Forward Wireless Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738402","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Differential Modulation for Amplify-and-Forward Wireless Relay Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738402/","volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"July 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738402/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10712996","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Differential Modulation for Amplify-and-Forward Wireless Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-fang-2012125.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075437S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5062310","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5062310","articleId":"4738402","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4738405,"authors":[{"name":"Hamidreza Bolandhemmat","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5062310/4738405/4738405-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hamidreza Bolandhemmat received the M.Sc. degree in aerospace engineering, flight dynamics, and control from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003.

The proposed technique consists of a mechanical stabilization loop and a direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm, which is based on electronic beamforming.

The method utilizes electronic feedback from the phased-array antenna to compensate for the low-cost sensor irregularities. The effectiveness of the proposed tracking method is demonstrated by measured performance of a fast-moving ultra-low-profile phased-array satellite terminal, which uses the proposed approach. The field test results confirm that the hybrid tracking mechanism can nullify the base vehicle yaw disturbances up to 60deg/s and 85deg/s\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and keep the azimuth angle error at less than the permissible bound of [-1deg, +1deg].

The design methodology for the controller simultaneously utilizes the good features of PSO (capable of providing good global search capability, required to provide a high degree of automation) and Lyapunov-based tuning (providing fast adaptation utilizing a local search method).

The output of each sub-ADC is filtered in such a way that, when all the filter outputs are summed, the aliasing components are minimized. If each channel of the filter bank has N coefficients, the optimization of the coefficients requires computing the inverse of an MN times MN matrix if the weighted least squares (WLS) technique is used as the optimization tool. In this paper, we present a multichannel filtering approach for TIADC mismatch compensation. We apply the generalized sampling theorem to directly estimate the ideal output of each sub-ADC using the outputs of all the sub-ADCs. If the WLS technique is used as the optimization tool, the dimension of the matrix to be inversed is N times N. For the same number of coefficients (and also the same spurious component performance given sufficient arithmetic precision), our technique is computationally less complex and more robust than the filter-bank approach. If mixed integer linear programming is used as the optimization tool to produce filters with coefficient values that are integer powers of two, our technique produces a saving in computing resources by a factor of approximately (10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0.2N(M- 1)</sup>\n/(M-1) in the TIADC filter design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/4738417/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10939175","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2009","displayDocTitle":"Time-Interleaved Analog-to-Digital-Converter Compensation Using Multichannel Filters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time-Interleaved Analog-to-Digital-Converter Compensation Using Multichannel Filters","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lim-2012216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.19624S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5272819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5272819","articleId":"4738417","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4738418,"authors":[{"name":"Renfei Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5272819/4738418/4738418-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Renfei Liu (M'05\u2013S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical and information engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests are digital signal processing algorithms, communication systems, and power-/cost-efficient VLSI architectures and implementation."]},"firstName":"Renfei","lastName":"Liu","id":"37575729300"},{"name":"Keshab K.

Multiple steps of the binary trellis are combined into an equivalent one-step complex trellis in time sequence, which is referred to as the branch metric precomputation (BMP). As the look-ahead level increases, the BMP dominates the complexity and delay of the overall system architecture. This paper systematically proposes an optimal branch metric computation scheme with the minimal complexity and latency. The proof of its optimality is also given. This highly efficient scheme leads to a novel overall optimal BMP architecture for any look-ahead level. Furthermore, an alternative technique other than the look-ahead is proposed for reducing the latency at very low complexity cost. This alternative technique can be either applied in combination with the proposed architecture to achieve the lowest latency at a slight increase in complexity or used on its own for low complexity compared with other look-ahead-based architectures. Results show that the three proposed architectures can either reduce complexity by up to 84% or reduce the latency by up to 72.50%.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2012217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2012217","startPage":"2315","endPage":"2324","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/5272819/04738418.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5272819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Latency Low-Complexity Architectures for Viterbi Decoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Low-Latency Low-Complexity Architectures for Viterbi Decoders","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"29 September 2009","volume":"56","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738418/","accessionNumber":"10892916","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738418/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Latency Low-Complexity Architectures for Viterbi Decoders","sourcePdf":"tcsi-rliu-2012217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066652S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"5272819","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5272819","articleId":"4738418","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4738423,"authors":[{"name":"Mika Laiho","affiliation":["Microelectronics Laboratory, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5272819/4738423/4738423-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mika Laiho (M'04) was born in Parkano, Finland, in 1973.

The image to restore is assumed to be sparsely represented in a dictionary of waveforms such as the wavelet or curvelet transforms. Our key contributions are as follows. First, we handle the Poisson noise properly by using the Anscombe variance stabilizing transform leading to a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">nonlinear</i>\n degradation equation with additive Gaussian noise. Second, the deconvolution problem is formulated as the minimization of a convex functional with a data-fidelity term reflecting the noise properties, and a nonsmooth sparsity-promoting penalty over the image representation coefficients (e.g., lscr\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n -norm). An additional term is also included in the functional to ensure positivity of the restored image. Third, a fast iterative forward-backward splitting algorithm is proposed to solve the minimization problem. We derive existence and uniqueness conditions of the solution, and establish convergence of the iterative algorithm. Finally, a GCV-based model selection procedure is proposed to objectively select the regularization parameter. Experimental results are carried out to show the striking benefits gained from taking into account the Poisson statistics of the noise. These results also suggest that using sparse-domain regularization may be tractable in many deconvolution applications with Poisson noise such as astronomy and microscopy.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2008223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4747382/04738431.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2008223","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4747382","startPage":"310","endPage":"321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Proximal Iteration for Deconvolving Poisson Noisy Images Using Sparse Representations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Proximal Iteration for Deconvolving Poisson Noisy Images Using Sparse Representations","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738431/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","accessionNumber":"10399739","pubMedId":"19131301","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Proximal Iteration for Deconvolving Poisson Noisy Images Using Sparse Representations","sourcePdf":"18tip01-fdupe-2008223.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043099S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","isNumber":"4747382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"131","articleId":"4738431","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4738432,"authors":[{"name":"Shuenn-Yuh Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4768995/4738432/4738432-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuenn-Yuh Lee (M'98) was born in Taichung, Taiwan, in 1966.

Since the linearity and noise of the filter is dependent on the building cell, a precise behavioral model for the real OTA circuit is created.

Based on this topology, a chip fabricated in a 0.18- mum CMOS process is simulated and measured to validate the system estimation. Since the battery life and the integration with the low-voltage digital processor are the most critical requirement for the portable diagnosis device, the OTA-based circuit is operated in the subthreshold region to save power under the supply voltage of 1V. Measurement results show that this low-voltage and low-power filter possesses the HD3 of -48.9 dB, dynamic range (DR) of 50 dB, and power consumption of 453 nW.

Image super-resolution, for example, is a typical application where the quality of the super-resolved image is degrading as registration errors increase. Popular registration methods are often based on features extracted from the acquired images. The accuracy of the registration is in this case directly related to the number of extracted features and to the precision at which the features are located: images are best registered when many features are found with a good precision. However, in low-resolution images, only a few features can be extracted and often with a poor precision. By taking a sampling perspective, we propose in this paper new methods for extracting features in low-resolution images in order to develop efficient registration techniques. We consider, in particular, the sampling theory of signals with finite rate of innovation and show that some features of interest for registration can be retrieved perfectly in this framework, thus allowing an exact registration. We also demonstrate through simulations that the sampling model which enables the use of finite rate of innovation principles is well suited for modeling the acquisition of images by a camera. Simulations of image registration and image super-resolution of artificially sampled images are first presented, analyzed and compared to traditional techniques. We finally present favorable experimental results of super-resolution of real images acquired by a digital camera available on the market.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2009378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2009378","startPage":"281","endPage":"298","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4747382/04738434.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4747382","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exact Feature Extraction Using Finite Rate of Innovation Principles With an Application to Image Super-Resolution","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Exact Feature Extraction Using Finite Rate of Innovation Principles With an Application to Image Super-Resolution","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","volume":"18","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738434/","accessionNumber":"10399740","pubMedId":"19131300","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738434/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exact Feature Extraction Using Finite Rate of Innovation Principles With an Application to Image Super-Resolution","sourcePdf":"18tip02-lbaboulaz-2009378.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111832S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4747382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"4747382","articleId":"4738434","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4738436,"authors":[{"name":"Mohsen Mollazadeh","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4768995/4738436/4738436-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mohsen Mollazadeh (S'04) received his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2004 and the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 2006, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include mixed-signal VLSI systems for neural interface, telemetry in implantable systems and the neural mechanisms of dexterous movements."]},"firstName":"Mohsen","lastName":"Mollazadeh","id":"37542627600"},{"name":"Kartikeya Murari","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4768995/4738436/4738436-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Kartikeya Murari (S'02) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 2004, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering.","His research interests lie in mixed-signal VLSI design for biomedical applications in sensing, imaging and power management and in neuromorphic systems."]},"firstName":"Kartikeya","lastName":"Murari","id":"37424380500"},{"name":"Gert Cauwenberghs","affiliation":["Division of Biological Sciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/4768995/4738436/4738436-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Gert Cauwenberghs (S'89-M'94-SM'04) received the M.Eng. degree in applied physics from University of Brussels, Belgium, in 1988, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, in 1989 and 1994.","He is Professor of Biology and Bioengineering at University of California San Diego, where he co-directs the Institute of Neural Computation.

Cloud computing is one contemporary technology in which the research community has recently embarked. Manifesting itself as the descendant of several other computing research areas such as service-oriented architecture, distributed and grid computing, and virtualization, cloud computing inherits their advancements and limitations. Towards the end-goal of a thorough comprehension of the field of cloud computing, and a more rapid adoption from the scientific community, we propose in this paper an ontology of this area which demonstrates a dissection of the cloud into five main layers, and illustrates their interrelations as well as their inter-dependency on preceding technologies. The contribution of this paper lies in being one of the first attempts to establish a detailed ontology of the cloud. Better comprehension of the technology would enable the community to design more efficient portals and gateways for the cloud, and facilitate the adoption of this novel computing approach in scientific environments. In turn, this will assist the scientific community to expedite its contributions and insights into this evolving computing field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Nov. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10443865","htmlLink":"/document/4738443/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"12-16 Nov. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Toward a Unified Ontology of Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward a Unified Ontology of Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"GCE-00-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071116S","chronDate":"12-16 Nov. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4729055","isNumber":"4738437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4729055","citationCount":"436","xplore-issue":"4738437","articleId":"4738443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4738445,"authors":[{"name":"Ian Foster","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA","Math & Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Foster","id":"37276599200"},{"name":"Yong Zhao","affiliation":["Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37277700600"},{"name":"Ioan Raicu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Ioan","lastName":"Raicu","id":"37268610600"},{"name":"Shiyong Lu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Shiyong","lastName":"Lu","id":"37280072400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2860-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2152-1085"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2152-1093"}],"articleNumber":"4738445","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1383,"citationCountPatent":27,"totalDownloads":24178},"abstract":"Cloud computing has become another buzzword after Web 2.0.

Parameters included conformal coating methods, underfill, solder mask defined, and non-solder mask defined pads. Board-level temperature cycling, vibration, and combined temperature cycling and vibration testing were performed to quantify the reliability and identify preferred design parameters. Through the main effects and interaction analysis, test results show underfill is the key parameter related to the solder joint reliability improvement. Conformal coat method and printed circuit board pad design are not main effects on solder joint reliability. No interactive relationship exists among these three factors under temperature cycling loading, but some interactive relationship between printed circuit board pad type and the conformal coating method exists under vibration and combined loading conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738456/","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10414827","volume":"32","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of Experiments for Board-Level Solder Joint Reliability of PBGA Package Under Various Manufacturing and Multiple Environmental Loading Conditions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Experiments for Board-Level Solder Joint Reliability of PBGA Package Under Various Manufacturing and Multiple Environmental Loading Conditions","sourcePdf":"tepm-hqi-2005905.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07425S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"6104","isNumber":"4747373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6104","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4747373","articleId":"4738456","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4738458,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Vassiliadis","affiliation":["Electronics and Computers Section, Physics Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4749486/4738458/4738458-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nikolaos Vassiliadis (S'05) received the MSc diploma in electronics in 2004 and is currently working toward the PhD degree at the Section of Electronics & Computers, Physics Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.

A CCU can be a hardwired or a reconfigurable unit, which can be utilized following a tight and/or loose model of computation. By selecting the appropriate model of computation for each part of the application, the complete application space is considered for acceleration, resulting in significant performance improvements. Also, ARISE offers modularity and scalability and is not restricted by the opcode space and operands limitation problems that exist in such type of machines. To support these features we introduce a machine organization that allows the cooperation of a processor and a set of CCUs. To control the CCUs we extend once the instruction set of the processor with eight instructions. To efficiently incorporate these features to an embedded processor, we propose a micro-architecture implementation that minimizes the control and communication overhead between the processor and the CCUs. To evaluate our proposal, we extended a MIPS processor with the ARISE infrastructure and implemented it on a Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Implementation results, demonstrate that the timing model of the processor is not affected. Also, we implemented a set of benchmarks on the ARISE evaluation machine. Performance results prove significant improvements and reduced communication overhead compared to a typical coprocessor approach.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2004482","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4749486/04738458.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"233","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2004482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ARISE Approach for Extending Embedded Processors With Arbitrary Hardware Accelerators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 January 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738458/","displayDocTitle":"The ARISE Approach for Extending Embedded Processors With Arbitrary Hardware Accelerators","volume":"17","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738458/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","accessionNumber":"10391571","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ARISE Approach for Extending Embedded Processors With Arbitrary Hardware Accelerators","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-vassiliadis-2004482.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102606S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4749486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4749486","articleId":"4738458","onlineDate":"06 January 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4738464,"authors":[{"name":"Satyajayant Misra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Satyajayant Misra received his integrated M.Sc.

We also review existing cross-layer approaches and propose a few possible cross-layer solutions to optimize the performance of a given wireless sensor network for multimedia streaming applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A survey of multimedia streaming in wireless sensor networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","doi":"10.1109/SURV.2008.080404","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel5/9739/4738460/04738464.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"39","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SURV.2008.080404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738464/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Fourth Quarter  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourth Quarter  2008","displayDocTitle":"A survey of multimedia streaming in wireless sensor networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4738464/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Fourth Quarter 2008","accessionNumber":"10370228","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A survey of multimedia streaming in wireless sensor networks","sourcePdf":"4Reisslein.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166201S","chronDate":"Fourth Quarter  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"4738460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"267","xplore-issue":"4738460","articleId":"4738464","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4738466,"authors":[{"name":"Thuy T.T.

This survey paper looks at emerging research into the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to IP traffic classification - an inter-disciplinary blend of IP networking and data mining techniques. We provide context and motivation for the application of ML techniques to IP traffic classification, and review 18 significant works that cover the dominant period from 2004 to early 2007. These works are categorized and reviewed according to their choice of ML strategies and primary contributions to the literature. We also discuss a number of key requirements for the employment of ML-based traffic classifiers in operational IP networks, and qualitatively critique the extent to which the reviewed works meet these requirements.

Nonparametric Wiener filtering is used at the end of six configurations of dispersion compensation (DC) transmission lines: pre- and postlumped DC, distributed DC without optical phase conjugation (OPC), dispersion inversion (DI) about midlink OPC with, respectively, one-for-multispan, single type span and alternate type span on each side of OPC. It is found that single-DI and alternate-DI schemes have higher input power capacity than one-for-multi-DI scheme. Further reductions in the nonlinear phase noise accumulation for all these DC maps are obtained with Wiener filtering, and higher absolute dispersion can decrease signal fluctuation due to nonlinear phase noise, as well.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Wiener filter","Phase noise","Optical noise","Channel capacity","Time domain analysis","Frequency domain analysis","Timing jitter","Optical pulses","Pulse amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical fibre dispersion","optical fibre networks","optical information processing","phase noise","timing jitter","Wiener filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parametric amplified noise reduction","nonlinear fiber channels","nonparametric Wiener filtering","nonlinear phase noise","multispan fiber optics transmissions","time-domain concepts","timing jitter","ghost pulses","intrachannel nonlinearities","dispersion compensation transmission lines","dispersion inversion","one-for-multispan","single type span","alternate type span"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fiber nonlinearities","nonlinear phase noise","parametric amplified noise","Wiener filtering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2008.928913","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/4738506/04738520.pdf","startPage":"3210","endPage":"3215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738506","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2008.928913","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduction of Parametric Amplified Noise in Nonlinear Fiber Channels by Use of Wiener Filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Parametric Amplified Noise in Nonlinear Fiber Channels by Use of Wiener Filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738520/","volume":"26","issue":"18","publicationDate":"Sept.15, 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738520/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10370279","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.15,  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.15,  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Parametric Amplified Noise in Nonlinear Fiber Channels by Use of Wiener Filtering","sourcePdf":"26jlt18-qi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060422S","chronDate":"Sept.15,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4738506","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4738506","articleId":"4738520","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":4738531,"authors":[{"name":"Stojan Z.

For memoryless channels, the capacities and achievable rates are computed and compared for both uniform and ldquopositiverdquo Gaussian inputs subject to different assumptions on the CSI availability. For the strong turbulence regime, it is shown that the knowledge of CSI both at the transmitter and the receiver increases the achievable rates for low-to-moderate Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) in comparison to the cases for which the CSI is known only at the receiver. For the weak turbulence regime however, the availability of CSI at both ends of the link does not provide any improvement over a system with CSI known at the receiver alone, and we find that a simple channel inversion technique suffices. In addition, for low SNRs, Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM) with M ges 4 levels outperforms Gaussian-distributed inputs regardless of the knowledge of CSI at the transmitter. For high SNRs, a Gaussian distribution gives superior results, implying the need for new, more efficient positive signal constellations. For channels with memory and without knowledge of CSI, a change in the channel quasifrequency has negligible effects on the capacity for any turbulence regime.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.1,  2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1,  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738531/","volume":"26","issue":"19","htmlLink":"/document/4738531/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10370286","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct.1, 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Information Theoretic Limits for Free-Space Optical Channels With and Without Memory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Theoretic Limits for Free-Space Optical Channels With and Without Memory","sourcePdf":"26jlt19-denic.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072049S","chronDate":"Oct.1,  2008","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"4738524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4738524","articleId":"4738531","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-02"},{"_id":4738549,"authors":[{"name":"Ezra Ip","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Ezra Ip received the B.E.

In particular, no information on the plant, sensor and disturbance dynamics is needed in the design of this neural network disturbance compensator. The second neural network, designed to compensate for the pivot friction, uses a signum activation function to introduce nonlinearities inherent to pivot friction, thus reducing the neural network\u2019s burden of expectation. The stability of the proposed scheme is analyzed by the Lyapunov criterion.

In the infinite horizon discounted reward setting, we show that both the greedy and optimal policies eventually coincide and settle on the best arm, in contrast with the Incomplete Learning Theorem for the case of independent arms. In the total reward setting, we show that the cumulative Bayes risk after T periods under the greedy policy is at most O (log T), which is smaller than the lower bound of \u00bf (log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n T) established by [1] for a general, but different, class of bandit problems.

However few publications consider FDI applications to unmanned air vehicles (UAV) where full-autonomy is obligatory. In this paper we demonstrate a sensor fault detection and accommodation (SFDA) system, which makes use of analytical redundancy between flight parameters, on a UAV model. A Radial-Basis Function (RBF) neural network (NN) trained online with Extended Minimum Resource Allocating Network (EMRAN) algorithms is chosen for modelling purposes due to its ability to adapt well to nonlinear environments while maintaining high computational speeds. Furthermore, in an attempt to reduce false alarms (FA) and missed faults (MF) in current SFDA systems, we introduce a novel residual generator. After 47 minutes (CPU running time) of NN offline training, the SFDA scheme is able to detect additive and constant bias sensor faults with zero FA and MF. It also shows good global approximation capabilities, essential for fault accommodation, with an average pitch gyro estimation error of 0.0075 rad/s.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4738703","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1242","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04738703.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4738703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based sensor validation scheme demonstrated on an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) model","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Neural networks","Fault detection","Redundancy","Aircraft","Feedback loop","Costs","Parameter estimation","Noise measurement","Logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","radial basis function networks","remotely operated vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","sensor validation scheme","unmanned air vehicle model","fault detection","extended minimum resource allocating network","radial-basis function","missed faults","false alarms","pitch gyro estimation error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based sensor validation scheme demonstrated on an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) model","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738703/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10441902","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based sensor validation scheme demonstrated on an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) model","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076491S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4738703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4738765,"authors":[{"name":"Ion Necoara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering ESAT/SCD, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ion","lastName":"Necoara","id":"37299149400"},{"name":"Dang Doan","affiliation":["Delft Center of Systems and Control, Technische Universiteit Delft, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Dang","lastName":"Doan","id":"37648302500"},{"name":"Johan A.K.

Currently available methods either compute the optimal controller online or derive an explicit control law. In this paper we introduce a new approach combining the two paradigms of explicit and online MPC to overcome their individual limitations. The algorithm computes a piecewise affine approximation of the optimal solution that is used to warm-start an active set linear programming procedure. A preprocessing method is introduced that provides hard real-time, stability and performance guarantees for the proposed controller. By choosing a combination of the quality of the approximation and the number of online active set iterations the presented procedure offers a tradeoff between the warm-start and online computational effort. We show how the problem of identifying the optimal tradeoff for a given set of requirements on online computation time, storage and performance can be solved. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the proposed warm-start procedure on a numerical example.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Predictive control","Optimal control","Linear programming","Control systems","Laboratories","Storage automation","Automatic control","Approximation algorithms","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","linear programming","predictive control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time suboptimal model predictive control","explicit MPC","online optimization","optimal controller","piecewise affine approximation","active set linear programming"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4738813","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04738813.pdf","startPage":"4718","endPage":"4723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4738813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time suboptimal model predictive control using a combination of explicit MPC and online optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Real-time suboptimal model predictive control using a combination of explicit MPC and online optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738813/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738813/","accessionNumber":"10442012","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time suboptimal model predictive control using a combination of explicit MPC and online optimization","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054239S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4738813","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4738814,"authors":[{"name":"Travis Dierks","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Travis","lastName":"Dierks","id":"37546896900"},{"name":"S.

network (NN) control, a combination of weighted one-step-ahead control and adaptive NN is developed for a class of multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems. The weighted one-step-ahead control is designed to stabilize the nominal linear system, while the adaptive NN compensator is introduced to deal with the nonlinearities. Under the assumption that the inverse control gain matrix has an either positive definite or negative definite symmetric part, the obstacle in NN weights tuning for the MIMO systems is transformed to unknown control direction problem for single-input-single-output (SISO) system. Discrete Nussbaum gain is introduced into the NN weights adaptation law to overcome the unknown control direction problem. It is proved that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded, while the tracking error converges to a compact set. Simulation result illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed control.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4738830","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04738830.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4738830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","startPage":"3646","endPage":"3651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stable adaptive neural network control of MIMO nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stable adaptive neural network control of MIMO nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738830/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442029","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4738830/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stable adaptive neural network control of MIMO nonaffine nonlinear discrete-time systems","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.152095S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4738830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4738860,"authors":[{"name":"Angelia Nedic","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Enterprise Systems Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Angelia","lastName":"Nedic","id":"38186294000"},{"name":"Alex Olshevsky","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Olshevsky","id":"37299603300"},{"name":"Asuman Ozdaglar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Asuman","lastName":"Ozdaglar","id":"37300992700"},{"name":"John N.

For this problem, we use averaging algorithms to develop distributed subgradient methods that can operate over a time-varying topology. Our focus is on the convergence rate of these methods and the degradation in performance when only quantized information is available. Based on our recent results on the convergence time of distributed averaging algorithms, we derive improved upper bounds on the convergence rate of the unquantized subgradient method. We then propose a distributed subgradient method under the additional constraint that agents can only store and communicate quantized information, and we provide bounds on its convergence rate that highlight the dependence on the number of quantization levels.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04738860.pdf","startPage":"4177","endPage":"4184","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4738860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4738860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed subgradient methods and quantization effects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Convergence","Optimization methods","Network topology","Upper bound","Resource management","Control systems","Communication industry","Computer industry","Electrical equipment industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","optimisation","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed subgradient methods","quantization effects","convex unconstrained optimization problem","agent objective functions","averaging algorithms","time-varying topology","performance degradation","distributed averaging algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Distributed subgradient methods and quantization effects","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738860/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442059","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed subgradient methods and quantization effects","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078535S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4738860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4738927,"authors":[{"name":"Xun-Lin Zhu","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China","School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, Zhangzhou, Henan, China"],"lastName":"Xun-Lin Zhu","id":"37087483065"},{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Integrated Automation of Process Industry, Ministry of Education, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Guang-Hong Yang","id":"37087156650"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4738927","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Neural networks","Delay effects","Stability criteria","Signal processing","Image processing","Neurons","Linear matrix inequalities","Computational complexity","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","time-varying systems","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network stability analysis","time-varying delay","activation functions","Lyapunov functionals","delay-dependent stability criteria","linear matrix inequalities","computational complexity","LMI"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738927","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of stability analysis for neural networks (NNs) with a time-varying delay.

The new delay-dependent stability conditions are further illustrated by numerical results and are also compared with the existing results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738931/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10442130","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738931/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of dynamical neural networks with uncertain delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of dynamical neural networks with uncertain delays","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082171S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4738931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4738939,"authors":[{"name":"Anton Cervin","affiliation":["Automatic Control LTH, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anton","lastName":"Cervin","id":"37298817000"},{"name":"Toivo Henningsson","affiliation":["Automatic Control LTH, Lund University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Toivo","lastName":"Henningsson","id":"37658794800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4738939","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":94,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":864},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communication system control","Control systems","Sampling methods","Time division multiple access","Multiaccess communication","Frequency division multiaccess","Communication system traffic control","Stochastic systems","Actuators","Sensor systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","control engineering computing","frequency division multiple access","scheduling","stochastic systems","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling","event-triggered controller","shared network","independent control loops","time-triggered control loops","event-triggered control loops","shared communication network","first-order linear stochastic system","communication delay","numerical method","minimum-variance control performance","MAC-protocols","TDMA","FDMA","CSMA","random access","dynamic-priority access","static-priority access"]}],"abstract":"We consider a system where a number of independent, time-triggered or event-triggered control loops are closed over a shared communication network. Each plant is described by a first-order linear stochastic system. In the event-triggered case, a sensor at each plant frequently samples the output but attempts to communicate only when the magnitude of the output is above a threshold. Once access to the network has been gained, the network is busy for T seconds (corresponding to the communication delay from sensor to actuator), after which the control action is applied to the plant. Using numerical methods, we compute the minimum-variance control performance under various common MAC-protocols, including TDMA, FDMA, and CSMA (with random, dynamic-priority, or static-priority access). The results show that event-triggered control under CSMA gives the best performance throughout.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4738939","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04738939.pdf","startPage":"3601","endPage":"3606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4738939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling of event-triggered controllers on a shared network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738939/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling of event-triggered controllers on a shared network","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442138","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738939/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling of event-triggered controllers on a shared network","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100571S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4738939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4738950,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro Garcia","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control CINVESTAV-IPN AP. 14740, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Mexico"],"firstName":"Alejandro","lastName":"Garcia","id":"37556562900"},{"name":"Alexander Poznyak","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control CINVESTAV-IPN AP. 14740, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional, Mexico"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Poznyak","id":"37299681700"},{"name":"Isaac Chairez","affiliation":["Superior School of Chemical Engineering and Extractive Industries (ESIQIE-IPN) Edif. 7, UPALM, Mexico"],"firstName":"Isaac","lastName":"Chairez","id":"37297205600"},{"name":"Tatyana Poznyak","affiliation":["Superior School of Chemical Engineering and Extractive Industries (ESIQIE-IPN) Edif. 7, UPALM, Mexico"],"firstName":"Tatyana","lastName":"Poznyak","id":"37297207700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4738950","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738950","abstract":"A class of dynamic neural network (DNN) observers involving a projection operator inside is considered. Such observers seem to be useful when an uncertain nonlinear system, affected by external perturbations, keeps its states in an a priori known compact set, defined by the given state constraints independently of the measurement noise effects. Since the projection method introduces discontinuities into the trajectory dynamics, the standard Lyapunov method is not applicable to describe the convergence property of this class of observers. This problem is suggested to be resolved using a Lyapunov-Krasovski functional including both the estimation error and the weights involved in the DNN description. The stable adaptive laws for the DNN-weights adjustment are derived. The upper bound for the estimation error is obtained based on linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique implementation. An illustrative example clearly shows the effectiveness of the suggested approach. It deals with an environment control problem, related to the soil contaminants degradation by ozonation.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4738950","startPage":"3652","endPage":"3657","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04738950.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4738950","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Projectional differential neural network observer with stable adaptation weights","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Estimation error","Nonlinear systems","Noise measurement","Pollution measurement","Lyapunov method","Convergence","Observers","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","neural nets","nonlinear systems","observers","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["projectional differential neural network observer","stable adaptation weights","dynamic neural network observers","uncertain nonlinear system","trajectory dynamics","standard Lyapunov method","Lyapunov-Krasovski functional","linear matrix inequality technique"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Projectional differential neural network observer with stable adaptation weights","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738950/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442149","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Projectional differential neural network observer with stable adaptation weights","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087036S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4738950","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4738955,"authors":[{"name":"D.

User utility is modeled as a concave function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the base station, and the problem is formulated as a Stackelberg game. Namely, the service provider imposes differentiated prices per unit of transmitting power and the users consequently update their power levels to maximize their net utilities. We devise a pricing policy and give conditions for its optimality when all the users are to be accommodated in the network. We show that there exist infinitely many Nash equilibrium points that reward the service provider with the same revenue. The pricing policy charges more from users that have better channel conditions and more willingness to pay for the provided service. We then study properties of the optimal revenue with respect to different parameters in the network. We show that for regimes with symmetric users who share the same level of willingness to pay, the optimal revenue is concave and increasing in the number of users in the network. We analytically obtain achievable SNRs for this special case, and finally present a numerical study in support of our results.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4738975","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04738975.pdf","startPage":"1422","endPage":"1427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4738975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A stackelberg game for pricing uplink power in wide-band cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4738975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4738975/","displayDocTitle":"A stackelberg game for pricing uplink power in wide-band cognitive radio networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442174","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4738975/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A stackelberg game for pricing uplink power in wide-band cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080528S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4738975","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4738979,"authors":[{"name":"M.

We also derive an analytical universal upper bound on the performance of the optimal policy.

However, recent trends in the mobile phone industry suggest that GPS equipped devices will become standard in the next few years. Leveraging these GPS equipped devices as traffic sensors will fundamentally change the type and the quality of traffic data collected on large scales in the near future. New traffic models and data assimilation algorithms must be developed to efficiently transform this data into usable traffic information. In this work, we introduce a new partial differential equation (PDE) based on the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards PDE, which serves as a flow model for velocity. We formulate a Godunov discretization scheme to cast the PDE into a Velocity Cell Transmission Model (CTM-v), which is a nonlinear dynamical system with a time varying observation matrix. The Ensemble Kalman Filtering (EnKF) technique is applied to the CTM- v to estimate the velocity field on the highway using data obtained from GPS devices, and the method is illustrated in microsimulation on a fully calibrated model of I880 in California. Experimental validation is performed through the unprecedented 100-vehicle Mobile Century experiment, which used a novel privacy-preserving traffic monitoring system to collect GPS cell phone data specifically for this research.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739016","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739016.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","startPage":"5062","endPage":"5068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ensemble Kalman filtering approach to highway traffic estimation using GPS enabled mobile devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An ensemble Kalman filtering approach to highway traffic estimation using GPS enabled mobile devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739016/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442215","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","htmlLink":"/document/4739016/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An ensemble Kalman filtering approach to highway traffic estimation using GPS enabled mobile devices","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00456.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065213S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739016","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":4739025,"authors":[{"name":"Bahne Christiansen","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Numerische Mathematik und Angewandte Mathematik, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Uiiiversit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster, Munster, Germany"],"firstName":"Bahne","lastName":"Christiansen","id":"37659030900"},{"name":"Helmut Maurer","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Numerische Mathematik und Angewandte Mathematik, Westf\u00e4lische Wilhelms-Uiiiversit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster, Munster, Germany"],"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Maurer","id":"37408624300"},{"name":"Oliver Zirn","affiliation":["Institut of Prozess-und Produktionsleittechnik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Clausthal, Clausthal-Zellerfeld, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Zirn","id":"37592405600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4739025","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":408},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimal control","Friction","Mechatronics","Electrodynamics","Hydraulic actuators","Pneumatic actuators","Machine tools","Bonding","Valves","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bang-bang control","friction","hydraulic drives","machine control","machine tools","mechatronics","microactuators","nonlinear programming","optimal control","pneumatic drives","valves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["voice-coil-motor","Coulombic friction","mechatronic device","electrodynamic actuator","machine tool axes","bonding machines","hydraulic/pneumatic valve drives","dynamical system","jump function","nonsmooth optimization problems","time-optimal controls","bang-bang","nonlinear programming methods","parametric sensitivity derivatives","energy-optimal solutions"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739025","abstract":"The voice-coil-motor is a widely used mechatronic device, which represents a typical electrodynamic actuator for machine tool axes, bonding machines and hydraulic/pneumatic valve drives. One principal task consists in steering the system precisely to a prescribed target in minimal time or with minimal energy. To achieve this goal, we formulate an optimal control problem using a dynamical system derived in Zirn [19]. Since Coulombic friction is modelled by a jump function depending on the sign of the velocity, the optimal control problem belongs the class of nonsmooth optimization problems. We show that time-optimal controls are bang-bang for all physically reasonable control bounds. Switching times are directly optimized by nonlinear programming methods, which also allow to compute parametric sensitivity derivatives. Energy-optimal solutions are presented for several fixed final times.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739025","startPage":"1557","endPage":"1562","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739025.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal control of a voice-coil-motor with Coulombic friction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739025/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal control of a voice-coil-motor with Coulombic friction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739025/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10442224","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal control of a voice-coil-motor with Coulombic friction","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00465.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051536S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4739041,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Valadkhan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Valadkhan","id":"37658404800"},{"name":"Kirsten Morris","affiliation":["Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Kirsten","lastName":"Morris","id":"37287083700"},{"name":"Amir Khajepour","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Khajepour","id":"37442322000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4739041","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Pi control","Hysteresis","Control systems","Magnetic materials","Magnetostriction","Actuators","Steady-state","Robust stability","Nonlinear control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","PI control","position control","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust PI control","hysteretic systems","controller gain parameter","closed-loop system","constant reference input","zero steady-state error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739041","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739041.pdf","startPage":"3787","endPage":"3792","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust PI control of hysteretic systems","abstract":"Stability, tracking and the trajectories of a class of hysteretic systems controlled by a PI controller is considered.

Sensing platforms in the air and sea are often pushed off course by strong and variable flow fields such as atmospheric winds and ocean currents.

In this paper, we describe a planar motion model that explicitly incorporates a uniform and constant flow field. We also provide decentralized control algorithms that stabilize circular motion, in which all of the particles travel around a circle with a fixed center, and times-play circular motion, in which the vehicle velocities are synchronized modulo a constant time delay. The proposed time-splay circular formation algorithm - a composition of the circular formation algorithm and a delay differential equation on the N-torus - generates a set of vehicle trajectories that collectively sample each point on the circle at a regular interval.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Atmospheric modeling","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Vehicle dynamics","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Oceans","Motion control","Distributed control","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","cooperative systems","decentralised control","delays","differential equations","mobile robots","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative control","autonomous sampling network","external flow field","cooperative steering controls","mobile sampling platforms","decentralized control algorithms","time-splay circular formation algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739077","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739077.pdf","startPage":"3095","endPage":"3100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cooperative control of an autonomous sampling network in an external flow field","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cooperative control of an autonomous sampling network in an external flow field","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739077/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739077/","accessionNumber":"10442276","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cooperative control of an autonomous sampling network in an external flow field","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00517.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065597S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4739085,"authors":[{"name":"Rishi Graham","affiliation":["The Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, University of California, Santa Cruz, USA"],"firstName":"Rishi","lastName":"Graham","id":"37411343300"},{"name":"Jorge Cortes","affiliation":["The Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Cortes","id":"37286603500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4739085","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739085","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Robot kinematics","Robot sensing systems","Sea measurements","Data acquisition","Relays","Upper bound","Atmospheric measurements","Optimal control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative systems","data acquisition","distributed control","multi-robot systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative deployment strategy","robotic agents","spatiotemporal estimation","spatiotemporal random field","distributed coordination algorithm","data acquisition"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a network composed of robotic agents and static nodes performing spatial estimation of a dynamic physical process.

We allow control policies that are memoryless functions of noisy measurements of the state of the delay system. We adopt a first order state-space representation for the delay system, where the initial state of the system is a Gaussian and zero mean random variable. In addition, we assume that the measurement noise is drawn from a white and Gaussian process with zero mean and constant variance. Performance evaluation is carried out via a finite-time quadratic cost that combines the second moment of the control signal, and the second moment of the difference between the initial state and the state at the final time. We show that if the time-horizon is one or two then the optimal control is a linear function of the plant?s output, while for a sufficiently large horizon a control taking only two values will outperform the optimal linear solution. This paper complements the well known counterexample by Hans Witsenhausen, which showed that the solution to a linear, quadratic and Gaussian optimal control paradigm might be nonlinear. Witsenhausen?s counterexample considered an optimization horizon with two time-steps (two stage control). In contrast to Witsenhausen?s work, the solution to our counterexample is linear for one and two stages but it becomes nonlinear as the number of stages is increased. Existing tests for linearity of the optimal memoryless control consider only the two-stage problem. The fact that our paradigm leads to non-linear solutions, in the multi-stage case, could not be predicted from prior results. In particular, the fact that the optimal solution for the two stage problem is linear, but the multiple stage might not be, also shows that dynamic programming principles cannot be used for our paradigm. Our paper provides analytical proofs which hold for any number of stages.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739088","startPage":"1628","endPage":"1635","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739088.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite horizon optimal memoryless control of a delay in Gaussian noise: A simple counterexample","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Finite horizon optimal memoryless control of a delay in Gaussian noise: A simple counterexample","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739088/","accessionNumber":"10442287","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739088/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite horizon optimal memoryless control of a delay in Gaussian noise: A simple counterexample","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057584S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4739098,"authors":[{"name":"Michael M.

Besides its theoretical significance, its frequent appearance in the areas of distributed control and facility allocation, where the problems\u00bf size and the cost for global computation and information can be highly prohibitive, gives rise to the need for local solutions that dynamically assign distinct agents to distinct tasks, while maximizing the total assignment benefit. In this paper, we consider the linear assignment problem in the context of networked systems, where the main challenge is dealing with the lack of global information due to the limited communication capabilities of the agents. We address this challenge by means of a distributed auction algorithm, where the agents are able to bid for the task to which they wish to be assigned. The desired assignment relies on an appropriate selection of bids that determine the prices of the tasks and render them more or less attractive for the agents to bid for. Up to date pricing information, necessary for accurate bidding, can be obtained in a multi-hop fashion by means of local communication between adjacent agents. Our algorithm is an extension to the parallel auction algorithm proposed by Bertsekas et al to the case where only local information is available and it is shown to always converge to an assignment that maximizes the total assignment benefit within a linear approximation of the optimal one.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739098","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","startPage":"1212","endPage":"1217","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739098.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A distributed auction algorithm for the assignment problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4739098/","displayDocTitle":"A distributed auction algorithm for the assignment problem","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442297","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A distributed auction algorithm for the assignment problem","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053021S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4739105,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Wang","firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293620900"},{"name":"Michael D.

Each agent receives a signal about an underlying state and communicates with a subset of agents (his neighbors) in each period. The network is connected. In contrast to the majority of existing learning models, we focus on the case where the underlying state is time-varying. We consider the following class of rule of thumb learning rules: at each period, each agent constructs his posterior as a weighted average of his prior, his signal and the information he receives from neighbors. The weights given to signals can vary over time and the weights given to neighbors can vary across agents. We distinguish between two subclasses: (1) constant weight rules; (2) diminishing weight rules. The latter reduces weights given to signals asymptotically to 0. Our main results characterize the asymptotic behavior of beliefs. We show that the general class of rules leads to unbiased estimates of the underlying state. When the underlying state has innovations with variance tending to zero asymptotically, we show that the diminishing weight rules ensure convergence in the mean-square sense. In contrast, when the underlying state has persistent innovations, constant weight rules enable us to characterize explicit bounds on the mean square error between an agent\u2019s belief and the underlying state as a function of the type of learning rule and signal structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4739167/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442366","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Convergence of rule-of-thumb learning rules in social networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence of rule-of-thumb learning rules in social networks","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075549S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4739168,"authors":[{"name":"David W.

The robots are heterogeneous in that the sensor footprints are different. Our work uses the location optimization framework in with three significant extensions. First, we consider robots with different sensor footprints, allowing, for example, aerial and ground vehicles to collaborate. We allow for finite size robots which enables implementation on real robotic systems. Lastly, we extend the previous work allowing for deployment in non convex environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739194.pdf","startPage":"3947","endPage":"3952","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensing and coverage for a network of heterogeneous robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Density functional theory","Land vehicles","Collaborative work","Optimization methods","Euclidean distance","System performance","Quantization","Robot control","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational geometry","distributed sensors","mobile robots","multi-robot systems","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous robot network sensing","heterogeneous robot network coverage","location optimization framework","aerial vehicle","ground vehicle","nonconvex environment","mobile sensing agent","centroidal Voronoi tessellation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739194/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Sensing and coverage for a network of heterogeneous robots","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739194/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442392","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensing and coverage for a network of heterogeneous robots","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00634.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045461S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4739205,"authors":[{"name":"Tamer Basar","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Tamer","lastName":"Basar","id":"37282738200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4739205","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":306},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Control systems","Shape control","Cost function","Random variables","Shape measurement","Optimal control","Probability distribution","Stochastic systems","Nash equilibrium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear quadratic Gaussian control","nonlinear control systems","stochastic games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic decision problems","nonclassical information","stochastic linear-quadratic Gaussian","fixed information structure","nonlinear optimal policies","multistage decision problems","stochastic dynamic games","Nash equilibrium"]}],"abstract":"This is a semi-tutorial paper that places Witsenhausen\u00bfs celebrated 1968 counterexample within a broad class of dynamic decision problems with nonclassical information, which includes stochastic linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) teams as well as LQG zero-sum stochastic games.

For graphs that contain cycles, a characterization of the resulting equilibria is given based on the properties of the cycle space of the graph.

A slight simplification of the generalized RNN approach is also proposed that facilitates practical application. To use the RNN for linear parameter-varying (LPV) controller synthesis, a method is presented of transforming it into a discrete-time quasi LPV model in polytopic and linear fractional transformation (LFT) representations. A novel indirect technique for closed-loop identification with RNNs is proposed here to identify a black box model for an arm-driven inverted pendulum (ADIP). The identified RNN model is then transformed into a quasi-LPV model. Based on such LPV models, two discrete-time LPV controllers are synthesized to control the ADIP. The first one is a full-order standard polytopic LPV controller and the second one is a fixed-structure LPV controller in LFT form based on the quadratic separator concept. Experimental results illustrate the practicality of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739222","startPage":"3860","endPage":"3865","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739222.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739222","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural-network based technique for modelling and LPV control of an arm-driven inverted pendulum","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Recurrent neural networks","Stability","Signal processing","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Robust control","Particle separators","Neurofeedback","Control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["closed loop systems","control system synthesis","discrete time systems","identification","linear systems","modelling","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","pendulums","recurrent neural nets","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent neural network","arm-driven inverted pendulum","stability","closed-loop identification","contraction mapping theorem","sign-permutation equivalence","linear parameter-varying controller synthesis","discrete-time quasi LPV model","linear fractional transformation","black box model","quadratic separator concept","full-order standard polytopic LPV controller"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739222/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A neural-network based technique for modelling and LPV control of an arm-driven inverted pendulum","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739222/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442420","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural-network based technique for modelling and LPV control of an arm-driven inverted pendulum","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00662.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072561S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739222","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4739246,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Kuipers","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Kuipers","id":"37396652600"},{"name":"Petros Ioannou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Petros","lastName":"Ioannou","id":"37281518200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4739246","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739246","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive control","Programmable control","Switches","Robust control","Control systems","Uncertainty","Interpolation","Signal generators","Robust stability","Parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous systems","control system analysis","control system synthesis","interpolation","model reference adaptive control systems","parameter estimation","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deterministic multiple model adaptive mixing control approach","pedagogical manner","continuous mixing","controller interpolation method","online parameter estimation","system stability","system robustness","controller design","controller analysis"]}],"abstract":"We apply the adaptive mixing control approach to a simple example, presenting concepts of the design and analysis of these schemes in a pedagogical manner.

It is shown that any transmission zeros of the augmented system will also be among the transmission zeros of the original plant.

This class of optimization problems, known as rank minimization, is NP-HARD, and for most practical problems there are no efficient algorithms that yield exact solutions. A popular heuristic algorithm replaces the rank function with the nuclear norm-equal to the sum of the singular values-of the decision variable. In this paper, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition that quantifies when this heuristic successfully finds the minimum rank solution of a linear constraint set. We further show that most of the problems of interest in control can be formulated as rank minimization subject to such linear constraints. We additionally provide a probability distribution over instances of the affine rank minimization problem such that instances sampled from this distribution satisfy our conditions for success with overwhelming probability provided the number of constraints is appropriately large. Finally, we give empirical evidence that these probabilistic bounds provide accurate predictions of the heuristic\u00bfs performance in non-asymptotic scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739332/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10442530","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739332/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Necessary and sufficient conditions for success of the nuclear norm heuristic for rank minimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Necessary and sufficient conditions for success of the nuclear norm heuristic for rank minimization","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00772.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074084S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739332","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4739339,"authors":[{"name":"Bjorn Johansson","affiliation":["The ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Bjorn","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37287547300"},{"name":"Tamas Keviczky","affiliation":["The Delft Center for Systems and Control, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Tamas","lastName":"Keviczky","id":"37299733100"},{"name":"Mikael Johansson","affiliation":["The ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikael","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37265388800"},{"name":"Karl Henrik Johansson","affiliation":["The ACCESS Linnaeus Centre, School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Karl Henrik","lastName":"Johansson","id":"37270842500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4739339","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":148,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1802},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Distributed algorithms","Computer network management","Resource management","Iterative algorithms","Topology","Convergence","Large-scale systems","Application software","Sensor systems and applications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subgradient methods","consensus algorithms","convex optimization problems","local subgradient steps","standard sequential procedure","cyclic procedure"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we propose a subgradient method for solving coupled optimization problems in a distributed way given restrictions on the communication topology.

Based on the fault information obtained during the diagnostic procedure, a fault-tolerant control component is designed to compensate for the effect of faults. In the presence of a fault, a baseline controller guarantees the boundedness of all system signals until the fault is detected. Then the controller is reconfigured after fault detection to compensate for the fault using online fault diagnostic information. Under certain assumptions, the stability and tracking performances of the closed-loop system are rigorously investigated. It is shown that, the system signals always remain bounded, and the output tracking error converges to a neighborhood of the origin of the state space.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739347","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","startPage":"398","endPage":"403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739347.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Fault tolerant systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","MIMO","Fault detection","Fault diagnosis","Fault tolerance","Stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","compensation","control system synthesis","fault diagnosis","fault tolerance","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","stability","state-space methods","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive fault-tolerant control","nonlinear MIMO systems","integrated fault diagnosis","fault-tolerant control methodology","fault-tolerant control component","compensation","baseline controller","fault detection","online fault diagnostic information","stability","tracking performances","closed-loop system","system signals","output tracking error","state space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive fault-tolerant control of a class of nonlinear MIMO systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739347/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739347/","accessionNumber":"10442545","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive fault-tolerant control of a class of nonlinear MIMO systems","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00787.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046202S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4739352,"authors":[{"name":"Even Borhaug","affiliation":["Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Even","lastName":"Borhaug","id":"37300783500"},{"name":"A.

Traditional LOS guidance has several nice properties and is widely used in practice for path following of marine vehicles. However, it has the drawback of being susceptible to environmental disturbances.

By modeling primary user activities and secondary user block fading channels as finite state Markov chains, we formulate the transmission rate adaptation problem of each secondary user as a zero-sum dynamic Markovian game with a delay constraint. The Nash equilibrium of the resulting game is available and all of the Nash equilibria have a unique value vector. Conditions are given so that the Nash equilibrium transmission policy of each user is a randomized mixture of pure threshold policies. Such threshold policies are easily implementable. Finally, we present a stochastic approximation algorithm which can adaptively estimate Nash equilibrium policies and track such policies for non-stationary problems where the statistics of the channel and user parameters evolve with time.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739401","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739401.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739401","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","startPage":"3823","endPage":"3828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission control in cognitive radio systems with latency constraints as a switching control dynamic game","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739401","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Transmission control in cognitive radio systems with latency constraints as a switching control dynamic game","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739401/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739401/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10442599","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission control in cognitive radio systems with latency constraints as a switching control dynamic game","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062624S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4739414,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Mazo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Mazo","id":"37283418800"},{"name":"Paulo Tabuada","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Paulo","lastName":"Tabuada","id":"37300854400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4739414","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":147,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1486},"abstract":"Event-triggered and self-triggered control have been recently proposed as an alternative to the more traditional periodic execution of control tasks. The possibility of reducing the number of executions while guaranteeing desired levels of performance makes event-triggered and self-triggered control very appealing in the context of sensor/actuator networks. In this setting, reducing the number of times that a feedback control law is executed implies a reduction in transmissions and thus a reduction in energy expenditures. In this paper we introduce two novel distributed implementations of event-triggered and self-triggered policies over sensor/actuator networks and discuss their performance in terms of energy expenditure.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Sampling methods","Energy consumption","Frequency","Control systems","Information analysis","Feedback control","Data mining","Throughput","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["actuators","distributed sensors","feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-triggered control","self-triggered control","sensor-actuator networks","feedback control law","energy expenditure"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739414","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739414.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"440","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On event-triggered and self-triggered control over sensor/actuator networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On event-triggered and self-triggered control over sensor/actuator networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739414/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739414/","accessionNumber":"10442612","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On event-triggered and self-triggered control over sensor/actuator networks","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00854.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056395S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4739423,"authors":[{"name":"Eleftheria Athanasopoulou","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Eleftheria","lastName":"Athanasopoulou","id":"37317874700"},{"name":"Christoforos N.

The periodic sampling task involves two phases: a sampling interval and an initialization interval. During the sampling interval, both vehicles must employ their aerobiological sampling devices and follow a precise ground track in the presence of sustained winds. During the initialization interval, the vehicles move to their respective initial states to begin the next sampling interval. To maximize the volume of air sampled by the UAVs during an individual sampling mission, the initialization interval must be as short as possible. The paper provides a simple, geometric method for generating candidate time optimal paths in steady winds, based on Dubins\u00bf well-known results for minimum time paths of bounded curvature. The approach is used to generate paths for both UAVs, which must coordinate their motion along their respective paths in order to avoid collision.

Inspired by the utility of studying long block-lengths in information theory, we formulate a vector version of the counterexample. Information-theoretic arguments are then used to derive bounds on the minimum cost for the vector problem. Restricted to the scalar case, the lower bounds are a strict improvement over Witsenhausen's lower bound for some parameter values. The upper bounds are based on two strategies that can asymptotically outperform optimal linear and nonlinear scalar strategies. To investigate the computational aspects of such problems, we then consider a simpler problem of lossless source coding. From a distributed control perspective, the computations required for encoding and decoding can be viewed as internal communication between virtually distributed agents. We derive new lower bounds that establish a tradeoff between the computation, communication and distortion costs for lossless source coding.","doi":"10.1109/CDC.2008.4739477","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.2008.4739477","startPage":"1636","endPage":"1641","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/4721212/4738560/04739477.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 47th IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4738560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A vector version of witsenhausen\u2019s counterexample: A convergence of control, communication and computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A vector version of witsenhausen\u2019s counterexample: A convergence of control, communication and computation","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739477/","accessionNumber":"10442675","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739477/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A vector version of witsenhausen\u2019s counterexample: A convergence of control, communication and computation","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058316S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739477","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":4739489,"authors":[{"name":"Maben Rabi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"firstName":"Maben","lastName":"Rabi","id":"37300807400"},{"name":"Karl H.

Two architectures are considered: one with the controller co-located with the sensor and one with the control co-located with the actuator. A stochastic control problem with an optimal stopping rule is shown to capture two interesting instances of these architectures. The solution of the problem leads to a parametrization of the control alphabet as piecewise constant commands. The execution of the control commands is triggered by stopping rules for the sensor. In simple situations, it is possible to analytically derive the optimal controller. Examples illustrate how the new event-based control and sensing strategies outperform conventional time-triggered schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739489/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10442687","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","conferenceDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4739489/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimal stopping for event-triggered sensing and actuation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal stopping for event-triggered sensing and actuation","confLoc":"Cancun, Mexico","sourcePdf":"SPI-12242008-00929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03957S","chronDate":"9-11 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4721212","isNumber":"4738560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4721212","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4738560","articleId":"4739489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4739501,"authors":[{"name":"Marianne Akian","affiliation":["CMAP, INRIA-Saclay \u00cele-de-France, France"],"firstName":"Marianne","lastName":"Akian","id":"37301338700"},{"name":"Stephane Gaubert","affiliation":["CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, Palaiseau, France"],"firstName":"Stephane","lastName":"Gaubert","id":"37301339500"},{"name":"Asma Lakhoua","affiliation":["Paris-Rocquencourt, INRIA, France","ENIT-LAMSIN, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Asma","lastName":"Lakhoua","id":"37658449800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3123-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3124-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0191-2216"}],"articleNumber":"4739501","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":47},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convergence","Finite element methods","Optimal control","Equations","State-space methods","Dynamic programming","Testing","Lagrangian functions","Finite difference methods","Viscosity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence of numerical methods","finite element analysis","Galerkin method","matrix algebra","optimal control","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence analysis","max-plus finite element method","deterministic optimal control problem","Petrov-Galerkin finite element method","matrix algebra","optimisation"]}],"abstract":"We consider the Max-Plus Finite Element Method for Solving Deterministic Optimal Control Problems, which is a max-plus analogue of the Petrov-Galerkin finite element method.

This paper presents a novel approach for power transformer fault diagnosis based on probabilistic neural network and dissolved gas-in-oil analysis (DGA) technique. A new hybrid evolutionary algorithm combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and back- propagation (BP)algorithm, referred to as HPSO-BP algorithm, is proposed to select optimal value of PNN parameter. The HPSO-BP algorithm is developed in such a way that PSO algorithm is used to do a global search to give a good direction to the global optimal region, and then BP algorithm is used as a fine tuning to determine the optimal solution at the final. The experimental results show that the proposed approach has a better ability in terms of diagnosis accuracy and computational efficiency compared with a number of popular fault diagnosis techniques.","doi":"10.1109/IITA.2008.381","startPage":"545","endPage":"549","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2008.381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4739515","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4739514/4739515/04739632.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid PSO-BP Based Probabilistic Neural Network for Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739632/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Hybrid PSO-BP Based Probabilistic Neural Network for Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4739632/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10451705","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid PSO-BP Based Probabilistic Neural Network for Power Transformer Fault Diagnosis","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3497a545.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057624S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4739514","isNumber":"4739515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4739514","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4739515","articleId":"4739632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4739655,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Xuan","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xuan","id":"37647345700"},{"name":"Zhang Minglu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Minglu","id":"37271527000"},{"name":"Liu Wei","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, Hebei University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Wei","id":"37651474500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3497-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4739655","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739655","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Service robots","Robotics and automation","Intelligent robots","Mobile robots","Design methodology","Weapons","Costs","Robotic assembly","Information technology","Mechanical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular robot design","bottom-up approach","system design"]}],"abstract":"Reseach on modular robot is a hotspot in the robot field.

According to the nice localization ability and directional characteristic of wavelet multi-resolution analysis, an effective target detection algorithm based on wavelet transform is proposed. Firstly, the original image is decomposed twice by wavelet transform to get its horizontal and vertical high frequency image. Based on the difference spreading properties of small target and noise wavelet transform modulus maxima, noise is suppressed and signal is enhanced by multiplying the high frequency part of same direction under difference scales. Secondly, according to the certain selection criterion, the horizontal and vertical high frequency coefficients are preserved separately in the direction of column and row. Finally, infrared small target is detected by fusing the horizontal and vertical preserved results.

In this paper, two critical improvements are introduced into our previous works about CPGABL: first, balancing strategy of ranking individuals is adopted to guarantee first the diversity of population and then the convergence of algorithm; second, rearrangement to chaotic sequences is redesigned to maintain both good diversity and appropriate computational complexity.

A simple DZFD method is given to reduce the computational complexity of the DMLD method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Comparison of the STBC-OFDM Decoders in a Fast Fading Channel","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","doi":"10.1109/IITA.2008.318","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4739514/4739706/04739873.pdf","startPage":"791","endPage":"795","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2008.318","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4739706","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739873/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance Comparison of the STBC-OFDM Decoders in a Fast Fading Channel","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4739873/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10451928","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Comparison of the STBC-OFDM Decoders in a Fast Fading Channel","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3497b791.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051368S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4739514","isNumber":"4739706","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4739514","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4739706","articleId":"4739873","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4739888,"authors":[{"name":"Fengjun Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China","School of Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fengjun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37655280400"},{"name":"Zhiliang Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhiliang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37291898300"},{"name":"Zhengguang Xu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhengguang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37399426700"},{"name":"Jiang Xiao","affiliation":["School of Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37404396300"},{"name":"Guojiang Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guojiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37536949600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3497-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4739888","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face recognition","Wavelet transforms","Neural networks","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","Image recognition","Image databases","Mouth","Eyebrows","Image segmentation","Bagging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","Karhunen-Loeve transforms","neural nets","visual databases","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform","neural network","facial expression recognition","CMU-PITTSBURGH AU-Coded Face Expression Image Database","Karhunen-Loeve transform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["artificial psychology","facial expression recognition","wavelet transform","neural network ensemble"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739888","abstract":"The paper presents a facial expression recognition approach based on wavelet transform features and neural network ensemble classifier for the six basic facial expressions from static images of the CMU-PITTSBURGH AU-Coded Face Expression Image Database.

Different from conventional gradient neural networks (GNN), such RNN (or termed specifically as Zhang neural networks, ZNN) are designed based on matrix-valued error functions, instead of scalar-valued error functions. In addition, they are usually depicted in implicit dynamics rather than explicit dynamics. In this paper, we develop, generalize, simulate and compare the ZNN and GNN models for online solution of time-varying matrix square roots. Besides, important simulation techniques are investigated to help simulate both models.

The optimization method not only has strong global search capability, but also is very easy to implement. Thus, in the study, the proposed PSO-SVM model is applied to fault diagnosis of turbo-generator, among which PSO is used to determine free parameters of support vector machine.

Firstly, for the given geological drill hole data, adaptive neural network is adopted to forecast ore grade of information unknown areas within the geological sections and then geological layered data is obtained. Secondly, based on discretization meshwork model, topological relations for control points can be established automatically between adjacent data layers, so as to construct surface model of 3D spatial entity, which can be visualized by OpenGL technique. Finally, to evaluate the performance of the approach proposed, a 3D simulation system was developed.

This paper has taken research on the key issues of the FPGA implementation of neural networks, discussing on the following issues: data representation, inner-products computation, and implementation of activation function, storage and update of weights, nature of learning algorithm and design constraints. It also introduces some relatively mature and new methods and pointed out their deficiencies and future works.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Key Issues of FPGA Implementation of Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/IITA.2008.239","startPage":"259","endPage":"263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IITA.2008.239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4739938","publicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Second International Symposium on Intelligent Information Technology Application","pdfPath":"/iel5/4739514/4739938/04739998.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4739998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4739998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Key Issues of FPGA Implementation of Neural Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4739998/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2008","accessionNumber":"10465462","conferenceDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Key Issues of FPGA Implementation of Neural Networks","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"3497d259.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03304S","chronDate":"20-22 Dec. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4739514","isNumber":"4739938","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4739514","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4739938","articleId":"4739998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"}]
