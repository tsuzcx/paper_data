The longitudinal flight dynamic model of CRW was developed, and the trim result was derived in the full flight envelope. The linear model of CRW was derived by the Jacobian linear method, and it was nonlinearly dependent on the time-varying flight speed and altitude. The tensor-product (TP) model transformation was adopted to transform the model to a convex polytopic model form. Hence, a linear parameter-varying (LPV) synthesis method was used to design the flight control system of CRW in the rotary mode. The simulation results show that the desired performance objectives are achieved in the rotary flight stage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and LPV flight control of the Canard Rotor/ Wing unmanned aerial vehicle","publicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Management Science and Electronic Commerce (AIMSEC)","doi":"10.1109/AIMSEC.2011.6011121","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Management Science and Electronic Commerce (AIMSEC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992814/6009617/06011121.pdf","startPage":"2187","endPage":"2191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIMSEC.2011.6011121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009617","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011121","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and LPV flight control of the Canard Rotor/ Wing unmanned aerial vehicle","conferenceDate":"8-10 Aug. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6011121/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12258281","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and LPV flight control of the Canard Rotor/ Wing unmanned aerial vehicle","confLoc":"Deng Feng, China","sourcePdf":"K80644.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042383S","chronDate":"8-10 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5992814","isNumber":"6009617","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5992814","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6009617","articleId":"6011121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6011154,"authors":[{"name":"Quang Thao Le","affiliation":["Radio Physics Department, Physics Faculty, Hanoi University of Science, VNU, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Quang Thao","lastName":"Le","id":"37087208648"},{"name":"Ngoc Dinh Nguyen","affiliation":["Radio Physics Department, Physics Faculty, Hanoi University of Science, VNU, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Ngoc Dinh","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37087209190"},{"name":"Trung Thong Dam","affiliation":["Radio Physics Department, Physics Faculty, Hanoi University of Science, VNU, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Trung Thong","lastName":"Dam","id":"37087208059"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0536-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0535-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0534-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6011154","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011154","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Genetic algorithms","Adaptive arrays","Interference","Jamming","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays","beam steering","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude nulling","phase adaptive nulling","genetic algorithm","phase array antennas","beam steering phase shifters","amplitude weights"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["phase array antenna","genetic algorithm","adaptive nulling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/AIMSEC.2011.6011154","pdfPath":"/iel5/5992814/6009617/06011154.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Management Science and Electronic Commerce (AIMSEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Management Science and Electronic Commerce (AIMSEC)","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6009617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIMSEC.2011.6011154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude and phase adaptive nulling with a genetic algorithm for array antennas","abstract":"This paper researchs an efficient by using the genetic algorithm apply in amplitude and phase to adaptive nulling for phase array antennas.

Simulation results show that the proposed watermarking system is resilient in face of various format manipulations (such as font type, font size, fond color, underline, and line space) as well as content tampers (such as replacement, insertion and deletion of words and paragraphs).

Based on a dual-band T-shaped network and a coupled line network, different dual-band components needed in Doherty PA topology, including a 3-dB branch-line coupler, an offset line, and a quarter-wavelength transformer, are developed. Two prototypes with balanced and imbalanced backoff power range modes are implemented to verify the feasibility. Continuous wave signal test results show that the proposed dual-band PA successfully achieves a power-added efficiency of 33% and 30% at the 6-dB backoff point from the saturated output power at 880 and 1960 MHz, respectively. To meet linearity requirements, the PA nonlinear behavior is characterized by using digital multitone signals, which categorize the distortions of a concurrent dual-band PA into intermodulation and cross-modulation. Finally, a 2-D digital predistortion technique is used to compensate for the nonlinearity of PA in dual bands. Two two-tone signals are applied to the dual bands for linearization, and the experimental results show that this technique achieves improvements of better than 19.1 and 24.6 dB for the intermodulation and cross-modulation in the dual bands, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2011.2164089","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/6041064/06011666.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2011.2164089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041064","startPage":"2537","endPage":"2546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Linearization of Concurrent Dual-Band Doherty Power Amplifier With Frequency-Dependent Power Ranges","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011666","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Linearization of Concurrent Dual-Band Doherty Power Amplifier With Frequency-Dependent Power Ranges","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011666/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12288015","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6011666/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Linearization of Concurrent Dual-Band Doherty Power Amplifier With Frequency-Dependent Power Ranges","sourcePdf":"tmtt-chen-2164089-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092607S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6041064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"6041064","articleId":"6011666","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6011674,"authors":[{"name":"Sheng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/6163420/6011674/6011674-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sheng Lin (S'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004.

This paper presents a comprehensive treatment (model, analysis, and design) for hardening storage elements (memories and latches) against a soft error resulting in a multiple-node upset at 32-nm feature size in CMOS. A novel 13T memory cell configuration is proposed, analyzed, and simulated to show a better tolerance to the likely multiple-node upset. The proposed hardened memory cell utilizes a Schmitt trigger (ST) design. As evidenced in past technical literature and used in this work, simulation of all node pairs by current sources results in an assessment similar to 3-D device tools; the simulation results show that the proposed 13T improves substantially over DICE in the likely and realistic scenarios of very diffused or limited charge sharing/collection. Moreover, the 13T cell achieves a 33% reduction in write delay and only a 5% (9%) increase in power consumption (layout area) compared to the DICE cell (consisting of 12 transistors). The analysis is also extended to hardened latches; it is shown that the latch with the highest critical charge has also the best tolerance to a multiple-node upset. Among the hardened latches, the ST designs have the best tolerance, and in particular, the transmission gate configuration is shown to be the most effective. Simulation results are provided using the predictive technology file for 32-nm feature size in CMOS. Monte Carlo simulation confirms the excellent multiple-node upset tolerance of the proposed hardened storage elements in the presence of process, voltage, and temperature variations in their designs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011674/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","volume":"12","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12571585","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2012","publicationDate":"March 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6011674/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of Nanoscale CMOS Storage Elements for Single-Event Hardening With Multiple-Node Upset","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of Nanoscale CMOS Storage Elements for Single-Event Hardening With Multiple-Node Upset","sourcePdf":"tdmr-lombardi-2167233-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104973S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"6163420","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"6163420","articleId":"6011674","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6011676,"authors":[{"name":"Kambiz Afrooz","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/6182948/6011676/6011676-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kambiz Afrooz (S'06) was born in Baft, Iran, in 1983.

The results of the proposed algorithm are confirmed by those of the Leap-Frog algorithm. The unconditionally stable algorithm alone cannot decrease the time consumption, especially when the MTL is excited by modulated signals. The complex phasor transformation approach is used to separate the modulating signal from the carrier signal when an MTL is excited by a modulated signal. A new set of equations is generated using this approach. The new equations are based on the modulating signal, and the carrier signal is eliminated in these equations. The derived equations are solved by Leap-Frog algorithm, and the results confirm the accuracy of these equations. Finally, the proposed equations are solved by the unconditionally stable algorithm at several temporal step sizes. The results indicate that this method has much lower CPU time compared with the conventional method and also has a very good accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/6182948/06011676.pdf","startPage":"482","endPage":"494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2011.2161765","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2011.2161765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6182948","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Method for Time-Domain Analysis of Lossy Nonuniform Multiconductor Transmission Line Driven by a Modulated Signal Using FDTD Technique","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Time domain analysis","Transmission line matrix methods","Mathematical model","Stability analysis","Finite difference methods","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","modulation","multiconductor transmission lines","signal denoising"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain analysis","lossy nonuniform multiconductor transmission line analysis","modulated signal","FDTD technique","unconditionally stable finite-difference time-domain algorithm","leap-frog algorithm","time consumption","phasor transformation approach","carrier signal elimination"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex phasor transformation","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","lossy nonuniform multiconductor transmission line (MTL)","modulated signal","unconditionally stable algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Method for Time-Domain Analysis of Lossy Nonuniform Multiconductor Transmission Line Driven by a Modulated Signal Using FDTD Technique","volume":"54","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6011676/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"12656321","dateOfInsertion":"16 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Method for Time-Domain Analysis of Lossy Nonuniform Multiconductor Transmission Line Driven by a Modulated Signal Using FDTD Technique","sourcePdf":"temc-afrooz-2161765-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093551S","chronDate":"April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"6182948","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"6182948","articleId":"6011676","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6011682,"authors":[{"name":"Gon\u00e7alo Candido","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Electrot\u00e9cnica, Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia, CTS-UNINOVA, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6056501/6011682/6011682-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gon\u00e7alo C\u00e2ndido (M'07) received the Licentiate degree in electrotechnical and computing engineering from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal, in 2006.

It continuously spreads across the diverse layers of the enterprise organization and disparate domains of application envisioning a unified communication solution. In the industrial domain, Evolvable Production System (EPS) paradigm focus on the identification of guidelines and solutions to support the design, operation, maintenance, and evolution of complete industrial infrastructures. Similarly to several other domains, the crescent ubiquity of smart devices is raising important lifecycle concerns such as device setup, control, management, supervision and diagnosis. From initial setup and deployment to system lifecycle monitoring and evolution, each device needs to be taken into account and easily reachable. The present work exploits the association of EPS and SOA paradigms in the pursuit of a common architectural solution to support the different phases of the device lifecycle. The result is a modular, adaptive and open infrastructure forming a complete SOA ecosystem that will make use of the embedded capabilities supported by the proposed device model. The infrastructure components are specified and it is shown how they can interact and be combined to adapt to current system specificity and requirements. Finally, a proof-of-concept prototype deployed in a real industrial production scenario is also detailed and results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2166779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6056501/06011682.pdf","startPage":"759","endPage":"767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2166779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Service-Oriented Infrastructure to Support the Deployment of Evolvable Production Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011682/","displayDocTitle":"Service-Oriented Infrastructure to Support the Deployment of Evolvable Production Systems","volume":"7","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12332406","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6011682/","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Service-Oriented Infrastructure to Support the Deployment of Evolvable Production Systems","sourcePdf":"tii-candido-2166779-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062274S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6056501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6056501","articleId":"6011682","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6011683,"authors":[{"name":"Tapiwa M.

Experiences have shown that the hierarchical, centrally controlled grid of the 20th Century is ill-suited to the needs of the 21st Century. To address the challenges of the existing power grid, the new concept of smart grid has emerged. The smart grid can be considered as a modern electric power grid infrastructure for enhanced efficiency and reliability through automated control, high-power converters, modern communications infrastructure, sensing and metering technologies, and modern energy management techniques based on the optimization of demand, energy and network availability, and so on. While current power systems are based on a solid information and communication infrastructure, the new smart grid needs a different and much more complex one, as its dimension is much larger. This paper addresses critical issues on smart grid technologies primarily in terms of information and communication technology (ICT) issues and opportunities. The main objective of this paper is to provide a contemporary look at the current state of the art in smart grid communications as well as to discuss the still-open research issues in this field. It is expected that this paper will provide a better understanding of the technologies, potential advantages and research challenges of the smart grid and provoke interest among the research community to further explore this promising research area.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2011.2166794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6056501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2011.2166794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/6056501/06011696.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Grid Technologies: Communication Technologies and Standards","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Smart Grid Technologies: Communication Technologies and Standards","volume":"7","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6011696/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12332416","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011696/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Grid Technologies: Communication Technologies and Standards","sourcePdf":"tii-sahin-2166794-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104994S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"6056501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"1583","xplore-issue":"6056501","articleId":"6011696","onlineDate":"06 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":6011699,"authors":[{"name":"Li Da Xu","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology and Decision Sciences, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/6056501/6011699/6011699-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Li Da Xu (M\u203286\u2013SM\u203211) received the M.S. degree in information science from the University of Science and Technology of China, in 1981, and the Ph.D. degree in systems sciences with emphasis on information systems from Portland State University, Portland, in 1986.","He serves as the Founding Chair of IFIP TC8 WG8.9 and the Founding Chair of the IEEE SMC Society Technical Committee on Enterprise Information Systems."]},"firstName":"Li Da","lastName":"Xu","id":"37675863600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-3203"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0050"}],"articleNumber":"6011699","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":419,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7792},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society","url":"http://www.ieee-smc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ies/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Industrial Applications Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ias/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Enterprise resource planning","Modeling","Informatics","Information processing","Supply chains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business process re-engineering","corporate modelling","grid computing","service-oriented architecture","supply chain management","workflow management software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["industrial information integration method","business process management","workflow management","enterprise application integration","service oriented architecture","grid computing","formal method","system method","complex enterprise system modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Emerging technologies","enterprise information systems (EIS)","enterprise systems (ES)","industrial informatics","industrial information integration engineering (IIIE)"]}],"abstract":"Rapid advances in industrial information integration methods have spurred tremendous growth in the use of enterprise systems. Consequently, a variety of techniques have been used for probing enterprise systems. These techniques include business process management, workflow management, Enterprise Application Integration (EAI), Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), grid computing, and others. Many applications require a combination of these techniques, which is giving rise to the emergence of enterprise systems. Development of the techniques has originated from different disciplines and has the potential to significantly improve the performance of enterprise systems. However, the lack of powerful tools still poses a major hindrance to exploiting the full potential of enterprise systems. In particular, formal methods and systems methods are crucial for modeling complex enterprise systems, which poses unique challenges.

The concept of managing the trade-off by controlling the system fairness index is applied. In order to do that, two adaptive utility-based resource allocation frameworks consisting of subcarrier assignment and power allocation algorithms are proposed. These frameworks are named utility-based alpha-rule and beta-rule, and are suitable for non-real-time and real-time services, respectively. Not only can both frameworks be designed to work as wellknown classic policies found in the literature, but also as adaptive policies, which are able to meet a desired system fairness target. System level simulations show that the proposed frameworks are powerful tools to the network operator, since they can decide in which trade-off point of the efficiency-fairness plane they want to operate the system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"49","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12216455","htmlLink":"/document/6011739/","displayDocTitle":"Control of the trade-off between resource efficiency and user fairness in wireless networks using utility-based adaptive resource allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of the trade-off between resource efficiency and user fairness in wireless networks using utility-based adaptive resource allocation","sourcePdf":"018RODRIGUESLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057292S","chronDate":"September  2011","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"6011722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"6011722","articleId":"6011739","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6011753,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Nae","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Institute of Information Science and Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Nae","id":"37887721800"},{"name":"Wang Sheng","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Institute of Information Science and Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Sheng","id":"37895963200"},{"name":"Wang Daming","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Institute of Information Science and Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Daming","id":"37887722400"},{"name":"Cui Weijia","affiliation":["Zhengzhou Institute of Information Science and Technology, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Cui","lastName":"Weijia","id":"37541377900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-911-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-910-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-909-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6011753","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":413},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","MIMO","Algorithm design and analysis","OFDM","Fading","Antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","feedback","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser distributed MIMO-OFDM system","limited CSI feedback","centralized system","resource allocation algorithm","multiple input multiple output system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","multiuser Nash bargaining solution-based antenna","subcarrier allocation algorithm","Nash bargaining solution fairness","allocating antenna","limited channel state information feedback","feedback overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed MIMO-OFDM","resource allocation","multi-user","user fairness","limited feedback"]}],"abstract":"Recent academic studies of resource allocation in multiple input multiple output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems is mainly for conventional centralized systems and without considering the characteristics of distributed systems.

The proposed algorithm takes advantages of the structure characteristics of distributed MIMO-OFDM systems and introduces Nash Bargaining Solution Fairness into the resource allocation process, allocating antennas and sub-carriers in parallel via the cooperation between antenna ports and users.

Furthermore, it requires limited channel state information (CSI) feedback rather than all as in most previous algorithms, which can cut down the feedback overhead for the systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource allocation in multi-user distributed MIMO-OFDM systems with limited CSI feedback","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems","doi":"10.1109/CYBER.2011.6011753","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005297/6011752/06011753.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBER.2011.6011753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011752","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011753/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Resource allocation in multi-user distributed MIMO-OFDM systems with limited CSI feedback","conferenceDate":"20-23 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6011753/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12220790","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource allocation in multi-user distributed MIMO-OFDM systems with limited CSI feedback","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"0506attachment.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05063S","chronDate":"20-23 March 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005297","isNumber":"6011752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005297","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6011752","articleId":"6011753","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6011757,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37897207200"},{"name":"Yuan Li Cai","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yuan Li","lastName":"Cai","id":"37402900900"},{"name":"Juan Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Shi","id":"37895154700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-911-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-910-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-909-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6011757","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011757","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Partitioning algorithms","Accuracy","Optimization","Robustness","Stability criteria","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","fault tolerant computing","probability","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ordinal isolation","intelligent outlier detection algorithm","intelligent cyber systems","outlier probability","complexity","fault-tolerant"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["outlier detection","ordinal isolation","k-probable outlier list","uniform partition"]}],"abstract":"Outlier detection plays important roles in intelligent cyber systems, especially for fault-tolerant and adaptive ones. Traditional algorithms always need to evaluate distances or densities, which are very time-consuming. On the increasingly urgent demand for real-time, during past years, various novel algorithms have been proposed. They are much faster, but less stable and accurate. To cope with these problems, with the core idea of ordinal optimization and the `few and different' characteristics of outliers, by introducing the concept of outlier probability, we propose the ordinal isolation algorithm, which extracts outliers in terms of the order of being isolated in a recursive uniform data space partition process. It doesn't need any distance or density evaluating, and the complexity is reduced to O(n). Experiments show that, the CPU time of ordinal isolation increases linearly with linearly growing data sets. Furthermore, compared with recent iForest algorithm, ordinal isolation is about 30 times faster, with 20% to 30% improvement in accuracy, and especially is much more stable. Ordinal isolation also has good scalability, so it works well in high-dimensional data sets which have a huge number of instances and irrelevant attributes.","doi":"10.1109/CYBER.2011.6011757","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005297/6011752/06011757.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBER.2011.6011757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ordinal isolation: An efficient and effective intelligent outlier detection algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 March 2011","displayDocTitle":"Ordinal isolation: An efficient and effective intelligent outlier detection algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"12220794","htmlLink":"/document/6011757/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","conferenceDate":"20-23 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ordinal isolation: An efficient and effective intelligent outlier detection algorithm","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"0530attachment.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064073S","chronDate":"20-23 March 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005297","isNumber":"6011752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005297","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6011752","articleId":"6011757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6011765,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Yang","affiliation":["School of Communications and Information Engineering, Xi''an University of Posts and Telecommunications, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Yang","id":"37594677900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-911-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-910-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-909-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6011765","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011765","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Estimation","Bit error rate","Signal to noise ratio","Multipath channels","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multipath channels","radio receivers","sequences","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE estimation","medium rate communication","cyber sensor network","localization services","UWB transmitted-reference receivers","multipath component segment distribution characteristic","UWB weighted averaged TR receiver","UWB received signals","minimize-mean-square-error estimation","weight coefficients","bit-error-rate","BER performance","training data sequence","IEEE CM3 indoor multipath channel","segmentation-weighting-combination idea","noise product term suppression","time of arrival estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ultra-wideband (UWB) communications","transmitted-reference (TR) receiver","minimize-mean-square-error (MMSE) weight estimation","localization applications"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011752","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Cyber Technology in Automation, Control, and Intelligent Systems","doi":"10.1109/CYBER.2011.6011765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel ultra-wideband weighted ATR receiver based on MMSE estimation for localization applications","startPage":"62","endPage":"66","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005297/6011752/06011765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CYBER.2011.6011765","abstract":"Impulse ultra-wideband (UWB) system has accurate localization as well as low to medium rate communication, so it is especially suitable in many emerging cyber sensor network applications which often need localization services. Due to implementation complexity concerns, UWB transmitted-reference (TR) receivers become a good choice for above applications recently. In this paper, considering the multipath components segment distribution characteristic of UWB received signals, a novel UWB weighted averaged TR receiver based on minimize-mean-square-error (MMSE) estimation is presented by using segmentation-weighting-combination idea. Those segments which hold the intensive multipath signals are given the bigger weight coefficients, so that more useful multipath energy are captured meanwhile the noise product term is highly suppressed, thus the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of the receiver is efficiently improved. The suitable weight coefficients are obtained by using MMSE estimation via training data sequence. This receiver was analyzed in theory and simulated in IEEE CM3 indoor multipath channel. The results show that it has superior detect performance compared with a common averaged TR receiver. The receiver can be used for a lot of cyber sensor network applications with localization capability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 March 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6011765/","accessionNumber":"12220802","displayDocTitle":"A novel ultra-wideband weighted ATR receiver based on MMSE estimation for localization applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel ultra-wideband weighted ATR receiver based on MMSE estimation for localization applications","confLoc":"Kunming, China","sourcePdf":"0596attachment.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057329S","chronDate":"20-23 March 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005297","isNumber":"6011752","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005297","xplore-issue":"6011752","articleId":"6011765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6011775,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Jin","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Jin","id":"37892655900"},{"name":"Shujuan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Shujuan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37405101000"},{"name":"Hongchang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, China"],"firstName":"Hongchang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37539383200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-911-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-910-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-909-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6011775","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Generators","Measurement","Software testing","Transforms","Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","program testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["test data generation","genetic algorithm","program dependence analysis","branch testing","branch selection","control-dependence graph","priority assignment","path selection algorithm","path constraints","fitness function","program coverage","software testing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["test data generation","genetic algorithm","program dependence analysis","branch coverage"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011775","abstract":"A novel approach to generating test data for branch testing is presented.

We estimate the \u201cnormal\u201d trends in the velocities by activity path modeling after scaling the velocities by the vehicle's average speed. We detect an anomaly if a vehicle's velocity does not fall in the available path models. Finally, we use the shape of the trajectory to determine turns and other significant maneuvers. We also detect an anomaly if a vehicle's velocity falls in a path model which is inconsistent with the shape of its trajectory. We observe that our proposed co-ordinate system also improves trajectory shape analysis by suppressing false turns.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2011.6011879","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997811/6011826/06011879.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6011879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-ordinate mapping and analysis of vehicle trajectory for anomaly detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011879/","displayDocTitle":"Co-ordinate mapping and analysis of vehicle trajectory for anomaly detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6011879/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-ordinate mapping and analysis of vehicle trajectory for anomaly detection","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055385S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5997811","isNumber":"6011826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5997811","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6011826","articleId":"6011879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6011884,"authors":[{"name":"Erfan Loweimi","affiliation":["Speech Processing Research Laboratory, Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Erfan","lastName":"Loweimi","id":"37705052400"},{"name":"Seyed Mohammad Ahadi","affiliation":["Speech Processing Research Laboratory, Electrical Engineering Department, Amirkabir University of Technology\uc2a0, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Mohammad","lastName":"Ahadi","id":"37265110300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-350-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-348-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-349-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"6011884","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":187},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Speech","Mel frequency cepstral coefficient","Speech recognition","Feature extraction","Computational modeling","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Robust speech recognition","group delay function","signal modeling","compression"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present a novel feature extraction algorithm based on group delay function for robust speech recognition. The modified group delay function (MODGDF) is the main feature extraction method based on group delay function, generally used for robust speech recognition. The recognition tests indicate this feature does not provide notably better results in the presence of additive noise in comparison with MFCC. In the presence of convolutional noise, the performance of MODGDF is considerably lower than MFCC. The method proposed in this paper is simple and makes more efficient utilization of the high resolution property of GDF. It is formed from three main parts which are signal modeling, GDF computation based on extracted model, and compression. The recognition results obtained over AURORA 2.0 task indicate its superior performance in comparison with MODGDF and MFCC.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2011.6011884","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997811/6011826/06011884.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6011884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011826","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new group delay-based feature for robust speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new group delay-based feature for robust speech recognition","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011884/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6011884/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new group delay-based feature for robust speech recognition","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102988S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5997811","isNumber":"6011826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5997811","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6011826","articleId":"6011884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6011888,"authors":[{"name":"Lu Fang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Fang","id":"37532747600"},{"name":"Oscar C.

To show high resolution image on a lower resolution display, it must then be down-sampled. These two steps influence each other, i.e., the color artifacts introduced in demosaicing may be magnified in subsequent down-sampling process and vice versa. Thanks to the fact that LCD displays are actually composed of separable subpixels, which can be individually addressed to achieve a higher effective apparent resolution. This paper presents an Adaptive Joint Demosaicing and Subpixel-based Down-sampling scheme (AJDSD) for single-sensor camera image, where the subpixel-based down-sampling is adaptively and directly applied in Bayer domain, without the process of demosaicing. Simulation results demonstrate that when compared with conventional \u201cdemosaicing-first and down-sampling-later\u201d methods, AJDSD achieves superior performance improvement in terms of computational complexity. As for visual quality, AJDSD is more effective in preserving high frequency details, leading to much sharper and clearer results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6011888","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997811/6011826/06011888.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2011.6011888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive joint demosaicing and Subpixel-based Down-sampling for Bayer image","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive joint demosaicing and Subpixel-based Down-sampling for Bayer image","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6011888/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011888/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive joint demosaicing and Subpixel-based Down-sampling for Bayer image","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045079S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5997811","isNumber":"6011826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5997811","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6011826","articleId":"6011888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6011919,"authors":[{"name":"Maodong Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Maodong","lastName":"Li","id":"37404567100"},{"name":"Zhenzhong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Zhenzhong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278565300"},{"name":"Yap-Peng Tan","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Yap-Peng","lastName":"Tan","id":"37274878200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-350-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-348-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-349-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"6011919","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"abstract":"We address in this paper the utility maximization of scalable video transmission under limited radio resource in a multi-user, multi-antenna downlink. The proposed utility maximization framework comprises two parts: a utility analysis of scalable video based on approximated rate-distortion function and a resource allocation scheme by joint power allocation and bit loading. Scalable video packets are entitled with differentiated priority due to the inherent dependency relationship in a layer-based encoding scheme. First, we analyze the rate-utility of scalable video by packet prioritization, which plays a key role in video utility maximization under a fixed rate constraint. Then to cater for diverse rate-utility character and time-varying network condition for multiple scalable video downlink over SDMA/OFDMA system, a joint power allocation and bit loading scheme is proposed to increase the overall video utility under limited radio resource. The resource allocation is accomplished by three important procedures, user grouping, bit loading and power adaptation. The performance of the proposed scheme is validated by comparing with conventional radio resource allocation schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997811/6011826/06011919.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2011.6011919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6011919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011826","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint power allocation and bit loading for enhanced SVC video downlink transmissions over SDMA/OFDMA networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Modulation","Loading","Static VAr compensators","Multiaccess communication","Downlink","Joints"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scalable Video","SVC","SDMA/OFDMA","Utility Maximization","Resource Allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6011919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Joint power allocation and bit loading for enhanced SVC video downlink transmissions over SDMA/OFDMA networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6011919/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint power allocation and bit loading for enhanced SVC video downlink transmissions over SDMA/OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067932S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5997811","isNumber":"6011826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5997811","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6011826","articleId":"6011919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6011971,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Min","affiliation":["Department of Multimedia Communications, Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"lastName":"Rui Min","id":"37087992537"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Dugelay","affiliation":["Department of Multimedia Communications, Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Dugelay","id":"37284270400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-350-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-348-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-349-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"6011971","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6011971","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Histograms","Training","Feature extraction","Computer architecture","Lighting"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face Recognition","Local Binary Patterns","Sparse Representation based Classification","Divide and Conquer","Pyramid Architecture"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICME.2011.6011971","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997811/6011826/06011971.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6011971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved combination of LBP and sparse representation based classification (SRC) for face recognition","abstract":"Recently, local binary patterns (LBP) based descriptors and sparse representation based classification (SRC) become both eminent techniques in face recognition.

Previous FER efforts to address occlusion suffer from loss of appearance features and are largely limited to a few occlusion types and single testing strategy. This paper presents a robust approach for FER in occluded images and addresses these issues. A set of Gabor based templates is extracted from images in the gallery using a Monte Carlo algorithm. These templates are converted into distance features using template matching. The resulting feature vectors are robust to occlusion. Occluded eyes and mouth regions and randomly places occlusion patches are used for testing.

Most of the state-of-art particle-based tracking algorithms are challenged due to lacking of a reliable moving object detection and drastic scale along with perspective shift of the target. Therefore, pure intensity based algorithms usually miss the target gradually without other features for correcting target location. Our method learns and maintains a contour template of the target besides intensity. Taking into account both the evolution and sudden change of the pedestrian contour, the proposed tracking algorithm maintains several sets of profiles from different perspectives and evolves them incrementally. The effectiveness of our tracking algorithm with extra contour measurement is tested over several surveillance records captured from PTZ camera and estimates the location more robustly than other cutting edge tracking algorithms compared in our experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6012040/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12301226","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Tracking pedestrians with incremental learned intensity and contour templates for PTZ camera visual surveillance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking pedestrians with incremental learned intensity and contour templates for PTZ camera visual surveillance","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper689.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083502S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5997811","isNumber":"6011826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5997811","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6011826","articleId":"6012040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6012060,"authors":[{"name":"Yoichi Tomioka","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture\uc2a0and\uc2a0Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichi","lastName":"Tomioka","id":"37890636400"},{"name":"Hitoshi Kitazawa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo University of Agriculture\uc2a0and\uc2a0Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hitoshi","lastName":"Kitazawa","id":"37089044702"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-350-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-348-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-349-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"6012060","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012060","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Digital cameras","Correlation","Accuracy","Image sensors","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","feature extraction","image denoising","image sensors","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital camera identification enhancement","clustered pattern noise","image sensors","digital image source identification","pixel nonuniformity noise","PNU noise","feature extraction","random noise","image processing engine","noise reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["camera identification","pixel non-uniformity noise","random noise","clustering","image processing engine"]}],"abstract":"Along with the popularization of digital cameras, the reliable identification of digital image source is becoming increasingly important as an evidence in a court and some help of investigations.

The Markov process model is used to propagate the temporal information between adjacent video frames. The combination of multi-atlas and Markov model provides robust face recognition by taking both spatial and temporal information into account.

The GPU-based home-care surveillance system is effective and has a major impact on health expenditure than traditional surveillance equipments. In this work, we propose a spike sorting technique as a specific case for the GPU-based home surveillance system. Spike sorting is the procedure of classifying spikes corresponding to the firing neurons. In neuroscience research, spike sorting is adopted to analyze neural activities, brain functions and sensation. It is also a key component in cortically-controlled neuro prosthetics for patients. In order to efficiently distinguish different neural spike activities, a robust spike sorting algorithm is required for above applications. To improve accuracy, multi-channel spike sorting is necessary. In addition, real-time monitoring for a home care system is required. Therefore, we exploit a CUDA implementation using GPU for acceleration.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2011.6012081","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997811/6011826/06012081.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6012081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithm and implementation of multi-channel spike sorting using GPU in a home-care surveillance system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012081/","displayDocTitle":"Algorithm and implementation of multi-channel spike sorting using GPU in a home-care surveillance system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12301267","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012081/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm and implementation of multi-channel spike sorting using GPU in a home-care surveillance system","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056524S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5997811","isNumber":"6011826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5997811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6011826","articleId":"6012081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6012096,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago Silva","affiliation":["Instituto das Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es P\u00f3lo de Aveiro, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Tiago","lastName":"Silva","id":"37901625300"},{"name":"Miguel Veiga","affiliation":["Instituto das Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es P\u00f3lo de Aveiro, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Veiga","id":"37901291400"},{"name":"Antonio Navarro","affiliation":["Instituto das Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es P\u00f3lo de Aveiro, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Navarro","id":"37269048600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-350-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-348-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-349-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"6012096","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Decoding","Channel estimation","Wireless communication","PSNR"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H.264 video transmission","OFDM-MIMO communication","multichannel transmission technology","data partitioning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","H.264","Data Partitioning","Diversity","Pilot Symbols"]}],"abstract":"Higher capacity is achieved by using multichannel transmission technology.

The results of our proposed MIMO communication show an improvement of 0.85dB by using a data-partitioning over a SISO case.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2011.6012096","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997811/6011826/06012096.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6012096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"H.264 video transmission oveR 2\u00d72 OFDM-MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012096/","displayDocTitle":"H.264 video transmission oveR 2\u00d72 OFDM-MIMO","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12301282","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012096/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"H.264 video transmission oveR 2\u00d72 OFDM-MIMO","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"paper1036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061329S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5997811","isNumber":"6011826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5997811","xplore-issue":"6011826","articleId":"6012096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6012097,"authors":[{"name":"Guilherme Corr\u00eaa","affiliation":["Informatics Institute, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Guilherme","lastName":"Corr\u00eaa","id":"37666854300"},{"name":"Daniel Palomino","affiliation":["Informatics Institute, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Palomino","id":"37394600300"},{"name":"Cl\u00e1udio Diniz","affiliation":["Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e1udio","lastName":"Diniz","id":"37550679100"},{"name":"Luciano Agostini","affiliation":["Informatics Institute, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Luciano","lastName":"Agostini","id":"37300469400"},{"name":"Sergio Bampi","affiliation":["Informatics Institute, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Bampi","id":"37265059600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-350-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-348-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-349-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"6012097","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Agricultural machinery","Helium","PSNR","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","field programmable gate arrays","heuristic programming","integrated circuit design","optimisation","rate distortion theory","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast inter mode decision","H.264/AVC standard","VLSI design","rate-distortion optimization technique","encoding process","encoder complexity","real time video coding","stationarity heterogeneity and border strength heuristic","SHBS heuristic","FPGA","frequency 118 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mode decision","rate-distortion optimization","inter prediction","H.264/AVC","video coding"]}],"abstract":"In the Rate-Distortion Optimization technique for H.264/AVC, the process of choosing the best mode is performed through exhaustive executions of the whole encoding process, which increases significantly the encoder complexity, sometimes even forbidding its use in real time video coding applications.

In the scheme, generalized brain-state-in-a-box neural network (gBSB) and error diffusion halftoning are employed to extract the robust feature, which is further used to generate the verification information registered to TA, from the original image. Experimental results demonstrate that the feature is adequately robust to make sure that the verifier will be able to extract the logo mark from the attacked image correctly.

Typical methods rely on view synthesis based on depth image based rendering. Our method applies purely image domain warping instead. Input video is analyzed and information about sparse disparity, vertical edges and saliency is extracted. A constrained energy minimization problem is formulated and efficiently solved. The resulting image warping functions are used to synthesize novel views. Our approach is fully automatic, accurate, and reliable. Disocclusions and related artifacts are avoided due to smooth, saliency-driven warping functions. Our method also works well for extrapolation of views in a limited range, thus supporting multiview creation from stereo input, which is the most relevant use case scenario.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2011","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6012182/","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12301362","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Automatic content creation for multiview autostereoscopic displays using image domain warping","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic content creation for multiview autostereoscopic displays using image domain warping","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"wpaper158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042141S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5997811","isNumber":"6011826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5997811","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6011826","articleId":"6012182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6012221,"authors":[{"name":"Laura Toni","affiliation":["TERA Department, Italian Institute of Technology, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Toni","id":"37568248100"},{"name":"Pamela C.

The proposed algorithm outperforms baseline ones which do not take into account the SLV.","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2011.6012221","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997811/6011826/06012221.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6012221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unequal error protection based on slice visibility for transmission of compressed video over OFDM channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012221/","displayDocTitle":"Unequal error protection based on slice visibility for transmission of compressed video over OFDM channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12301400","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012221/","conferenceDate":"11-15 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"06 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unequal error protection based on slice visibility for transmission of compressed video over OFDM channels","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"wpaper277.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052905S","chronDate":"11-15 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5997811","isNumber":"6011826","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5997811","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6011826","articleId":"6012221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6012227,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Bankoski","affiliation":["Google, Inc., CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Bankoski","id":"37891176300"},{"name":"Paul Wilkins","affiliation":["Google, Inc., CA, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Wilkins","id":"37679219600"},{"name":"Yaowu Xu","affiliation":["Google, Inc., CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yaowu","lastName":"Xu","id":"37897045800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-350-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-348-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-349-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1945-7871"}],"articleNumber":"6012227","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":57,"totalDownloads":1212},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012227","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Automatic voltage control","Continuous wavelet transforms","Entropy","Quantization","Information filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","public domain software","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VP8","open source video codec","World Wide Web","open source video compression format"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["VP8","WebM","Video Codec","Web Video"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICME.2011.6012227","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/5997811/6011826/06012227.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6012227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6011826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technical overview of VP8, an open source video codec for the web","abstract":"VP8 is an open source video compression format supported by a consortium of technology companies.

The chip consists of eight neural recording modules where each module contains four neural amplifiers, an analog multiplexer, an A/D converter, and a serial programming interface. Each amplifier can be programmed to record either spikes or LFPs with a programmable gain from 49-66 dB. To minimize the total power consumption, an adaptive-biasing scheme is utilized to adjust each amplifier's input-referred noise to suit the background noise at the recording site. The amplifier's input-referred noise can be adjusted from 11.2 \u03bcV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n (total power of 5.4 \u03bcW) down to 5.4 \u03bcV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n (total power of 20 \u03bcW) in the spike-recording setting. The ADC in each recording module digitizes the a.c. signal input to each amplifier at 8-bit precision with a sampling rate of 31.25 kS/s per channel, with an average power consumption of 483 nW per channel, and, because of a.c. coupling, allows d.c. operation over a wide dynamic range. It achieves an ENOB of 7.65, resulting in a net efficiency of 77 fJ/State, making it one of the most energy-efficient designs for neural recording applications.

This dithering renders the digital phase detector, realized as a time-to-digital converter (TDC), free from any phase domain spurious tones generated as a consequence of an ill-conditioned sampling of the feedback variable oscillator phase. In modern nanoscale technologies, TDC has a time quantization of 5 to 30 ps. This deadband can potentially result in spurious tones, whenever a near integer-N relationship arises between the oscillator frequency and the TDC sampling process. This work proposes injection of a spectrum-friendly short sequence dither into the reference clock signal to overcome the quantization introduced limit-cycles. This results in robust phase tracking performance and spurious-free operation of the ADPLL, which was verified in a 65-nm CMOS GSM/EDGE transmitter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012495/","volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6012495/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12227992","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Spurious-Free Time-to-Digital Conversion in an ADPLL Using Short Dithering Sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spurious-Free Time-to-Digital Conversion in an ADPLL Using Short Dithering Sequences","sourcePdf":"tcsi-waheed-2163981-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087784S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6016553","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6016553","articleId":"6012495","onlineDate":"08 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6012496,"authors":[{"name":"Fan Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6016553/6012496/6012496-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fan Zhang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California at Berkeley in 2007 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 2009.

This is established by using lattice programming and stochastic orders in a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) framework. A stochastic gradient algorithm is presented to estimate the optimal linear approximation to this threshold curve. We illustrate these results by first considering quickest time detection with phase-type distributed change time and a variance stopping penalty. Then it is proved that the threshold switching curve also arises in several other Bayesian decision problems such as quickest transient detection, exponential delay (risk-sensitive) penalties, stopping time problems in social learning, and multi-agent scheduling in a changing world. Using Blackwell dominance, it is shown that for dynamic decision making problems, the optimal decision policy is lower bounded by a myopic policy. Finally, it is shown how the achievable cost of the optimal decision policy varies with change time distribution by imposing a partial order on transition matrices.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6034704/06012525.pdf","startPage":"7096","endPage":"7124","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2165152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2165152","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6034704","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bayesian Sequential Detection With Phase-Distributed Change Time and Nonlinear Penalty\u2014A POMDP Lattice Programming Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Markov processes","Bayesian methods","Delay","Transient analysis","Lattices","Programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Bayes methods","decision making","Markov processes","signal detection","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayesian sequential detection","phase-distributed change time","nonlinear penalty","POMDP lattice programming approach","partial observed Markov decision process","stochastic gradient algorithm","blackwell dominance","dynamic decision making problem","myopic policy","transition matrices","time distribution","optimal linear approximation","posterior distribution","threshold switching curve structure","time detection","social learning","multiagent scheduling","transient detection","exponential delay penalties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blackwell dominance","exponential delay penalty","lattice programming","monotone likelihood ratio ordering","multi-agent decision making","POMDP","quickest time change detection","social learning","stochastic dominance","transient detection","variance penalty"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bayesian Sequential Detection With Phase-Distributed Change Time and Nonlinear Penalty\u2014A POMDP Lattice Programming Approach","volume":"57","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12287700","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bayesian Sequential Detection With Phase-Distributed Change Time and Nonlinear Penalty\u2014A POMDP Lattice Programming Approach","sourcePdf":"tit-krishnamurthy-2165152-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074628S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6034704","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"42","articleId":"6012525","onlineDate":"08 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6012526,"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Kuppinger","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Patrick Kuppinger (S'07) was born in Freiburg, Germany, on May 5, 1983.

Essentially, it repeatedly applies bounded-distance decoding upon combinatorially flipping certain least reliable bits (or patterns for nonbinary case). In this paper, we devise a one-pass Chase decoding algorithm of Reed-Solomon codes such that the desired error locator polynomial by flipping an error pattern is obtained in one pass (when operated in parallel) through utilizing the preceding results. This is effectively achieved through cumulative interpolation and linear-feedback-shift-register (LFSR) synthesis techniques. Furthermore, through converting the algorithm into the transform domain, exhaustive root search for each error locator polynomial is circumvented. Computationally, the new algorithm exhibits linear complexity , in attempting to determine a candidate codeword associated with each additionally flipped symbol/pattern; it compares favorably to quadratic complexity by straightforwardly utilizing hard-decision decoding, where and denote the code length and minimum distance, respectively. We also reveal a corrected algorithm for one-pass generalized minimum distance (GMD) decoding for Reed-Solomon codes from Koetter's original work. In addition, we devise a highly efficient one-pass Chase decoding algorithm for binary Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes by taking advantage of a key characteristic of the Berlekamp algorithm. Finally, we present a systolic very large-scale integration (VLSI) decoder architecture through slightly compromising the proposed one-pass Chase decoding algorithm. It takes clock cycles to complete one iteration by flipping one error pattern. Both circuit and memory complexities are dictated by the dimension of flipping patterns; in particular, they are independent of the code length or the minimum distance , rendering it highly attractive for various applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012528/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","volume":"58","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12443702","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2012","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6012528/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast Chase Decoding Algorithms and Architectures for Reed\u2013Solomon Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Chase Decoding Algorithms and Architectures for Reed\u2013Solomon Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-wu-2165524-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132908S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6121971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6121971","articleId":"6012528","onlineDate":"08 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6012531,"authors":[{"name":"Kuiyuan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6155180/6012531/6012531-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kuiyuan Wu received the B.S. degree from Southwest Jiao Tong University, Chengdu, China, in 1990, and the M.S. degrees from Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1997, and The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2008, all in electrical engineering.

Nonlinear and periodic operation of the bidirectional converter is presented including the control circuit. Using the working theory, the converter operation is separated into several stages. Equivalent circuits and state equations are developed for each stage. The Lyapunov function method is used to determine the stability of the converter in every stage. Justification is provided for the absence of abrupt changes of the state variables or infinite noise at the interface of different stages. The stability of the bidirectional converter is determined theoretically by integrating these concepts.

Specifically, in the proposed DIKE scheme, we first introduce a privacy-preserving authentication technique that not only provides the vehicle user's anonymous authentication but enables double-registration detection as well. We then present efficient LBS session key update procedures: 1) We divide the session of an LBS into several time slots so that each time slot holds a different session key; when no vehicle user departs from the service session, each joined user can use a one-way hash function to autonomously update the new session key for achieving forward secrecy. 2) We also integrate a novel dynamic threshold technique in traditional vehicle-to-vehicle (V-2-V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V-2-I) communications to achieve the session key's backward secrecy, i.e., when a vehicle user departs from the service session, more than a threshold number of joined users can cooperatively update the new session key. Performance evaluations via extensive simulations demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed DIKE scheme in terms of low key update delay and fast key update ratio.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2011.2164068","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6979/6157683/06012553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2011.2164068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6157683","startPage":"127","endPage":"139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dynamic Privacy-Preserving Key Management Scheme for Location-Based Services in VANETs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012553","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Dynamic Privacy-Preserving Key Management Scheme for Location-Based Services in VANETs","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012553/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12557741","dateOfInsertion":"27 February 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6012553/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dynamic Privacy-Preserving Key Management Scheme for Location-Based Services in VANETs","sourcePdf":"tits-lu-2164068-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09372S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"6157683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"6157683","articleId":"6012553","onlineDate":"08 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6012688,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Syu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Syu","id":"37889765200"},{"name":"Yong-Yi FanJiang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yong-Yi","lastName":"FanJiang","id":"37329512600"},{"name":"Jong-Yih Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jong-Yih","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37275496500"},{"name":"Shang-Pin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shang-Pin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37406093500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0879-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4461-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-3818"}],"articleNumber":"6012688","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012688","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Biological cells","Quality of service","Noise measurement","Materials","Service oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","quality of service","software engineering","Web design","Web services","workflow management software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS awareness","service oriented architecture","software development","Web service","Web design phase","workflow composition","transaction aware service","executable workflow","automatic composition approach","genetic algorithm","user functional requirements","QoS criteria"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web Services Composition","Genetic Algorithm","Transactional Web Service","Quality of Service"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2011.68","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011825/6012651/06012688.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE World Congress on Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE World Congress on Services","startPage":"295","endPage":"302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012651","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2011.68","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards a Genetic Algorithm Approach to Automating Workflow Composition for Web Services with Transactional and QoS-Awareness","abstract":"Service-oriented architecture implemented by Web Services is one of the most popular and promising software development paradigm that has brought some challenging research issues today. One of the most important issues is how to automate web service composition at design phase. Currently, there are many researchers concentrating on service composition problem that can be partitioned into three parts, dynamic workflow composition, QoS-aware, and transaction-aware service selection. This paper addresses the issue of automatic composing Web Services into an executable workflow not only according to user's functional requirements but also to their transactional properties and QoS characteristics. We propose an automatic composition approach through genetic algorithm to satisfy user's functional requirements, QoS criteria, and transactional requirements automatically at the same time.

A real time system can take advantage of intensive computing capabilities and scalable virtualized environment of cloud computing to execute real time tasks. In most of the real time cloud applications, processing is done on remote cloud computing nodes. So there are more chances of errors, due to the undetermined latency and loose control over computing node. On the other side, most of the real time systems are also safety critical and should be highly reliable. So there is an increased requirement for fault tolerance to achieve reliability for the real time computing on cloud infrastructure. In this paper, a fault tolerance model for real time cloud computing is proposed. In the proposed model, the system tolerates the faults and makes the decision on the basis of reliability of the processing nodes, i.e. virtual machines. The reliability of the virtual machines is adaptive, which changes after every computing cycle. If a virtual machine manages to produce a correct result within the time limit, its reliability increases. And if it fails to produce the result within time or correct result, its reliability decreases. A metric model is given for the reliability assessment. In the model, decrease in reliability is more than increase. If the node continues to fail, it is removed, and a new node is added. There is also a minimum reliability level. If any processing node does not achieve that level, the systems will perform backward recovery or safety measures. The proposed technique is based on the execution of design diverse variants on multiple virtual machines, and assigning reliability to the results produced by variants. The virtual machine instances can be of same type or of different types. The system provides both the forward and backward recovery mechanism, but main focus is on forward recovery. The main essence of the proposed technique is the adaptive behavior of the reliability weights assigned to each processing node and adding and removing of nodes on the basis of reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012725/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220003","htmlLink":"/document/6012725/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fault Tolerance in Real Time Cloud Computing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fault Tolerance in Real Time Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4461a280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054691S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011825","isNumber":"6012651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011825","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"6012651","articleId":"6012725","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6012735,"authors":[{"name":"Damian A.

Cloud computing's high flexibility needs novel software engineering approaches, and technologies to deliver agile, flexible, scalable yet secure software solutions with full technical (e.g. QoS, service continuity etc.) and business gain (e.g. profit, corporate value, utility etc.). Agile Service Networks are themselves an emerging paradigm envisioning collaborative and dynamic service interactions (network edges) among global service-oriented applications (network nodes). We argue that Agile Service Networks can be used as a paradigm for software engineering in the cloud, since they are indeed able to deliver solutions which are both compliant to the cloud's needs and able to harness it, bringing about its full potential.

Finally, we sketch a set of steps that can be used, at a high level, to assess security preparedness for a business application to be migrated to cloud.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud Computing Security--Trends and Research Directions","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE World Congress on Services","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2011.20","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE World Congress on Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011825/6012651/06012787.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2011.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012651","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012787","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Cloud Computing Security--Trends and Research Directions","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012787/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220027","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud Computing Security--Trends and Research Directions","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4461a524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054676S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011825","isNumber":"6012651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011825","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6012651","articleId":"6012787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6012790,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Duan","affiliation":["Information Science and Technology Department, Abington College, Pennsylvania State University, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Duan","id":"37273377100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0879-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4461-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-3818"}],"articleNumber":"6012790","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1821},"abstract":"Computer networks play a crucial role in Cloud service provisioning and network Quality of Service (QoS) has a significant impact on Cloud service performance. Therefore networking and Clouding computing systems should be modeled and analyzed as a composite service provisioning system in order to obtain thorough understanding about the user's perception of Cloud service performance. Network virtualization is one of the latest developments in the networking area, which de-couples networking services from network infrastructures. The Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) serves as a key enabler in both network virtualization and Cloud computing, thus offering a promising basis for network and Cloud composition. The research work presented in this paper investigates application of SOA in network virtualization for composing network and Cloud services, and analyzes the achievable performance of composite network-Cloud service provisioning. This paper proposes a SOA-based network virtualization paradigm, describes a service-oriented framework for composing network and Cloud services, proposes a new approach to modeling service capabilities of composite network - Cloud service provisioning systems, and develops analysis techniques for determining the performance that can be offered by composite network -- Cloud services to their end users.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE World Congress on Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011825/6012651/06012790.pdf","startPage":"548","endPage":"555","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE World Congress on Services","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2011.10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2011.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012651","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Performance Analysis on Network Virtualization for Composite Network-Cloud Service Provisioning","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Service oriented architecture","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Quality of service","Indium phosphide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer networks","quality of service","service-oriented architecture","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","network virtualization","composite network-cloud service provisioning","computer networks","quality of service","cloud service performance","cloud computing systems","composite service provisioning system","service-oriented architecture","cloud composition","cloud services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service-oriented architecture","network virtualization","Cloud computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Performance Analysis on Network Virtualization for Composite Network-Cloud Service Provisioning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012790/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220030","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"4-9 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Performance Analysis on Network Virtualization for Composite Network-Cloud Service Provisioning","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"4461a548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067456S","chronDate":"4-9 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011825","isNumber":"6012651","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011825","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6012651","articleId":"6012790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6012792,"authors":[{"name":"P.V.G.D.

Yu et al recently proposed a centralized fine grained data access control mechanism for sensor networks, which exploits a cryptographic primitive called attribute based encryption (ABE). There is only one trusted authority to distribute keys to the sensor nodes and the users. Compromising the single authority can undermine the whole network. We propose a fully distributed access control method, which has several authorities instead of one. Each sensor has a set of attributes and each user has an access structure of attributes. A message from a sensor is encrypted such that only a user with matching set of attributes can decrypt. Compared to, our schemes need simpler access structure which make secret key distribution more computation efficient, when user rights are modified.

Groups of threads - called warps and wave fronts, respectively, in nVidia and AMD literature - are selected by the hardware scheduler and executed in lockstep on the available cores. If threads in such a group access the slow off-chip global memory, the entire group has to be stalled, and another group is scheduled instead. The utilization of a given multiprocessor will remain high if there is a sufficient number of alternative thread groups to select from. Many parallel general purpose applications have been efficiently mapped to GPUs. Unfortunately, many stream processing applications exhibit unfavorable data movement patterns and low computation-to-communication ratio that may lead to poor performance. In this paper, we describe an automated compilation flow that maps most stream processing applications onto GPUs by taking into consideration two important architectural features of nVidia GPUs, namely interleaved execution as well as the small amount of shared memory available in each streaming multiprocessors. In particular, we show that using a small number of compute threads such that the memory footprint is reduced, we can achieve high utilization of the GPU cores. Our scheme goes against the conventional wisdom of GPU programming which is to use a large number of homogeneous threads. Instead, it uses a mix of compute and memory access threads, together with a carefully crafted schedule that exploits parallelism in the streaming application, while maximizing the effectiveness of the unique memory hierarchy. We have implemented our scheme in the compiler of the Stream It programming language, and our results show a significant speedup compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.52","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012816.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.52","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","startPage":"467","endPage":"478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated Architecture-Aware Mapping of Streaming Applications Onto GPUs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automated Architecture-Aware Mapping of Streaming Applications Onto GPUs","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012816/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12220860","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6012816/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Architecture-Aware Mapping of Streaming Applications Onto GPUs","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385a467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064549S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012816","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6012836,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37291220700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-372-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4385-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6012836","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":490},"abstract":"Folded-Clos networks, also referred to as fat-trees, have been widely used as interconnects in large scale high performance computing clusters.

Based on cryptography, many schemes for preventing prefix hijacks have been proposed. Securing binding between IP prefix and its owner underlies these schemes. We believe that a scheme for securing this binding should try to satisfy these seven critical requirements: no key escrow, no other secure channel, defending against Malicious Key Issuer (MKI) in the phase of prefix announcement, defending against MKI in the phase of key issuing, no certificate, in-band delegation attestation, and in-band public key witness. In this paper, we propose a new scheme, Origin Authentication based on Self-Certified public keys (SC-OA), using self-certified public keys to authenticate origin autonomous systems. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work for securing prefix ownership using self-certified public keys to achieve an efficient and secure scheme that satisfies all seven requirements. The analyses show that SC-OA can defend against regular prefix, sub prefix, unassigned prefix, interception-based, and MKI hijacking, and improve performance in many aspects. It will be pushed ahead to practical deployment for preventing prefix hijacks.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.32","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.32","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012841.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012841/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"SC-OA: A Secure and Efficient Scheme for Origin Authentication of Interdomain Routing in Cloud Computing Networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12220883","htmlLink":"/document/6012841/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SC-OA: A Secure and Efficient Scheme for Origin Authentication of Interdomain Routing in Cloud Computing Networks","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385a243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100896S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012841","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6012857,"authors":[{"name":"Edans Flavius de O.

It is thus an important problem in Bioinformatics. So far, aligning huge sequences, such as whole chromosomes, with exact methods has been regarded as unfeasible, due to huge computing and memory requirements. However, high performance computing platforms such as GPUs are being able to change this scenario, making it possible to obtain the exact result for huge sequences in reasonable time. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a parallel algorithm that uses GPU to align huge sequences, executing the Smith-Waterman algorithm combined with Myers-Miller, with linear space complexity. In order to achieve that, we propose optimizations that are able to reduce significantly the amount of data processed and that enforce full parallelism most of the time. Using the GTX 285 Board, our algorithm was able to produce the optimal alignment between sequences composed of 33 Millions of Base Pairs (MBP) and 47 MBP in 18.5 hours.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.114","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012857.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smith-Waterman Alignment of Huge Sequences with GPU in Linear Space","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012857","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smith-Waterman Alignment of Huge Sequences with GPU in Linear Space","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012857/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12220899","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6012857/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smith-Waterman Alignment of Huge Sequences with GPU in Linear Space","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385b199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096863S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012857","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6012858,"authors":[{"name":"Shucai Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Shucai","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37404042500"},{"name":"Heshan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Heshan","lastName":"Lin","id":"37405078100"},{"name":"Wu-chun Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Wu-chun","lastName":"Feng","id":"37280036100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-372-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4385-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6012858","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating Protein Sequence Search in a Heterogeneous Computing System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Instruction sets","Databases","Kernel","Proteins","Computer architecture","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","genomics","proteins","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protein sequence search","heterogeneous computing system","basic local alignment search tool","bioinformatics","genomic sequence databases","BLASTP"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012858","abstract":"The \"Basic Local Alignment Search Tool'' (BLAST) is arguably the most widely used computational tool in bioinformatics.

We present a code generation and auto-tuning framework \\textsc{Patus} for stencil computations targeted at multi- and many core processors, such as multicore CPUs and graphics processing units, which makes it possible to generate compute kernels from a specification of the stencil operation and a parallelization and optimization strategy, and leverages the auto tuning methodology to optimize strategy-dependent parameters for the given hardware architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PATUS: A Code Generation and Autotuning Framework for Parallel Iterative Stencil Computations on Modern Microarchitectures","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.70","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012879.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"PATUS: A Code Generation and Autotuning Framework for Parallel Iterative Stencil Computations on Modern Microarchitectures","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012879/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12220921","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PATUS: A Code Generation and Autotuning Framework for Parallel Iterative Stencil Computations on Modern Microarchitectures","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385a676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123565S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"149","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012879","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6012886,"authors":[{"name":"Ciprian Docan","affiliation":["Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ciprian","lastName":"Docan","id":"37393846100"},{"name":"Manish Parashar","affiliation":["Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Parashar","id":"37269279100"},{"name":"Julian Cummings","affiliation":["California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Cummings","id":"37393019400"},{"name":"Scott Klasky","affiliation":["Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Klasky","id":"37267815000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-372-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4385-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6012886","dbTime":"37 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":297},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012886","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Servers","Couplings","Data visualization","Computational modeling","Data models","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","data handling","input-output programs","workflow management software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic code deployment","active spaces","scientific simulation","engineering simulation","leadership-class resource","computing node","consumer node","I/O operation","staging area","data-processing code","programming support","data-processing routine","run-time mechanism","binary code","Cray XT5","workflow","data processing"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.120","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012886.pdf","startPage":"758","endPage":"769","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving the Code to the Data - Dynamic Code Deployment Using ActiveSpaces","abstract":"Managing the large volumes of data produced by emerging scientific and engineering simulations running on leadership-class resources has become a critical challenge. The data has to be extracted off the computing nodes and transported to consumer nodes so that it can be processed, analyzed, visualized, archived, etc. Several recent research efforts have addressed data-related challenges at different levels. One attractive approach is to offload expensive I/O operations to a smaller set of dedicated computing nodes known as a staging area. However, even using this approach, the data still has to be moved from the staging area to consumer nodes for processing, which continues to be a bottleneck. In this paper, we investigate an alternate approach, namely moving the data-processing code to the staging area rather than moving the data. Specifically, we present the Active Spaces framework, which provides (1) programming support for defining the data-processing routines to be downloaded to the staging area, and (2) run-time mechanisms for transporting binary codes associated with these routines to the staging area, executing the routines on the nodes of the staging area, and returning the results. We also present an experimental performance evaluation of Active Spaces using applications running on the Cray XT5 at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Finally, we use a coupled fusion application workflow to explore the trade-offs between transporting data and transporting the code required for data processing during coupling, and we characterize the sweet spots for each option.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012886/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12220928","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012886/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Moving the Code to the Data - Dynamic Code Deployment Using ActiveSpaces","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving the Code to the Data - Dynamic Code Deployment Using ActiveSpaces","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385a758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060619S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6012889,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37293324200"},{"name":"Xian-He Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Xian-He","lastName":"Sun","id":"37276409100"},{"name":"Rajeev Thakur","affiliation":["Mathematics and Computer Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Rajeev","lastName":"Thakur","id":"37284796600"},{"name":"Philip C.

The poor I/O performance has been attributed as a critical cause of the low sustained performance of parallel systems. Collective I/O is widely considered a critical solution that exploits the correlation among I/O accesses from multiple processes of a parallel application and optimizes the I/O performance. However, the conventional collective I/O strategy makes the optimization decision based on the logical file layout to avoid multiple file system calls and does not take the physical data layout into consideration. On the other hand, the physical data layout in fact decides the actual I/O access locality and concurrency. In this study, we propose a new collective I/O strategy that is aware of the underlying physical data layout. We confirm that the new Layout-Aware Collective I/O (LACIO) improves the performance of current parallel I/O systems effectively with the help of noncontiguous file system calls. It holds promise in improving the I/O performance for parallel systems.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012889.pdf","startPage":"794","endPage":"804","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.79","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LACIO: A New Collective I/O Strategy for Parallel I/O Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"LACIO: A New Collective I/O Strategy for Parallel I/O Systems","htmlLink":"/document/6012889/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12220931","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LACIO: A New Collective I/O Strategy for Parallel I/O Systems","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385a794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122117S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6012895,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroyuki Takizawa","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Takizawa","id":"37591128700"},{"name":"Kentaro Koyama","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kentaro","lastName":"Koyama","id":"37891438300"},{"name":"Katsuto Sato","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuto","lastName":"Sato","id":"37676765900"},{"name":"Kazuhiko Komatsu","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiko","lastName":"Komatsu","id":"37681423600"},{"name":"Hiroaki Kobayashi","affiliation":["University of Tohoku, Sendai, Miyagi, Japan","CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroaki","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37350375800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-372-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4385-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6012895","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":583},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Checkpointing","Benchmark testing","Kernel","Synchronization","Runtime","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","checkpointing","computer graphic equipment","coprocessors","message passing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CheCL","process migration","transparent checkpoint-restart tool","GPU computing","OpenCL application program","API call","API proxy","MPI applications","CPU"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012895","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new transparent checkpoint/restart (CPR) tool, named CheCL, for high-performance and dependable GPU computing. CheCL can perform CPR on an OpenCL application program without any modification and recompilation of its code. A conventional check pointing system fails to checkpoint a process if the process uses OpenCL. Therefore, in CheCL, every API call is forwarded to another process called an API proxy, and the API proxy invokes the API function, two processes, an application process and an API proxy, are launched for an OpenCL application. In this case, as the application process is not an OpenCL process but a standard process, it can be safely check pointed. While CheCL intercepts all API calls, it records the information necessary for restoring OpenCL objects. The application process does not hold any OpenCL handles, but CheCL handles to keep such information. Those handles are automatically converted to OpenCL handles and then passed to API functions. Upon restart, OpenCL objects are automatically restored based on the recorded information. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of transparent check pointing of OpenCL programs including MPI applications, and quantitatively evaluates the runtime overheads. It is also discussed that CheCL can enable process migration of OpenCL applications among distinct nodes, and among different kinds of compute devices such as a CPU and a GPU.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.85","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012895.pdf","startPage":"864","endPage":"876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CheCL: Transparent Checkpointing and Process Migration of OpenCL Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CheCL: Transparent Checkpointing and Process Migration of OpenCL Applications","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12220937","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012895/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012895/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CheCL: Transparent Checkpointing and Process Migration of OpenCL Applications","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385a864.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081342S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6012898,"authors":[{"name":"Ananta Tiwari","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ananta","lastName":"Tiwari","id":"38468604600"},{"name":"Jeffrey K.

Exploiting all resources of a hybrid accelerators-based node at their maximum potential is thus a fundamental step towards exascale computing. In this article, we present the design of a highly efficient QR factorization for such a node. Our method is in three steps. The first step consists of expressing the QR factorization as a sequence of tasks of well chosen granularity that will aim at being executed on a CPU core or a GPU. We show that we can efficiently adapt high-level algorithms from the literature that were initially designed for homogeneous multicore architectures. The second step consists of designing the kernels that implement each individual task. We use CPU kernels from previous work and present new kernels for GPUs that complement kernels already available in the MAGMA library. We show the impact on performance of these GPU kernels. In particular, we present the benefits of new hybrid CPU/GPU kernels. The last step consists of scheduling these tasks on the computational units. We present two alternative approaches, respectively based on static and dynamic scheduling. In the case of static scheduling, we exploit the a priori knowledge of the schedule to perform successive optimizations leading to very high performance. We, however, highlight the lack of portability of this approach and its limitations to relatively simple algorithms on relatively homogeneous nodes. Alternatively, by relying on an efficient runtime system, Star PU, in charge of ensuring data availability and coherency, we can schedule more complex algorithms on complex heterogeneous nodes with much higher productivity. In this latter case, we show that we can achieve high performance in a portable way thanks to a fine interaction between the application and the runtime system. We demonstrate that the obtained performance is very close to the theoretical upper bounds that we obtained using Linear Programming.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.90","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012902.pdf","startPage":"932","endPage":"943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.90","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QR Factorization on a Multicore Node Enhanced with Multiple GPU Accelerators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012902","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012902/","displayDocTitle":"QR Factorization on a Multicore Node Enhanced with Multiple GPU Accelerators","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12220943","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012902/","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QR Factorization on a Multicore Node Enhanced with Multiple GPU Accelerators","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385a932.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078629S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012902","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6012910,"authors":[{"name":"Jaideep Moses","affiliation":["Intel, USA"],"firstName":"Jaideep","lastName":"Moses","id":"37272511800"},{"name":"Ravi Iyer","affiliation":["Intel, USA"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Iyer","id":"37065928100"},{"name":"Ramesh Illikkal","affiliation":["Intel, USA"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Illikkal","id":"37272510400"},{"name":"Sadagopan Srinivasan","affiliation":["Intel, USA"],"firstName":"Sadagopan","lastName":"Srinivasan","id":"37400610000"},{"name":"Konstantinos Aisopos","affiliation":["Princeton University, USA"],"firstName":"Konstantinos","lastName":"Aisopos","id":"37644308000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-372-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4385-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-2075"},{"format":"CD","value":"1530-2075"}],"articleNumber":"6012910","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1014},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Throughput","Servers","Quality of service","Measurement","Virtual machining","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","data mining","quality of service","transaction processing","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared resource monitoring","throughput optimization","cloud-computing data centers","platform resource usage efficiency","multiple virtual machines","quality of service","QoS","shared cache contention","online transaction processing workloads","SPECjbb","SPECjAppServer","middle-tier workloads","financial workloads","server consolidation"]}],"abstract":"Many data centers employ server consolidation to maximize the efficiency of platform resource usage. As a result, multiple virtual machines (VMs) simultaneously run on each data center platform. Contention for shared resources between these virtual machines has an undesirable and non-deterministic impact on their performance behavior in such platforms. This paper proposes the use of shared resource monitoring to (a) understand the resource usage of each virtual machine on each platform, (b) collect resource usage and performance across different platforms to correlate implications of usage to performance, and (c) migrate VMs that are resource-constrained to improve overall data center throughput and improve Quality of Service (QoS). We focus our efforts on monitoring and addressing shared cache contention and propose a new optimization metric that captures the priority of the VM and the overall weighted throughput of the data center. We conduct detailed experiments emulating data center scenarios including on-line transaction processing workloads (based on TPC-C) middle-tier workloads (based on SPECjbb and SPECjAppServer) and financial workloads (based on PARSEC). We show that monitoring shared resource contention (such as shared cache) is highly beneficial to better manage throughput and QoS in a cloud-computing data center environment.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.98","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012910.pdf","startPage":"1024","endPage":"1033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared Resource Monitoring and Throughput Optimization in Cloud-Computing Datacenters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012910/","displayDocTitle":"Shared Resource Monitoring and Throughput Optimization in Cloud-Computing Datacenters","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6012910/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12220951","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shared Resource Monitoring and Throughput Optimization in Cloud-Computing Datacenters","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385b024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074714S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6012914,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff A.

To better utilize the GPU, we modify MapReduce by combining large amounts of map and reduce items into chunks and using partial reductions and accumulation.

We run these benchmarks on a GPU cluster and achieve desirable speedup and efficiency for all benchmarks. We compare our implementation to the current-best GPU-MapReduce library (runs only on a solo GPU) and a highly-optimized multi-core MapReduce to show the power of GPMR. We demonstrate how typical MapReduce tasks are easily modified to fit into GPMR and leverage a GPU cluster. We highlight how total and relative amounts of communication affect GPMR.

Existing solutions that employ the deduplication technology for cloud backup services only focus on removing redundant data from transmission during backup operations to reduce the backup time, while paying little attention to the restore time that we argue is an important aspect and affects the overall quality of service of the cloud backup services. In this paper, we propose a CAusality Based deduplication performance booster for both cloud backup and restore operations, called CABdedupe, which captures the causal relationship among chronological versions of datasets that are processed in multiple backups/restores, to remove the unmodified data from transmission during not only backup operations but also restore operations, thus to improve both the backup and restore performances. CABdedupe is a middleware that is orthogonal to and can be integrated into any existing backup system. Our extensive experiments, where we integrate CABdedupe into two existing backup systems and feed real world datasets, show that both the backup time and restore time are significantly reduced, with a reduction ratio of up to 103 : 1.","doi":"10.1109/IPDPS.2011.76","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Parallel & Distributed Processing Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/6011824/6012804/06012934.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2011.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6012804","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1277","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CABdedupe: A Causality-Based Deduplication Performance Booster for Cloud Backup Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6012934","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CABdedupe: A Causality-Based Deduplication Performance Booster for Cloud Backup Services","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6012934/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12220963","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6012934/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CABdedupe: A Causality-Based Deduplication Performance Booster for Cloud Backup Services","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"4385b266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077602S","chronDate":"16-20 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6011824","isNumber":"6012804","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6011824","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6012804","articleId":"6012934","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6013045,"authors":[{"name":"Shanshan Wang","affiliation":["College of Life Science and Technology, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Shanshan Wang","id":"37599719300"},{"name":"Qiegen Liu","affiliation":["College of Life Science and Technology, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Qiegen Liu","id":"37673906600"},{"name":"Jianhua Luo","affiliation":["College of Life Science and Technology, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jianhua Luo","id":"37366453700"},{"name":"Yuemin Zhu","affiliation":["CREATIS; CNRS UMR 5220; Inserm U630 INSA Lyon, University of Lyon I, Villeurbanne, France"],"lastName":"Yuemin Zhu","id":"37310651300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-276-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-274-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6013045","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Filtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image denoising","image enhancement","image reconstruction","random noise","recursive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid compressed sensing image reconstruction","weighted recursive filtering procedure","iteration","random noise","reweighted denoising filter","block matching 3D filter","multiscale continuation filter","K-space data","image quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spatially adaptive image denoising filter","BM3D","bilateral filtering","compressed sensing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a hybrid approach of image reconstruction from highly incomplete data is introduced.

First the basic principle of G-S algorithm is clarified, G-S algorithm is given, and based on traditional algorithm, an improved G-S adaptive beamforming algorithm is proposed. The improved algorithm can remove the target signals from received signals and just leave the jamming signals to be orthogonalized, prevent that target signals are treated as jamming signals.

Experimental simulations show that the new method is valid, efficient, and easy to implement in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronics and Optoelectronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005298/6013156/06013258.pdf","startPage":"V2-366","endPage":"V2-369","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 2011 International Conference on Electronics and Optoelectronics","doi":"10.1109/ICEOE.2011.6013258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICEOE.2011.6013258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6013156","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6013258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method of blind source separation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation method","signal energy property","generalized eigenvalue theory","matrix theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["blind source separation","signal energy change degrees","Raleigh Entropy","generalized eigenvalue"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6013258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"A method of blind source separation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6013258/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12221488","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method of blind source separation","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"rp102Vol2c0734.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04178S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005298","isNumber":"6013156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005298","xplore-issue":"6013156","articleId":"6013258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6013266,"authors":[{"name":"Dechun Lv","affiliation":["Institute of electronic engineering, China Academy of Engineering and Physics, Mianyang, China"],"lastName":"Dechun Lv","id":"37679234300"},{"name":"Guangyu Yang","affiliation":["Institute of electronic engineering, China Academy of Engineering and Physics, Mianyang, China"],"lastName":"Guangyu Yang","id":"37895932800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-276-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-275-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-274-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6013266","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability","Gold","Lead","Silicon","Packaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium","field programmable gate arrays","gold","integrated circuit interconnections","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gold bonding reliability","high density FPGA devices","intermetallic mass","gold bonded aluminum pads","reliable bonds","Au-Al"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gold Bonding","FPGA","reliability"]}],"abstract":"The formation of intermetallic mass along the edge of the ball has been observed inherent to the gold bonded Aluminum pads.

The parameters of the PID controller are optimized by using genetic algorithm. The intelligent PID controller based on genetic algorithm is realized by using FPGA. During the realization process, the functional modules of the system are divided based on top-down design method. Each module of the system is described with VHDL language. Finally, the closed loop tests of the intelligent PID controller based on FPGA and genetic algorithm are implemented by means of DSP Builder and Matlab/Simulink. Simulation results have shown that the design method of the intelligent PID controller based on FPGA and genetic algorithm is verified, and it has some advantages such as design flexible, self-tuning on line, high reliability, short cycle of technical development, high running speed and so on.

It is proved in the literature that by using the simplified method, the transmitter only considering all-zeros codeword suffices to elaborate the error performance compared with the entire encode-decode system. Simulation results show that conventional LDPC coded BICM-ID system and the simplified all-zeros model have the same expected decoder behavior.

However, the complexity of traditional sphere decoding algorithm is still relatively high. To solve the above difficult problems, some improvements are made based on the detail analysis of the principle of the sphere decoding algorithm. In this paper, a novel variable radius sphere decoding is proposed. We introduce a golden section search algorithm to accelerate the convergence rate of the original algorithm. Thus it greatly reduces the complexity of the algorithm. Compared with the traditional sphere decoding algorithm, the proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the complexity of the receiving decode testing process. Thus this algorithm is more suitable to the real-time requirements of the TD-LTE system.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6013645","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6013532","startPage":"514","endPage":"517","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993482/6013532/06013645.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved sphere decoding algorithm in TD-LTE system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6013645/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6013645/","displayDocTitle":"Improved sphere decoding algorithm in TD-LTE system","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12260513","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved sphere decoding algorithm in TD-LTE system","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S0113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064407S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993482","isNumber":"6013532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993482","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6013532","articleId":"6013645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6013657,"authors":[{"name":"Liqiang Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Liqiang","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279829600"},{"name":"Wan Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37897619200"},{"name":"Wenjie Song","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Wenjie","lastName":"Song","id":"37894564800"},{"name":"Hailin Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Hailin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37293132300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-486-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-485-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-484-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6013657","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Delay","Femtocells","Cognitive radio","Analytical models","Jitter","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier sense multiple access","cognitive radio","femtocellular radio","mobile computing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","CR-CSMA/CA protocol","femto-WLAN","user differentiation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Femtocell","WLAN","Cognitive Radio","MAC","CSMA/CA"]}],"abstract":"To expand private femto-WLANs into public femto-WLANs, we present an integrated system of cognitive radio and femto-WLANs, cognitive femto-WLANs, which aims at meeting the requirements from the secondary users upon guaranteeing the requirements from the primary users.

The algorithm consists of two stages: feature extraction and classification. All acquired current signals are based on IEEE-754 single precision floating point format. In the feature extraction stage, floating point based features were obtained and then converted to the integer format. In the classification stage, all coding are written in VHDL using integer data type format. The proposed method classifies the stator related faults at higher level speed with better accuracy than conventional offline method. This is the first time that FPGA based fuzzy system has been employed to induction motor faults. With the proposed method, it is clearly identified the motor condition as either healthy or damaged, allowing one to perform a simple real time detection. A light computation load is required in order to perform the calculation of the algorithm. In addition, the implemented FPGA design allows the system reconfiguration to attain specific measurement conditions on different types of motors without hardware modifications.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993482/6013532/06013711.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"272","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6013711","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6013711","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6013532","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6013711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast fuzzy stator condition monitoring algorithm using FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Field programmable gate arrays","Fuzzy systems","Stators","Circuit faults","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","feature extraction","field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy logic","induction motors","stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast fuzzy stator condition monitoring algorithm","FPGA","realtime detection","stator faults","induction motors","feature extraction","feature classification","IEEE-754 single precision floating point format","integer data type format"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["filed-programmable gate array","VHDL","induction motors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6013711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"A fast fuzzy stator condition monitoring algorithm using FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6013711/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12260579","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast fuzzy stator condition monitoring algorithm using FPGA","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S0178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092258S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993482","isNumber":"6013532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993482","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6013532","articleId":"6013711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-16"},{"_id":6013720,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Wei-ping","affiliation":["Computer and Engineering Department, CDAVTC, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhu","lastName":"Wei-ping","id":"38274727700"},{"name":"Li Ming-xin","affiliation":["Computer and Engineering Department, CDAVTC, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Ming-xin","id":"38271394600"},{"name":"Chen Huan","affiliation":["YiBin Vocational and Technical College, YiBin, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Huan","id":"37391109700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-486-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-485-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-484-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6013720","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":3889},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Relational databases","Presses","Java","Computers","Telecommunications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information management","Internet","query processing","relational databases","SQL"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MongoDB","textbook management system","Internet Web2.0 technology","information management system","multitable join queries","nonrelational database management system","format loose data storage","query capability","NoSQL database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MongoDB","MySQL","RDBMS","NoSQL"]}],"abstract":"With the development of Internet Web2.0 technology, the traditional relational database is widely used in information management system.

This paper attempts to use NoSQL database to replace the relational database, applied to traditional information management systems, compare the two database technologies, give the key code of NoSQL implementation, and finally list the performance comparison of two schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6013720","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993482/6013532/06013720.pdf","startPage":"303","endPage":"305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6013720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6013532","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using MongoDB to implement textbook management system instead of MySQL","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6013720","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6013720/","displayDocTitle":"Using MongoDB to implement textbook management system instead of MySQL","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12260588","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6013720/","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using MongoDB to implement textbook management system instead of MySQL","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S0187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031128S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993482","isNumber":"6013532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993482","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6013532","articleId":"6013720","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6013722,"authors":[{"name":"Sudhakara Reddy Penubolu","affiliation":["ECE, Srikalahasteeswara Institute of Technology, J.N.T.

In order to have such ability, cognitive engine, the intelligent part of cognitive radio, should configure the system to adapt to its communication context. Although much artificial intelligence techniques have been proposed for the cognitive engine realization, this paper proposes an agent based realization method, which had been investigated in the autonomic communication research. Based on the similarity between cognitive radio and autonomic communication, the autonomic cognitive radio conceptual and architecture models are proposed. Cognitive radio nodes realized by the proposed models are easy to form an autonomic cognitive radio network, which can be looked as an autonomic communication environment. The autonomic cognitive radio node is expressed by autonomic communication element (ACE) architecture and a realization method is given based on the open-source ACE toolkit, which establishes a simulation environment for cognitive radio research.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6013743/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"12260611","publicationDate":"May 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6013743/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive radio simulation environment realization based on autonomic communication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive radio simulation environment realization based on autonomic communication","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S0210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052226S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993482","isNumber":"6013532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993482","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6013532","articleId":"6013743","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6013771,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Shu","affiliation":["Mechanical College, Shenyang University of Chemical Technology, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Shu","id":"37290703300"},{"name":"Meng Lei","affiliation":["Software Engineering, Shenyang Normal University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Meng","lastName":"Lei","id":"37587993400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-486-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-485-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-484-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6013771","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Algorithm design and analysis","Discrete wavelet transforms","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution","data compression","video coding","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform convolution algorithm","video file compression","video compression standard","dynamic sub-block redundancy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wavelet","video compress","convolution","multiresolution analysis","redundant sub-block"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a new algorithm in compression of video files is pointed out after in compression of video files.

DDS systems are characterized by fast switching, fine frequency discrimination, low phase noise, and transient-free frequency changes. Frequency changes are phase continuous, which is desirable in phase or frequency modulation. The fast frequency switching is useful in frequency-agile and spread spectrum systems. Algorithms used in communication technology require the computation of trigonometric functions, coordinate transformations, vector rotations, or hyperbolic rotations. The coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) is a rotation-based arithmetic computing algorithm which has found many important applications. CORDIC is not the fastest way to perform multiplications or to compute algorithms and exponentials, but, since the same algorithm enables the computation of most mathematical functions using basic operations of the form (a \u00b1 b) 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-i</sup>\n, it is attractive for hardware implementations.

It is a wireless communication technology, which has the capability of sensing and utilizing the underutilized spectrum resources. Recognizing idle spectrum efficiently is a key function for cognitive radio (CR) and requires high precision and fast signal processing technique. Sensitivity to noise uncertainty is limitation of current spectrum sensing strategies in CR networks. In this paper, a wavelet packet entropy based algorithm for detection of primary users in cognitive radio networks is proposed. In proposed algorithm, the presence of primary user can be examined by comparing the estimated wavelet packet entropy of signal to a threshold. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is robust against noise uncertainty; the normalized wavelet packet energy vector which carries important information on the frequency locations of subbands can estimate spectrum holes in the signal spectrum with simple structure and low computational complexity comparing to the conventional schemes. In addition, the proposed method does not need any prior knowledge of primary signal and noise energy level.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6014054/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12260388","htmlLink":"/document/6014054/","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet packet entropy based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet packet entropy based spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S0464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068786S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993482","isNumber":"6013532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993482","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6013532","articleId":"6014054","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6014068,"authors":[{"name":"Ronak Farhadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ronak","lastName":"Farhadi","id":"37888773600"},{"name":"Vahid Tabataba Vakili","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Vahid Tabataba","lastName":"Vakili","id":"37284997900"},{"name":"Shahriar Shirvani Moghadam","affiliation":["DCSP Research Laboratory, Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Shahid Rajaee Teacher Training University, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Shahriar Shirvani","lastName":"Moghadam","id":"37886376200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-486-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-485-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-484-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6014068","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","WiMAX"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","quality of service","scheduling","WiMax","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scheduling algorithms","OFDMA-based WiMAX networks","radio resources","MAX-SNR scheduling","proportional fairness scheduling","cross-layer scheduling algorithm","CACBQ algorithm","QoS","channel condition","packet loss rate","real-time services","MAX-SNR algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-Layer","IEEE802.16e","OFDMA","QoS","Scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Scheduling is an essential component in WiMAX networks for efficient use of radio resources.

To address face recognition problem, an approach based on 2D discrete fractional Fourier transform (2D-DFRFT) is proposed in this paper. First of all, the 2D-DFRFT of a facial image is computed. Then Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis (FLDA) are combined to perform discriminative feature extraction. Then the nearest neighbor (NN) classifier is applied to perform face recognition, based on Euclidean distance. Experimental results on ORL face database indicate that the proposed approach obtains good recognition effects.","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014352","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993482/6013532/06014352.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6013532","startPage":"656","endPage":"660","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition approach based on 2D discrete fractional Fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6014352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition approach based on 2D discrete fractional Fourier transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6014352/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12260123","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6014352/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition approach based on 2D discrete fractional Fourier transform","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S0725.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077679S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993482","isNumber":"6013532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993482","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6013532","articleId":"6014352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6014366,"authors":[{"name":"Shufang Li","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Environment Management College of China, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Shufang","lastName":"Li","id":"37898796700"},{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Environment Management College of China, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37899194800"},{"name":"Nannan Gai","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Environment Management College of China, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Nannan","lastName":"Gai","id":"37064473400"},{"name":"Jianqi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Environment Management College of China, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Jianqi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37897582300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-486-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-485-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-484-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6014366","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6014366","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software algorithms","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","probability","statistical testing","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal genetic algorithms","complex optimization problems","uncertain phenomena","probability simulation optimization method","simulation technology","statistical testing","probability method","uncertain phenomenon"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["orthogonal genetic algorithm","computer simulation","simulation optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014366","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993482/6013532/06014366.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","startPage":"707","endPage":"710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6013532","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research of orthogonal genetic algorithms in probability simulation","abstract":"In order to solve the complex optimization problems of uncertain phenomena effectively, this paper gives probability simulation optimization method based on orthogonal genetic algorithm.

Firstly, we construct independent classifier on each software metric. Then the classifying results in each feature are used to represent every module. We apply two different feature classifier algorithms (based on mean criterion and minimum error rate criterion, respectively) to obtain the classifying feature description of software modules. By using the proposed description technology, the discrimination of each metric is enlarged distinctly. Also, classifying feature description is simpler compared to numeric description, which would accelerate the speed of prediction model learning and reduce the storage space of massive data sets. Experiment results on four NASA data sets (CM1, KC1, KC2 and PC1) demonstrate the effectiveness of classifying feature description, and our algorithms can significantly improve the performance of software defect prediction.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2011.6014475","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6014458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2011.6014475","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009104/6014458/06014475.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classifying feature description for software defect prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Classifying feature description for software defect prediction","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6014475/","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12220723","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6014475/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classifying feature description for software defect prediction","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"1150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119769S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009104","isNumber":"6014458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009104","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6014458","articleId":"6014475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6014483,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Zhong Han","affiliation":["Aeronautics College, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Zhong","lastName":"Han","id":"37897747800"},{"name":"Zhen-Bao Liu","affiliation":["Aeronautics College, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhen-Bao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37065918500"},{"name":"Ya-Sen Xu","affiliation":["Aeronautics College, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Ya-Sen","lastName":"Xu","id":"37897050600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0282-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0283-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0281-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-5695"}],"articleNumber":"6014483","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis","Signal to noise ratio","Noise reduction","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","interpolation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive wavelet transform","interpolating method","predict type lifting scheme","optimal criteria","two-step lifting scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet transform","Lifting scheme","Adaptive signal processing","Signal denoising"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new adaptive wavelet transform using lifting scheme.

Combined with the deficiency analysis of particle filter, an adaptive resampling strategy based on diversity guidance is proposed. Firstly, the adaptive resampling step in particle filter is tuned based on two diversity measures which are effective sample size and population diversity factor. Moreover, the operation of particle mutation after resampling is integrated into PF so as to assure the diversity of particle sets. Then, an optimized resampling strategy in PF is presented. It drew from the advantage that resampling is done faster in partial stratified resampling algorithm. At the same time, aimed at the disadvantage of PSR algorithm in PF, it used the weights optimal idea to improve the performance of PF. With the simulation program using matlab 7.0 to track a single target motion from a fixed visual observation points, the validity of the proposed method is verified.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Particle measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Mathematical model","Particle filters","Equations","Weight measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle filtering (numerical methods)","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resampling strategy","particle filter","deficiency analysis","diversity guidance","population diversity factor","particle mutation","partial stratified resampling algorithm","PSR algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle filter","Adaptive resampling","Diversity measure","Particle mutation","Partial stratified resampling","Weight optimal idea"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2011.6014492","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009104/6014458/06014492.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6014458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2011.6014492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive resampling strategy in particle filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6014492","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive resampling strategy in particle filter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6014492/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6014492/","accessionNumber":"12220739","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive resampling strategy in particle filter","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"1178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05932S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009104","isNumber":"6014458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009104","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6014458","articleId":"6014492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6014499,"authors":[{"name":"Akira Morimoto","affiliation":["Information Science, Osaka Kyoiku University, Kashiwara, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Akira","lastName":"Morimoto","id":"37587895800"},{"name":"Ryuichi Ashino","affiliation":["Mathematical Sciences, Osaka Kyoiku University, Kashiwara, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryuichi","lastName":"Ashino","id":"37597160100"},{"name":"Shusuke Kataoka","affiliation":["Information Science, Osaka Kyoiku University, Kashiwara, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Shusuke","lastName":"Kataoka","id":"37903138700"},{"name":"Takeshi Mandai","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, Osaka Electro Communication University, Neyagawa, Osaka, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Mandai","id":"37597210000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0282-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0283-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0281-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"CD","value":"2158-5695"}],"articleNumber":"6014499","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEL","Signal to noise ratio","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","discrete wavelet transforms","image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monogenic signal","stationary wavelet transform","multidimensional generalization","continuous wavelet transform","redundant discrete wavelet transform","translation-invariant","blind image source separation","position-scale information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image separation","monogenic signal","stationary wavelet transform"]}],"abstract":"The monogenic signal is a multidimensional generalization of the analytic signal.

Being transformed into the wavelet domain, composite observations could be handled according to the distribution properties of the image wavelet domain representation, which means the wavelet coefficients components could be divided into one dense component and a number of sparse components, and different component can be measured with different noiselet observations. In the image reconstruction process, due to the measurement relation between the original image and the observations is established, we can use the total variation minimization method to reconstruct the original image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is competitive to the existed similar algorithms with higher quality of image reconstruction.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993482/6013532/06014595.pdf","startPage":"404","endPage":"407","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 3rd International Conference on Communication Software and Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014595","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCSN.2011.6014595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6013532","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6014595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The algorithm of image representation and reconstruction based on compressed sensing with composite measurement","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Image reconstruction","Boats","TV","Discrete wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","image representation","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","compressed sensing","composite measurement","wavelet transform","image wavelet domain representation","wavelet coefficient components","noiselet observation","total variation minimization method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","Composite Measurement","Noiselet","Total Variation Minimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6014595/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"The algorithm of image representation and reconstruction based on compressed sensing with composite measurement","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6014595/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12229930","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The algorithm of image representation and reconstruction based on compressed sensing with composite measurement","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S0845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050324S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993482","isNumber":"6013532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993482","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6013532","articleId":"6014595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6014634,"authors":[{"name":"Peilin Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Transport, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Peilin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37533586300"},{"name":"Yang Cui","affiliation":["Department of Transport, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Cui","id":"37893557600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-486-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-485-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-484-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6014634","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6014634","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on combination forecast of port container throughput based on Elman neural network","abstract":"As a nonlinear variation, the port container throughput is easy to get affected by market.

Quantum clone genetic algorithm has many shortcomings such as: low efficiency, poor population diversity, slow convergence speed, easy to trap in local minimums, blindness in global optimal searching direction and so on. An improved quantum clone genetic algorithm (IQCGA) is proposed in this paper. The algorithm have many merits: (1) Adopting the nicking probability division initialization strategy, population diversity is enhanced; (2) Introducing the quantum whole interference crossover, the information is spread in the whole population, so it helps to avoid trapping in local minimums, and accelerates convergence speed; (3) Making use of adaptation strategy in quantum rotate gate updating, searching speed for optimal solution is accelerated; (4) In order to avoid premature and evolution stagnation, the superior individual whole crossover quantum catastrophe strategy is adopted, which helps the population to search the objective solution in different directions. IQCGA is composted of initialization stage and iteration evolution stage. Furthermore, theory analysis is given to prove the convergence. Finally, Simulation results prove that the algorithms can maintain the population diversity, reduce calculation complexity, accelerate searching speed for optimal solution, and avoid trapping in local minimums. So it has the better searching optimal ability and convergence speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6014655/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12229988","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6014655/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improved quantum clone genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved quantum clone genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"S0904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063453S","chronDate":"27-29 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993482","isNumber":"6013532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993482","xplore-issue":"6013532","articleId":"6014655","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6014661,"authors":[{"name":"Li Xueqiao","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, ZhengZhou, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Xueqiao","id":"37887950300"},{"name":"Liang Shuang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, ZhengZhou, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Shuang","id":"37700272400"},{"name":"Chen Yuan","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Zhengzhou University of Light Industry, ZhengZhou, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37895148900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-486-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-485-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-484-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6014661","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The improvement of RTAI scheduler based on CPSS algorithm","abstract":"In real-time system, task scheduling policy is the key part of kernel design.

Then five features (such as the number of zero coefficients, the smallest and largest coefficients, the mean and standard deviation of coefficients) extract from each sub-band as feature vector. In this algorithm, S-PCA is used to select ten effective features from among WT features. Finally, we use KNN classifier and seven different signals of brain activities to evaluate the proposed method.

During the past few years, cloud computing has grown from being a promising business idea to one of the fastest growing parts of the IT industry. IT organizations have expresses concern about critical issues (such as security) that exist with the widespread implementation of cloud computing. These types of concerns originate from the fact that data is stored remotely from the customer's location; in fact, it can be stored at any location. Security, in particular, is one of the most argued-about issues in the cloud computing field; several enterprises look at cloud computing warily due to projected security risks. The risks of compromised security and privacy may be lower overall, however, with cloud computing than they would be if the data were to be stored on individual machines instead of in a so - called \"cloud\" (the network of computers used for remote storage and maintenance). Comparison of the benefits and risks of cloud computing with those of the status quo are necessary for a full evaluation of the viability of cloud computing. Consequently, some issues arise that clients need to consider as they contemplate moving to cloud computing for their businesses.

A new design flow is introduced to efficiently rapid prototype circuits with specific constraints on FPGA.

This means that these liquids may look like very similar in some experiments while in others they behave very differently. These differences must be understood and taken into account in the design of ester filled transformers to avoid unexpected failures. Classic models such as the two-parameter Weibull statistics of breakdown voltage are in some respects too simple to properly catch the underlying physics. We discuss the importance of segregating initiation and propagation processes to properly interpret results of experiments with esters and mineral oil. In transformer design it is in some parts more important to avoid initiation while in others it is more important to stop propagating streamers. Furthermore, to obtain low probability statistics from high probability breakdown experiments, both average and spread of breakdown voltages are required. The difference in spread of initiation and propagation voltages is discussed. Esters and mineral oils behave in a qualitatively similar way regarding initiation while they differ substantially in the propagation process. In this paper we compare some different experiments in terms of initiation and propagation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Dielectric Liquids","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005296/6015049/06015421.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE International Conference on Dielectric Liquids","doi":"10.1109/ICDL.2011.6015421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDL.2011.6015421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6015049","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6015421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differences in streamer initiation and propagation in ester fluids and mineral oil","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Minerals","Oil insulation","Power transformer insulation","Electrodes","Flashover","Fluids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformer oil","Weibull distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["streamer initiation","streamer propagation","ester fluid","mineral oil","ester filled transformer","two-parameter Weibull statistics","breakdown voltage","transformer design","low probability statistics","probability breakdown experiment","propagation voltage","initiation voltage","ester oil"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["transformer design","flashover","streamer initiation","propagation","ester fluid","mineral oil","Weibull distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-30 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Differences in streamer initiation and propagation in ester fluids and mineral oil","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6015421/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12221043","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"26-30 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differences in streamer initiation and propagation in ester fluids and mineral oil","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045024S","chronDate":"26-30 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005296","isNumber":"6015049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005296","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6015049","articleId":"6015421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6015499,"authors":[{"name":"Leland Gilreath","affiliation":["Advanced Technologies Department, Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems, Redondo Beach, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6031177/6015499/6015499-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Leland Gilreath (S'09) was born in California in 1982.

The proposed system is comprised of a direct-detection front-end architecture employing a balanced LNA with an embedded Dicke switch, power detector, and baseband circuitry. The use of a balanced LNA with an embedded Dicke switch minimizes front-end noise figure, resulting in a great imaging resolution. The receiver chip achieves a measured responsivity of 20-43 MV/W with a front-end 3-dB bandwidth of 26 GHz, while consuming 200 mW. The calculated NETD of the SiGe receiver chip is 0.4 K with a 30 ms integration time.

By moving a multistatic linear array perpendicularly to the array dimension, a 2-D aperture is sampled. The scope of application is concealed weapon detection in conjunction with the imaging of humans and, alternatively, nondestructive testing (NDT). The frequency range of 75-90 GHz was chosen because of the inherent high lateral resolution. For NDT, it seems to be a good compromise between lateral resolution and penetration depth as well. A moderate number of transmit and receive channels are achieved by a sparse periodic array (SPA) design. Since this is a far-field approach, ambiguities are not well suppressed in the near-field point spread function of the sparse array. An extension of the SPA concept for short-range applications on the basis of an optimized array design and an optimized beamforming algorithm is presented in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6029684/06015544.pdf","startPage":"3629","endPage":"3638","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2164616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2164616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029684","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6015544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Imaging With Optimized Sparse Periodic Array for Short-Range Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Apertures","Receiving antennas","Imaging","Image reconstruction","Kernel","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","military radar","millimetre wave imaging","MIMO radar","nondestructive testing","radar imaging","radar receivers","radar resolution","radar transmitters","synthetic aperture radar","weapons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave imaging","optimized sparse periodic array dimension","multiple input multiple output imaging system","synthetic aperture radar","digital beam forming","multistatic linear array","weapon detection","2D aperture","human imaging","nondestructive testing","inherent high lateral resolution","receiving channel","transmitting channel","near field point spread function","SPA concept","optimized beamforming algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Millimeter-wave (mmW) radar","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) systems","synthetic aperture radar (SAR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015544/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Imaging With Optimized Sparse Periodic Array for Short-Range Applications","volume":"49","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6015544/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12245281","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Imaging With Optimized Sparse Periodic Array for Short-Range Applications","sourcePdf":"tgrs-gumbmann-2164616-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062512S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6029684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"6029684","articleId":"6015544","onlineDate":"08 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6015547,"authors":[{"name":"Suayb S.

The proposed scheme efficiently trades off the available total bit budget between information bits and parity bits through efficient information block size adjustment, concatenated block coding, and random block interleavers. The objective is to create embedded codewords such that, for a particular information block, the necessary protection is obtained via multiple channel encodings, contrary to the conventional methods that use a single code rate per information block. This way, a more flexible protection scheme is obtained. The information block size and concatenated coding rates are judiciously chosen to maximize system performance, subject to a total bit budget. The set of codes is usually created by puncturing a low-rate mother code so that a single encoder-decoder pair is used. The proposed scheme is shown to effectively enlarge this code set by providing more protection levels than is possible using the code rate set directly. At the expense of complexity, average system performance is shown to be significantly better than that of several known comparison systems, particularly at higher channel bit error rates.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2167342","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/6151934/06015547.pdf","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2011.2167342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151934","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concatenated Block Codes for Unequal Error Protection of Embedded Bit Streams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Concatenated Block Codes for Unequal Error Protection of Embedded Bit Streams","volume":"21","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12537601","pubMedId":"21908257","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6015547/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015547/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concatenated Block Codes for Unequal Error Protection of Embedded Bit Streams","sourcePdf":"tip-arslan-2167342-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08392S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6151934","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6151934","articleId":"6015547","onlineDate":"08 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6015555,"authors":[{"name":"O. de la Barriere","affiliation":["SATIE, ENS Cachan, CNRS, UniverSud, Cachan, France"],"firstName":"O.","lastName":"de la Barriere","id":"38093296100"},{"name":"S.

This method requires much less computation time than conventional 3-D finite elements, and is therefore suitable for optimization purposes. In a first part, the mathematical procedure used to compute the machine no-load flux is described in detail. This method is 3-D, and then takes into account the radial edge effects of the machine, as well as the curvature effects by a resolution in cylindrical coordinates. Moreover, the originality of this method lies in the fact that it is totally analytical. The obtained results are verified using 3-D finite elements, and compared with simpler analytical models of axial flux machines, taken from the literature. This work puts in evidence the advantages of the proposed model. In particular, it is shown that the radial edge effects are important for a correct estimation of the no-load flux. On the contrary, the curvature effects are a second-order phenomenon.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2167347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6111552/06015555.pdf","startPage":"128","endPage":"136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2167347","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6015555","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015555/","displayDocTitle":"3-D Formal Resolution of Maxwell Equations for the Computation of the No-Load Flux in an Axial Flux Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine","volume":"48","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12427037","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6015555/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Formal Resolution of Maxwell Equations for the Computation of the No-Load Flux in an Axial Flux Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine","sourcePdf":"tmag-delabarriere-2167347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083445S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6111552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6111552","articleId":"6015555","onlineDate":"08 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":6015562,"authors":[{"name":"Shahab Mehraeen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/6062577/6015562/6015562-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahab Mehraeen (S'08\u2013M'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1995, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Esfahan University of Technology, Esfahan, Iran, in 2001.

The matching condition is not assumed when considering the interconnection terms. Then, NNs are utilized to approximate the uncertainties in both subsystem and interconnected terms. By using novel NN weight update laws with quadratic error terms as well as proposed control inputs, it is demonstrated using Lyapunov stability that the system states errors converge to zero asymptotically with both state and output feedback controllers, even in the presence of NN approximation errors in contrast with the uniform ultimate boundedness result, which is common in the literature with NN-based DSC and backstepping schemes.

In particular, two novel capacity bounds that allow for fast and efficient computation and apply for nonidentically distributed hops are derived. More importantly, they are generic since they apply to a wide range of popular fading channel models. Specifically, the proposed upper bound applies to Nakagami-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">m</i>\n, Weibull, and generalized-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</i>\n fading channels, whereas the proposed lower bound is more general and applies to Rician fading channels. Moreover, it is explicitly demonstrated that the proposed lower and upper bounds become asymptotically exact in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime.

We present an analysis of the influence of beamforming in indoor ultrawideband radio channels measured in the mm-wave 60 GHz band. The performance of narrowband and wideband direction-based beamformers is investigated in terms of improving channel metrics such as the delay spread, excess delay, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The performance of the direction-based beamformers is compared with dominant eigenmode transmission and statistical beamforming. Our analysis reveals that in line-of-sight (LOS) scenarios, the two direction-based beamformers have a similar performance that approaches the upper bound set by dominant eigenmode transmission. In non-LOS (NLOS) scenarios, the direction-based beamformers show a performance degradation in relation to the upper bound, with the narrowband beamformer worse off than the wideband variant. The array gain in our measured NLOS scenarios is observed to exceed the theoretical upper limit valid for a rich scattering environment. We show that this result follows from the spatial structure of the measured NLOS channels that has only a few strong reflected components. We investigate the influence of array size on beamforming performance; 5\u00d75 planar arrays are observed to improve the channel's delay metrics as well as the larger 7\u00d77 planar arrays.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.083111.100195","startPage":"3553","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6086674/06015598.pdf","endPage":"3559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.083111.100195","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015598/","displayDocTitle":"Beamforming Effects on Measured mm-Wave Channel Characteristics","volume":"10","issue":"11","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6015598/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12391190","publicationDate":"November 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beamforming Effects on Measured mm-Wave Channel Characteristics","sourcePdf":"3553-tw1111-wyne.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062749S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6015598","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6015601,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6086674/6015601/6015601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Wang (S'05-M'10) received his B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in Communication Engineering from Xidian University, China in 2001 and 2004, respectively; and Ph.

We assume an equal rate constraint for all users and adopt a realistic channel model that incorporates path loss, lognormal fading and Rayleigh fading. Several bounds are derived for the minimum transmission power of such rate-constrained MIMO cellular systems with various base station (BS) cooperation strategies. In particular, the upper power bound is based on the maximum eigenmode beamforming (MEB) scheme. These power bounds are then used to obtain the corresponding cellular capacity bounds when partial BS cooperation strategies are adopted. Our results show that, allowing more users to transmit simultaneously, introducing cooperation among BSs and increasing the number of antennas (especially at each BS) are efficient ways to improve system performance.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.083111.101154","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/6086674/06015601.pdf","startPage":"3720","endPage":"3731","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.083111.101154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6086674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Capacity of MIMO Cellular Systems with Base Station Cooperation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6015601","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"November  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015601/","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity of MIMO Cellular Systems with Base Station Cooperation","volume":"10","issue":"11","publicationDate":"November 2011","accessionNumber":"12391193","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6015601/","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity of MIMO Cellular Systems with Base Station Cooperation","sourcePdf":"3720-tw1111-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14044S","chronDate":"November  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6086674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6086674","articleId":"6015601","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6015602,"authors":[{"name":"Michel Nahas","affiliation":["Orange Laboratories, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6064710/6015602/6015602-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Michel Nahas was born in Kosba, Lebanon, in 1984.

The general design method is based on the concatenation and permutation of optimal synchronous space time block codes and works for an arbitrary number of transmitting and receiving antennas. Examples of bounded delay tolerant codes based on the Alamouti code, the Golden code and Threaded Algebraic Space-Time (TAST) codes are given. Theoretical proofs are used to show that the new codes respect the design criteria.

In this study, the VLF signal is from the transmitter station at Ebino, Japan. Direct interference from lightning discharge is one of the disturbances where the broad spectrum of electromagnetic radiation generated will be trapped in the wave guide formed by the ground and the lower ionosphere. This will trigger the change in the amplitude of the VLF wave propagation that spreads in the sub-ionosphere. This problem illustrates the need to predict the disturbance to the propagation of VLF signals caused by lightning discharge that could result in communication disorders. In this work, a prediction method using ANN with multilayer back propagation is proposed. Other techniques used by the previous researches include theoretical models, statistical models, empirical model and wave hop field strength method. All these techniques require complex mathematical function and are less significant. The proposed method showed better performance in comparison to the conventional approaches in that for the forecasting results of the observations obtained using statistics, the mean percentage error is only 1.822 while for the results of the prediction using the neural network the mean percentage error is 0.1381.","doi":"10.1109/IConSpace.2011.6015852","startPage":"61","endPage":"64","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 2011 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IConSpace.2011.6015852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6015839","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 2011 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005299/6015839/06015852.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of VLF propagation signal JJI Japan disturbed by lightning using artificial neural networks: Preliminary results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015852/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of VLF propagation signal JJI Japan disturbed by lightning using artificial neural networks: Preliminary results","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6015852/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12228788","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"12-13 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of VLF propagation signal JJI Japan disturbed by lightning using artificial neural networks: Preliminary results","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"IS1113102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05478S","chronDate":"12-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005299","isNumber":"6015839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005299","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6015839","articleId":"6015852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":6015860,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The advantages of FSO over fiber are time and cost of deployment. However, since the transmission medium of FSO is atmosphere, atmospheric scattering is the major cause for interruption of FSO link. In temperate region, fog is the main factor that affects the availability of the link. However, in tropical region non-selective scattering is expected to be the major drawback. Non-selective scattering is wavelength independent and exists due to rainfall. In country like Malaysia rain season with heavy rain can reduce the received power of FSO link to below the threshold. In this paper the preliminary analysis is presented for the use in the larger scale to construct the tropical rain attenuation model for FSO. The result from the analysis showing that heavy rain will cause the attenuation of the link however the 99.999% is still achievable for the FSO system under Malaysia weather condition.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 2011 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005299/6015839/06015860.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"101","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 2011 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","doi":"10.1109/IConSpace.2011.6015860","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IConSpace.2011.6015860","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6015839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6015860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preliminary analysis on the effect of rain attenuation on Free Space Optics (FSO) propagation measured in tropical weather condition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rain","Attenuation","Scattering","Availability","Optics","Optical fiber cables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric light propagation","atmospheric techniques","optical communication","optical links","rain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free space optics propagation","high speed connectivity","fiber optics","transmission medium","atmospheric scattering","FSO link interruption","temperate region","fog","nonselective scattering","Malaysia","tropical rain attenuation model","tropical weather condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free Space Optic (FSO)","atmospheric attenuation","scattering attenuation","rain attenuation","tropical region"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015860/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Preliminary analysis on the effect of rain attenuation on Free Space Optics (FSO) propagation measured in tropical weather condition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6015860/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12259878","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"12-13 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Preliminary analysis on the effect of rain attenuation on Free Space Optics (FSO) propagation measured in tropical weather condition","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"IS112143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045677S","chronDate":"12-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005299","isNumber":"6015839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005299","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6015839","articleId":"6015860","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6015903,"authors":[{"name":"Nur Haedzerin Md.

With current interest in this technology as an alternative backup to the already established broadband technology, a proper understanding on the performance of FSO link has become vital and thus arise the need to examine the effect of these multiple transceivers on FSO link. This paper gives the preliminary result of the FSO link performance in terms of geometrical losses, power received and link margin using precise mathematical relations regardless of the various atmospheric conditions. Thus, this is the first step towards developing a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple transmitters/receivers on FSO link to be used as a benchmark in the practical implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 2011 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6005299/6015839/06015903.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"295","publicationTitle":"Proceeding of the 2011 IEEE International Conference on Space Science and Communication (IconSpace)","doi":"10.1109/IConSpace.2011.6015903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IConSpace.2011.6015903","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6015839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6015903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical analysis of multiple transmitters/receivers on the performance of Free Space Optics (FSO) link","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical transmitters","Laser beams","Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers","Optical losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["losses","optical links","optical transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["free space optics link","atmospheric phenomena","FSO system","broadband technology","geometrical loss","multiple optical transceiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free Space Optics (FSO)","line of sight (LOS)","geometrical losses","link margin","multiple TX/RX FSO"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-13 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical analysis of multiple transmitters/receivers on the performance of Free Space Optics (FSO) link","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6015903/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12228795","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","conferenceDate":"12-13 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical analysis of multiple transmitters/receivers on the performance of Free Space Optics (FSO) link","confLoc":"Penang, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"IS1164117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051497S","chronDate":"12-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6005299","isNumber":"6015839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6005299","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6015839","articleId":"6015903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6015904,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The asynchronous part includes the neighborhood mechanism that ensures the asynchronous spreading of the adaptation enabling signal amongst the neurons neighboring the winning unit. This mechanism is fully programmable and enables runtime adaptation of the neighborhood radius. The overall SOM consists of a controller, the winning neuron selecting unit and the number of neurons that results from the size of the map. The proposed implementation is fully scalable and mostly independent on the size of the map in terms of achievable maximum data rate with only one exception, i.e. the maximum delay introduced by the asynchronous neighborhood mechanism.

When operating at 2GHz input frequency, clocks from 83MHz to 666MHz can be generated with a typical power consumption between 0.6mW and 1.6mW.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6015915","startPage":"264","endPage":"269","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - MIXDES 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6006988/6015915/06015921.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An open-loop clock generator for fast frequency scaling in 65nm CMOS technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6015921/","displayDocTitle":"An open-loop clock generator for fast frequency scaling in 65nm CMOS technology","conferenceDate":"16-18 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12219603","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An open-loop clock generator for fast frequency scaling in 65nm CMOS technology","confLoc":"Gliwice, Poland","sourcePdf":"114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076462S","chronDate":"16-18 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006988","isNumber":"6015915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006988","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6015915","articleId":"6015921","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Tech Univ of Lodz","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6015925,"authors":[{"name":"Andrzej Pu\u0142ka","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Department of Automatic Control, Electronics and Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Pu\u0142ka","id":"37871737000"},{"name":"Adam Milik","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics, Department of Automatic Control, Electronics and Computer Science, Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Milik","id":"37396163600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-932075-2-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0304-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-83-932075-1-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6015925","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Hardware","Table lookup","Registers","Algorithm design and analysis","Field programmable gate arrays","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","systolic arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware implementation","Smith-Waterman algorithm","genome alignment search","dynamic programming","systolic array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DNA-tiles","Pattern routing","Pipelining","FPGA synthesis","Parallelism and concurrency","Reconfigurable systems","Dynamic programming","Systolic arrays"]}],"abstract":"The paper presents optimized hardware structure applied to genome alignment search. The proposed methodology is based on dynamic programming. The authors show how starting from the original Smith-Waterman approach, the algorithm can be optimized and the evaluation process simplified and speeded-up. The main idea is based on the observations of growth trends in the adjacent cells of the systolic array, which leads to the incremental approach. Moreover various coding styles are discussed and the best technique allowing further reduction of resources is selected. The entire processing unit utilizes fully pipelined structure that is well balanced trade-off between performance and resource requirements. The proposed technique is implemented in modern FPGA structures and obtained results proved efficiency of the methodology comparing to other approaches in the field.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Considerations on incremental approach to hardware implementation of Smith-Waterman algorithm","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - MIXDES 2011","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems - MIXDES 2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6006988/6015915/06015925.pdf","startPage":"283","endPage":"288","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6015915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6015925","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6015925/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Considerations on incremental approach to hardware implementation of Smith-Waterman algorithm","conferenceDate":"16-18 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6015925/","dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12219607","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Considerations on incremental approach to hardware implementation of Smith-Waterman algorithm","confLoc":"Gliwice, Poland","sourcePdf":"118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045728S","chronDate":"16-18 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006988","isNumber":"6015915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006988","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6015915","articleId":"6015925","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Tech Univ of Lodz","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6015927,"authors":[{"name":"Tomasz Tala\u015bka","affiliation":["University of Technology and Life Sciences, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Tala\u015bka","id":"37294952800"},{"name":"Pawel Przedwojski","affiliation":["Tieto Poland Sp. z o.o., Szczecin, Poland"],"firstName":"Pawel","lastName":"Przedwojski","id":"38559938900"},{"name":"Rafal D\u0142ugosz","affiliation":["University of Technology and Life Sciences, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"firstName":"Rafal","lastName":"D\u0142ugosz","id":"37547281300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-932075-2-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0304-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-83-932075-1-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6015927","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Artificial neural networks","Hardware","Microcontrollers","Biological neural networks","Application specific integrated circuits","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","application specific integrated circuits","digital-analogue conversion","flexible electronics","neural nets","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible winner takes all neural network","conscience mechanism","microcontrollers","AVR cores","ARM cores","analog to digital converters","digital to analog converters","hardware model","VLSI","ASIC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["hardware implemented neural networks","WTA learning algorithm","microcontrollers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6015927","abstract":"A flexible, fully programmable Winner Takes All (WTA) Neural Network (NN) has been realized on two microcontrollers (\u03bcC) with the AVR and the ARM cores placed on a single board.

In this paper we focus on the influence of the, so called, conscience mechanism on the learning quality of the NN.

The proposed system consists of a dedicated data fusion engine for each component of the control system. Each data fusion engine implements three-layered alarm system consisting of: 1) conventional threshold-based alarms, 2) anomalous behavior detector using self-organizing maps, and 3) prediction error based alarms using neural network based signal forecasting. The proposed system was integrated with a model of the Idaho National Laboratory Hytest facility, which is a testing facility for hybrid energy systems.

At the same time, mistakes in feedback are sometimes unavoidable. Therefore, an adaptively trained model with old data is sub-optimal unless the new revisions are taken into account. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a faulty feedback on the performance of an e-commerce customer identification neural network model. We first investigate the impact of feedback error on an adaptive model's performance. We then examine a technique to undo the incorrect adjustments to the model by re-training the adaptive model by a corrected feedback. Our results showthe majority of lossinmodel performance due to the feedback error is recoveredby re-training the adaptive model with the new corrected data.","doi":"10.1109/ISRCS.2011.6016086","pdfPath":"/iel5/6006987/6016075/06016086.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"45","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 4th International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems","publicationTitle":"2011 4th International Symposium on Resilient Control Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISRCS.2011.6016086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016075","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correction of erroneously-trained adaptive neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Correction of erroneously-trained adaptive neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12221852","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6016086/","conferenceDate":"9-11 Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correction of erroneously-trained adaptive neural networks","confLoc":"Boise, ID, USA","sourcePdf":"0042bf000248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066931S","chronDate":"9-11 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006987","isNumber":"6016075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006987","xplore-issue":"6016075","articleId":"6016086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6016195,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-6665-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6016195","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":42,"totalDownloads":8532},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"LAN/MAN Standards Committee of the IEEE Computer Society"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016195","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE standards","Local area networks","Metropolitan area networks","Optical fiber communication","Wireless communication","Laser diodes","IEEE 802.15 Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","local area networks","metropolitan area networks","multimedia communication","optical communication","radio spectrum management","telecommunication standards","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standard","metropolitan area network","local area network","short-range wireless optical communication","visible light","PHY layer","MAC layer","optically transparent media","visible light spectrum","audio service","video multimedia service","visible link","visible-light infrastructure","source like ambient light","eye safety regulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["IEEE 802.15.7","laser diode","LD","LED","light-emitting diode","short-range optical wireless communications","visible light","visible-light communication","VLC"]}],"abstract":"A PHY and a MAC layer for short-range optical wireless communications using visible light in optically transparent media are defined.

Unfortunately, careful investigation of the unique challenges presented by new domains exposes its idiosyncrasies, thus often requiring new approaches and solutions. In this paper, we argue that the \u201csmart\u201d grid, replacing its incredibly successful and reliable predecessor, poses a series of new security challenges, among others, that require novel approaches to the field of cyber security. We will call this new field cyber-physical security. The tight coupling between information and communication technologies and physical systems introduces new security concerns, requiring a rethinking of the commonly used objectives and methods. Existing security approaches are either inapplicable, not viable, insufficiently scalable, incompatible, or simply inadequate to address the challenges posed by highly complex environments such as the smart grid.

Considering a two-time-slot relaying scheme, we design the optimal beamforming coefficients to maximize the sum-rate of AF-based TWRN under total relay power constraint (TRPC). Although the optimization problem is neither convex nor concave, we show that the global optimal solution can be obtained by the branch-and-bound algorithm. To address the computational complexity concern, we also propose a low-complexity suboptimal solution which is obtained by optimizing a cost function over one real variable only. Simulation results show that the proposed optimal solution outperforms existing schemes significantly.

However, designing good ASR systems with little or no language-specific speech data for resource-limited languages is still a challenging research topic. As a consequence, there has been an increasing interest in exploring knowledge sharing among a large number of languages so that a universal set of acoustic phone units can be defined to work for multiple or even for all languages. This work aims at demonstrating that a recently proposed automatic speech attribute transcription framework can play a key role in designing language-universal acoustic models by sharing speech units among all target languages at the acoustic phonetic attribute level. The language-universal acoustic models are evaluated through phone recognition. It will be shown that good cross-language attribute detection and continuous phone recognition performance can be accomplished for \u201cunseen\u201d languages using minimal training data from the target languages to be recognized. Furthermore, a phone-based background model (PBM) approach will be presented to improve attribute detection accuracies.","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2011.2167610","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/6125258/06016213.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2011.2167610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6125258","startPage":"875","endPage":"887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiments on Cross-Language Attribute Detection and Phone Recognition With Minimal Target-Specific Training Data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Experiments on Cross-Language Attribute Detection and Phone Recognition With Minimal Target-Specific Training Data","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016213/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12470260","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6016213/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments on Cross-Language Attribute Detection and Phone Recognition With Minimal Target-Specific Training Data","sourcePdf":"tasl-siniscalchi-2167610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118548S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"6125258","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6125258","articleId":"6016213","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6016217,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Huei Lee","affiliation":["Institute of Electrical Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6056707/6016217/6016217-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu-Huei Lee (S'09) was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

Four selected crossovers have been realized as a tandem connection of two 3-dB/90\u00b0 coupled-line directional couplers, which, together with reference lines having appropriate electrical lengths, perform simultaneously crossovers of signal lines, and all needed broadband constant value phase shifters. Moreover, two of the needed 3-dB/90\u00b0 directional couplers have been designed as tandem connections of two 8.34-dB directional couplers, acting as 3-dB/90\u00b0 directional couplers having crossed outputs. With such a modification, a fully planar design with no inter-layer connections is possible. The proposed network arrangement has been experimentally tested with the design of an 8 \u00d7 8 Butler matrix operating at the center frequency of 3 GHz.

In this work, we enhance our previous approach in order to include the effects of permanent and transient faults that may be present in the lower levels of hardware implementation. We then formally analyze the vulnerability of performance of RTL designs to faults that are present at different locations. If a performance requirement is not met, we employ probabilistic model checking with a diagnostic property that can be used to identify the broad cause of performance degradation. In this work, we describe our entire approach by considering RTL designs corresponding to multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. We illustrate our enhanced approach on the Viterbi decoder which is a nontrivial component of MIMO system designs.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2164103","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6246737/06016225.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2164103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6246737","startPage":"1914","endPage":"1918","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Formal Performance Analysis for Faulty MIMO Hardware","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Formal Performance Analysis for Faulty MIMO Hardware","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016225/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12879443","dateOfInsertion":"20 July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6016225/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Formal Performance Analysis for Faulty MIMO Hardware","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-asokkumar-2164103-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095289S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6246737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","xplore-issue":"6246737","articleId":"6016225","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6016227,"authors":[{"name":"Kangwoo Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kangwoo","lastName":"Park","id":"37539842700"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6016227","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1101},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete Fourier transforms","Peak to average power ratio","Time domain analysis","OFDM","Complexity theory","Power demand"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","computational complexity","fast Fourier transforms","iterative methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity tone reservation","PAPR reduction","peak-to-average-power ratio","OFDM communication systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing communication systems","symbol error rate","SER","iterative computations","fast Fourier transform","inverse FFT","computational complexity","approximate algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR)","projection onto convex set (POCS)-based clipping","tone reservation"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing communication systems have a drawback that some signal values can be much higher than the average signal value. Transmitting such a high signal increases symbol error rate (SER) significantly, as the signal is usually distorted by the nonlinearity of power amplifiers. Most of previous methods presented to reduce the peak-to-average-power ratio are based on iterative computations of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT associated with large computational complexity. To lower the computational complexity of the tone reservation method, this paper proposes approximate algorithms and their implementation structures. Simulation results show that the SER performance of the proposed structure is similar to that of the conventional one. Compared to the conventional structure, the proposed structure reduces hardware complexity and power consumption by 62.2% and 58.4%, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2164104","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6246737/06016227.pdf","startPage":"1919","endPage":"1923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2164104","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6246737","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Complexity Tone Reservation for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016227","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016227/","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Tone Reservation for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Communication Systems","volume":"20","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2012","accessionNumber":"12879445","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6016227/","dateOfInsertion":"20 July 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Tone Reservation for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-park-2164104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067242S","chronDate":"Oct.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6246737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6246737","articleId":"6016227","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6016234,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Hui Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Ming Chuan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6126191/6016234/6016234-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kai-Hui Lee received the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from the National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2002.","He joined the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Ming Chuan University, Taipei, Taiwan, as an associate professor in 2003.

It suffers a management problem, because of which dealers cannot visually identify each share. This problem is solved by the extended visual cryptography scheme (EVCS), which adds a meaningful cover image in each share. However, the previous approaches involving the EVCS for general access structures suffer from a pixel expansion problem. In addition, the visual cryptography (VC)-based approach needs a sophisticated codebook design for various schemes. In this paper, we propose a general approach to solve the above- mentioned problems; the approach can be used for binary secret images in noncomputer-aided decryption environments. The pro- posed approach consists of two phases. In the first phase, based on a given access structure, we construct meaningless shares using an optimization technique and the construction for conventional VC schemes. In the second phase, cover images are added in each share directly by a stamping algorithm. The experimental results indicate that a solution to the pixel expansion problem of the EVCS for GASs is achieved. Moreover, the display quality of the recovered image is very close to that obtained using conventional VC schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016234/","volume":"7","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6016234/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12471628","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Extended Visual Cryptography Algorithm for General Access Structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Extended Visual Cryptography Algorithm for General Access Structures","sourcePdf":"tifs-chiu-2167611-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084296S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6126191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6126191","articleId":"6016234","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6016236,"authors":[{"name":"Duc-Son Pham","affiliation":["Institute for Multisensor and Content Analysis, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Duc-Son","lastName":"Pham","id":"38183838200"},{"name":"Svetha Venkatesh","affiliation":["Institute for Multisensor and Content Analysis, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Svetha","lastName":"Venkatesh","id":"37279180300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"6016236","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1676},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Noise","Convergence","Cost function","Minimization","Upper bound","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","image coding","image sampling","impulse noise","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image recovery","data compression","impulsive noise","compressed sensing","information sampling theory","imaging application","magnetic resonance imaging","astronomy","outlier suppression","iterative algorithm","nonGaussian noise","image compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing (CS)","image compression","impulsive noise","inverse problems","robust recovery","robust statistics"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Data Compression","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016236","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2011.2162418","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","abstract":"Compressed sensing (CS) is a new information sampling theory for acquiring sparse or compressible data with much fewer measurements than those otherwise required by the Nyquist/Shannon counterpart.

Specifically, for the fixed case, a necessary and sufficient condition on the interaction topology is established for the agents to reach (average) consensus under certain assumptions. For the dynamically changing case, some sufficient conditions are obtained for the agents to reach consensus, where the condition imposed on the dynamical topologies is shown to be more relaxed than that required in the existing literature.

This problem has been addressed before mainly from frame-theoretic point of view and only for the case of what we call in this paper classic erasure. In the frame-theoretic approach, the stable filter banks are associated with frames in \u2113\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n(\\BBZ) and a subband erasure is defined as the deletion of the frame expansion coefficients corresponding to the frame vectors resulting from each filter and all its translated versions. This is equivalent to assuming that all the samples of a subband have been completely lost (classic erasure) and this is why in this approach it is always assumed that each channel is either working perfectly or not at all. In this paper, we extend this notion of erasure to a situation where subband channels are allowed to be on or off arbitrarily in each time instance and we define a new type of erasure called instantaneous erasure. Using an approach based on the time-domain analysis of perfect reconstruction property, we introduce general conditions for perfect reconstruction of the output and also the sufficient conditions for two classes of filter banks: Causal OFBs with causal inverse and OFBs with maximum robustness against classic erasure.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2167617","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06016246.pdf","startPage":"5800","endPage":"5813","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2167617","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Instantaneous Erasures in Oversampled Filter Banks: Conditions for Output Perfect Reconstruction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Instantaneous Erasures in Oversampled Filter Banks: Conditions for Output Perfect Reconstruction","volume":"59","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6016246/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358042","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016246/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Instantaneous Erasures in Oversampled Filter Banks: Conditions for Output Perfect Reconstruction","sourcePdf":"tsp-akbari-2167617-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097864S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"6016246","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6016249,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Hellings","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Hellings","id":"37547950700"},{"name":"Wolfgang Utschick","affiliation":["Associate Institute for Signal Processing, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Utschick","id":"37273316200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6016249","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":381},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transceivers","Covariance matrix","Encoding","MIMO","Receivers","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","channel coding","decoding","linear codes","MIMO communication","precoding","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel MIMO broadcast channels","linear transceivers","parallel multiple-input multiple-output channel","information theory","subchannel decoding","subchannel encoding","power allocation","linear precoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear transceivers","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","multi-user multi-carrier systems","parallel broadcast channels","rate region","separable and inseparable channels"]}],"abstract":"Parallel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channels have been shown to be separable from an information theoretic point of view, i.e., capacity can be achieved with a strategy that performs separate encoding and decoding on each subchannel subject to a power allocation across subchannels.

In the MGM scenario, each source may broadcast its message to a group of multiple users rather than to a single user only. Common distributed beamformer designs for MUP2P relay networks aim to minimize the total transmitted relay power subject to receiver quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. In state-of-the-art techniques, the resulting nonconvex problem is approximated by a convex one which is efficiently solvable using interior point methods. These techniques are shown to be straightforwardly extendable to more general MGM relay networks. However, as the number of receivers increases (which may be typical for the proposed MGM networks where each multicast group may contain many users), these approximations become more and more inaccurate leading to severe performance degradation and problem infeasibility. To avoid this drawback, we propose an iterative method where in each iteration, a convex approximation of the original problem is solved and then adapted to the solution obtained in this iteration. We show that the approximate solution can be successively improved using such iterations. Simulation results show that in scenarios with large numbers of destination users, the proposed method substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art methods developed for MUP2P relay networks.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2167618","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6104236/06016250.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2167618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6104236","startPage":"221","endPage":"232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Beamforming for Multi-Group Multicasting Relay Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016250","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Beamforming for Multi-Group Multicasting Relay Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12425217","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6016250/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Beamforming for Multi-Group Multicasting Relay Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-pesavento-2167618-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069346S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6104236","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6104236","articleId":"6016250","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6016251,"authors":[{"name":"Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Universidade de Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6069620/6016251/6016251-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gonzalo Vazquez-Vilar (M'08) received the Telecommunications Engineering degree from the Universidad de Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2004, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the Universidad de Vigo, Vigo, Spain, in 2011.","During 2006, he was a Project Engineer with Siemens A.G., Saarbruecken, Germany.

CSS usually improves sensing performance at the price of delay and energy consumption. A selfish sensor only decides to conduct CSS if it is more profitable than performing LSS. A key issue is how to achieve a desired decision outcome that maximizes spectrum utilization under the requirement of self-interest maximization and primary user (PU) protection. To address this problem, we formulate the interactive deciding of sensors as a noncooperative game, and Nash equilibrium (NE) corresponds to a stable decision outcome that no sensor has an incentive to resist unilaterally. It is shown that the desired decision outcome can be obtained by solving a constrained nonlinear 0-1 programming problem. We derive the desired decision outcome for homogenous sensors, and then develop a sensor selection mechanism for heterogeneous sensors to achieve the desired decision outcome in a distributed fashion. The proposed mechanism is shown to have a relatively low complexity. Computer simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2167614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6069620","startPage":"6033","endPage":"6044","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6069620/06016252.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Distributed Sensor Selection Mechanism for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016252/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6016252/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Distributed Sensor Selection Mechanism for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12358047","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"12","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Distributed Sensor Selection Mechanism for Cooperative Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"tsp-yuan-2167614-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101476S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6069620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6069620","articleId":"6016252","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6016378,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Guo","affiliation":["School oflnformation Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Qiang Guo","id":"37591776900"},{"name":"Dawei Sun","affiliation":["School oflnformation Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Dawei Sun","id":"37535697000"},{"name":"Guiran Chang","affiliation":["Computing Center, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Guiran Chang","id":"37534976300"},{"name":"Lina Sun","affiliation":["School oflnformation Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Lina","lastName":"Sun","id":"37532692600"},{"name":"Xingwei Wang","affiliation":["School oflnformation Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Xingwei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293609500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8810-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8809-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6016378","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1234},"abstract":"Today, one of the most important factors for the success of cloud computing is to create trust and security. Cloud computing will face a lot of challenges when the key element trust is absent. There are no special trust evaluation models for cloud computing environment. In this paper, the definition of trust in cloud systems is introduced and the properties of trust are analyzed. Based on the properties and semantics of trust, an extensible trust evaluation model named ETEC is proposed, which includes a time-variant comprehensive evaluation method for expressing direct trust and a space-variant evaluation method for calculating recommendation trust. To compute trust in cloud systems, an algorithm based on the ETEC model is given. Simulation and analysis shows that this model can calculate the trust degree effectively and reasonably in cloud computing environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/5993576/6016352/06016378.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"116","publicationTitle":"2011 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Control","doi":"10.1109/ICACC.2011.6016378","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACC.2011.6016378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016352","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and evaluation of trust in cloud computing environments","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Program processors","Analytical models","Cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trust evaluation model","cloud computing environments","ETEC","time-variant comprehensive evaluation method","recommendation trust. calculation","space-variant evaluation method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["trust model","extensible","security","trust evaluation","cloud computing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016378/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Jan. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and evaluation of trust in cloud computing environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6016378/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"12229116","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","conferenceDate":"18-20 Jan. 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and evaluation of trust in cloud computing environments","confLoc":"Harbin, China","sourcePdf":"027E175.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.165905S","chronDate":"18-20 Jan. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5993576","isNumber":"6016352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5993576","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6016352","articleId":"6016378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6016432,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Chen","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yun Chen","id":"37539686000"},{"name":"Yilin Wang","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yilin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540209900"},{"name":"Jidan Mei","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Jidan Mei","id":"37605128200"},{"name":"Ping Cai","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Underwater Acoustic Technology, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Cai","id":"37531275300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8810-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8809-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6016432","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"abstract":"In order to improve communication rate and frequency band efficiency of the underwater acoustic (UWA) communication system, a new method using positive and negative slope LFM signal joint coding based on fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) was presented in this paper.

In this paper, we present a GPU-based volume visualization approach for real-time interactive human heart illustration. In our scheme, we first design the transfer function by constructing a lookup table, and adopt a slice-based direct volume rendering method for real-time visualization. Then, a real time heart tissue isolation strategy is used to illustrate each tissue individually.

Thus, the proposed method is more suitable for the real-time video streaming service.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-complexity bit allocation of layered FEC using LDPC for H.264 scalable video","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016618","publicationTitle":"The 7th International Conference on Digital Content, Multimedia Technology and its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 7th International Conference on Digital Content, Multimedia Technology and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008798/6016618/06016649.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016649","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","displayDocTitle":"Low-complexity bit allocation of layered FEC using LDPC for H.264 scalable video","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6016649/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12230126","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-complexity bit allocation of layered FEC using LDPC for H.264 scalable video","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"29IDCTAPAPER.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048134S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008798","isNumber":"6016618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008798","xplore-issue":"6016618","articleId":"6016649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6016659,"authors":[{"name":"Jisun Yoon","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jisun","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37406955900"},{"name":"Sangtae Lee","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sangtae","lastName":"Lee","id":"37539823100"},{"name":"Jitae Shin","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jitae","lastName":"Shin","id":"37400263300"},{"name":"Seok Ho Won","affiliation":["Creative & Challenging Research Division, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seok Ho","lastName":"Won","id":"37614181200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-89-88678-47-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0473-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6016659","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Network coding","Error probability","Multiplexing","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cooperative communication","error statistics","MIMO communication","network coding","radio networks","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless relay-based MIMO system","network coding","multiple antenna scheme","multiple-input multiple-output system","multiple node","relay node","error probability","channel capacity","multiuser uplink relay-based cooperative communication","source-to-relay transmission","relay-to-destination transmission","optimal switching point","SNR","signal-to-noise ratio"]}],"abstract":"Recently, relay-based cooperative system has drawn much attention. There are several technical components to be considered in this relay system such as multiple antenna schemes, network coding, etc. In this paper, we do a performance analysis using a combination of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques and network coding in a wireless relay-based cooperative system having multiple nodes to send data toward one destination via one relay node which performs network coding. For the performance analysis, we derive overall error probability and channel capacity for multi-user uplink relay-based cooperative communication. The results show that the changes among MIMO modes (i.e., spatial multiplexing or diversity mode) at the transmission between source-to-relay or relay-to-destination is useful to maximize system capacity. Also this analysis can decide an optimal switching point of SNR for different MIMO modes in terms of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in order to achieve best performance. Thus, a practical guidance of combined scheme using network coding and MIMO can be derived.","publicationTitle":"The 7th International Conference on Digital Content, Multimedia Technology and its Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"The 7th International Conference on Digital Content, Multimedia Technology and its Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008798/6016618/06016659.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016618","startPage":"188","endPage":"191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of wireless relay-based MIMO system using network coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016659","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of wireless relay-based MIMO system using network coding","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016659/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12230136","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6016659/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of wireless relay-based MIMO system using network coding","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"39IDCTAPAPER.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051418S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008798","isNumber":"6016618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008798","xplore-issue":"6016618","articleId":"6016659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6016682,"authors":[{"name":"Rung-Ching Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan R.O.C"],"firstName":"Rung-Ching","lastName":"Chen","id":"37693219400"},{"name":"Jiun Yao Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Information Management Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan R.O.C"],"firstName":"Jiun Yao","lastName":"Chiu","id":"37996094100"},{"name":"Cho Tsan Batj","affiliation":["Department of Medicine, Taichung Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan R.O.C.","Department of Information Management Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan R.O.C"],"firstName":"Cho Tsan","lastName":"Batj","id":"37086906678"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0308-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0305-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0307-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6016682","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":430},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sugar","Medical services","Sorting","Hardware design languages","Ontologies","Nickel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","decision support systems","drugs","medical computing","medical information systems","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","recommender systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medicine recommendation","multiple criteria decision making","domain ontology","anti-diabetic medicines","recommendation system","requirement analysis","Department of Health","Taiwan","decision support system","drug selection","MCDM","medicine knowledge ontology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ontology","Multiple Criteria Decision Making","Entropy"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016682","abstract":"A recommendation system can help user to make requirement analysis and to recommend better decision from much complex information.

According to the integration, two variants are proposed. Method is simple and the results are fruitful. Tested on a suite of benchmark functions, unimodal and multimodal functions, justifies the feasibility of the strategy.

The CMAC neural controller is used to mimic system dynamics and the compensation controller is designed to dispel the approximation error. The Lyapunov stability theorem is utilized to derive the parameter learning algorithm, so that the stability of the APICNC system can be guaranteed.

In particular, neural networks, support vector machines (SVM) and decision trees are three significant and popular schemes borrowed from the machine learning community into intrusion detection in recent academic research. However, these machine learning schemes are rarely employed in large-scale practical settings. In this paper, we implement and compare machine learning schemes of neural networks, SVM and decision trees in a uniform environment with the purpose of exploring the practice and issues of using these approaches in detecting abnormal behaviors. With the analysis of experimental results, we claim that the real performance of machine learning algorithms depends heavily on practical context. Therefore, the machine learning approaches are supposed to be applied in an appropriate way in terms of the actual settings.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016798","publicationTitle":"2011 International

The superposition of the interfering signals from W-BSs are considered as Gaussian noise while the interfering signal from S-BS are detected and suppressed based on the principles of the interleave-division-multiple-access (IDMA) scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interleave-division-multiple-access based intercell interference cancellation for cellular OFDM system","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016863","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009138/6016848/06016863.pdf","startPage":"1395","endPage":"1398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016848","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016863","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016863/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Interleave-division-multiple-access based intercell interference cancellation for cellular OFDM system","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6016863/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12268689","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interleave-division-multiple-access based intercell interference cancellation for cellular OFDM system","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"3632.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047649S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009138","isNumber":"6016848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009138","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6016848","articleId":"6016863","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6016866,"authors":[{"name":"Han-Xiao Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Information Engineering, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Han-Xiao","lastName":"Shi","id":"37537778800"},{"name":"Xiao-Jun Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Information Engineering, Zhejiang Gongshang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"37635272400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0308-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0305-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0307-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6016866","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2014},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Machine learning","Presses","Support vector machines","Computational linguistics","Data mining","Semantics","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","document handling","electronic commerce","hotel industry","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","reviews"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sentiment analysis model","computers","Internet","e-commerce","informed decision making","product purchasing","customer opinion management","online hotel reviews","supervised machine learning approach","unigram feature","document polarity classification","TF-IDF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sentiment classification","supervised machine learning","Online reviews"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016866","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016866","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016848","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009138/6016848/06016866.pdf","startPage":"950","endPage":"954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sentiment analysis model for hotel reviews based on supervised learning","abstract":"As the widespread use of computers and the high-speed development of the Internet, E-Commerce has already penetrated as a part of our daily life.

In this paper, we apply five particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms-standard PSO (SPSO), PSO with a constriction factor (PSOCF), Gaussian PSO (GPSO), Gaussian PSO with Gaussian jump (GPSOGJ) and Gaussian PSO with Cauchy jump (GPSOCJ)-to determine the optimal bandwidths. In order to experimentally validate the feasibility and effectiveness of selecting the optimal parameters by using PSO algorithms, we carry out some numerical simulations on four univariate artificial datasets: Uniform dataset, Normal dataset, Exponential dataset and Rayleigh dataset. The finally comparative results show that our strategies are well-performed and Gaussian PSO with jump methods can obtain the better estimations than other PSO algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016868","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009138/6016848/06016868.pdf","startPage":"1362","endPage":"1367","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016848","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying particle swarm optimization to determine the bandwidth parameter in probability density estimation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Applying particle swarm optimization to determine the bandwidth parameter in probability density estimation","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12268694","publicationDate":"July 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6016868/","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying particle swarm optimization to determine the bandwidth parameter in probability density estimation","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"3683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062419S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009138","isNumber":"6016848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009138","xplore-issue":"6016848","articleId":"6016868","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6016884,"authors":[{"name":"Chun-An Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-An","lastName":"Chung","id":"37896401900"},{"name":"Tsu-Tian Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsu-Tian","lastName":"Lee","id":"37277271100"},{"name":"Ching-Cheng Tien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ching-Cheng","lastName":"Tien","id":"37605760300"},{"name":"Chun-Fei Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chun-Fei","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37276771800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0308-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0305-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0307-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6016884","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":184},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016884","abstract":"This paper proposes an adaptive wavelet neural network control (AWNNC) system which is composed of a neural controller and a smooth compensator via second-order sliding-mode approach.

ECG signal measured from the surface of human body is badly effected by different noises like power line noise, muscle noise, lung noise baseline noise. The main causes of baseline noise are breathing, lose sensor contact and body movements. Baseline noise is a low frequency signal. Baseline will disturb the whole cycle of ECG signal but mainly the low frequency part. T-wave is a part of ECG signal related to a phenomenon associated with increased risk of death and baseline wandering may prevent its correct detection. Different algorithm were applied for removal of this noise by different researchers like Kalman filter, Cubic spline, Moving average. We apply projection pursuit gradient ascent algorithm in a previous paper and observe the results in term of standard deviation of the error signal for different types of baseline noises. In this paper I am comparing the results of projection pursuit gradient ascent algorithm (PPGAA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) FASTICA algorithm for removing this noise. Results of FASTICA were also analyzed in the presence of 32db additive Gaussian noise. Then a comparative study of these algorithms was done and results were compared for baseline noise removal.","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016962","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009138/6016945/06016962.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016945","startPage":"1756","endPage":"1761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrocardiogram signal processing for baseline noise removal using blind source separation techniques: A comparative analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Electrocardiogram signal processing for baseline noise removal using blind source separation techniques: A comparative analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016962/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2011","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12268781","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6016962/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrocardiogram signal processing for baseline noise removal using blind source separation techniques: A comparative analysis","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"3538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042729S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009138","isNumber":"6016945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009138","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6016945","articleId":"6016962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6016978,"authors":[{"name":"Wigrai Thanadechteemapat","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Wigrai","lastName":"Thanadechteemapat","id":"37548058500"},{"name":"Chun-Che Fung","affiliation":["School of Information Technology, Murdoch University, Murdoch, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Chun-Che","lastName":"Fung","id":"37396285700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0308-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0305-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0307-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6016978","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tag clouds","Data visualization","Visualization","Internet","Compounds","Web pages"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","feature extraction","image segmentation","natural language processing","Web sites","word processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Thai word segmentation","Thai Web site visualization","information visualization","information overload","tag cloud generation","tag extraction","word extraction","matching technique","Thailand"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Thai Word Segmentation","Tag cloud","Web Page Visualization"]}],"abstract":"Information overload is a problem in the Information Age and Information visualization is an approach to provide an overview of the content of a web site. Tag cloud is one of the ways to represent information as an image of a group of words. However, there are limitations on tag cloud generation, and one of them is due to the characteristics for the language. In order to extract tags or words for tag cloud, word segmentation is required. This paper proposes a Thai word segmentation approach for the visualization of Thai Web sites. The proposed Thai word segmentation technique is based on the longest matching technique together with a refined corpus. The results of Thai word segmentation are compatible with the results from previous BEST's contests in Thailand.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thai word segmentation for visualization of Thai Web sites","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016978","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009138/6016945/06016978.pdf","startPage":"1544","endPage":"1549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016945","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016978","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016978/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"Thai word segmentation for visualization of Thai Web sites","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/6016978/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12268797","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thai word segmentation for visualization of Thai Web sites","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"3661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049407S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009138","isNumber":"6016945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009138","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6016945","articleId":"6016978","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6016995,"authors":[{"name":"Fang-Hsuan Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chun Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Fang-Hsuan","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37345556900"},{"name":"Yu-Wei Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chun Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yu-Wei","lastName":"Chang","id":"37898763500"},{"name":"Yea-Shuan Huang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chun Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yea-Shuan","lastName":"Huang","id":"37536895300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0308-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0305-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0307-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6016995","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stereo image processing","Hardware","Image edge detection","Three dimensional displays","Real time systems","Cameras","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rendering (computer graphics)","stereo image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware architecture","real-time stereoscopic image generation","depth map","parallax","depth-image-based rendering algorithm","image inpainting algorithm","2D image","real-time computing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Depth-image-based rendering","Image inpainting","Hole filling","Stereoscopic Image","Binocular vision"]}],"abstract":"When you look at the object, the displacement of object is different in left and right eye. This displacement is called parallax. The farther the object is, the smaller the parallax become. Due to the parallax, people will have the feeling of stereoscopic vision. We develop a depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) algorithm to shift (or move) the position of the object in the image to generate the stereoscopic image with parallax according to its depth information. When the object is shifted (or moved) away from its original position, a hole will occur in the original position. Therefore we develop an image inpainting algorithm to fill the hole. In this paper, a hardware architecture is designed for real-time stereoscopic image generation from a 2D image and its depth map. In order to achieve the real-time application, we design a hardware architecture to accomplish the DIBR and image inpainting algorithm. There are totally 2,849 logic registers in this design. By simulation in the experiment, we can achieve the real-time computing in 150MHz clock (320 \u00d7 240 @30 fps).","doi":"10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016995","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/6009138/6016945/06016995.pdf","startPage":"1622","endPage":"1627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMLC.2011.6016995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6016945","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware architecture for real-time stereoscopic image generation from depth map","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6016995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6016995/","displayDocTitle":"A hardware architecture for real-time stereoscopic image generation from depth map","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12268814","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6016995/","conferenceDate":"10-13 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware architecture for real-time stereoscopic image generation from depth map","confLoc":"Guilin, China","sourcePdf":"3746.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071341S","chronDate":"10-13 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6009138","isNumber":"6016945","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6009138","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6016945","articleId":"6016995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6017003,"authors":[{"name":"Guan-Chun Luh","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tatung University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guan-Chun","lastName":"Luh","id":"37295064300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0308-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0305-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4577-0307-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-1348"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2160-133X"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-133X"}],"articleNumber":"6017003","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":241},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017003","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Training","Immune system","Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Covariance matrix","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune systems","face recognition","principal component analysis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","PCA based immune networks","single training sample per person","artificial immune networks","principal component analysis","ORL face database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Face recognition","Artificial immune networks","One training sample problem","Principle component analysis","ORL"]}],"abstract":"Numerous methods could deal well with frontal view face recognition if there were sufficient number of representative training samples.

In the restoration phase, we extract the characteristic values according to the random number generator and restore accurately the image even though it had been damaged and tampered by the malicious users. Furthermore, our method enhances the image robustness and quality after the image is recovered. Moreover, the proposed method uses the characteristic similarity of neighbor blocks without tampering and averages their values to replace the middle and high frequency coefficients in the blocks.

The technique first extracts reduced-reference features from multiple regions in the surveillance image, and then detects anomaly events by analyzing variation of features when image quality decreases and field of view changes. Event detection is achieved by statistically calculating accumulated variations along temporal domain. False alarms occurred due to noise are further reduced by an online Kalman filter that can recursively smooth the features. Experiments are conducted on a set of recorded videos simulating various challenging situations.

Our theoretical model relies on first-order perturbation theory approximations applied for the first time to coupled optical switching structures, resulting to an optical RAM cell frequency response that allows for a qualitative and quantitative analysis of optical RAM memory speed and performance characteristics and their dependence on certain RAM cell device parameters. We show that the transfer function of an optical RAM cell and its incorporated flip-flop device exhibits periodic resonance frequencies resembling the behavior of optical ring resonator configurations. Its free spectral range is mainly dictated by the length of the waveguide that enables the coupling of the two SOA-MZI gates, yielding this coupling length as the dominant memory speed determining factor. The obtained results are in close agreement with experimental observations, demonstrating that optimized RAM cell designs with waveguide coupling lengths lower than 5 mm can enable RAM operation at memory speeds well beyond 40 GHz.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2011.2150201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6158729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/6158729/06017088.pdf","endPage":"1015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Speed Analysis of Optical RAM and Optical Flip-Flop Circuits Based on Coupled SOA-MZI Gates","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2011.2150201","startPage":"1006","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017088","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Memory Speed Analysis of Optical RAM and Optical Flip-Flop Circuits Based on Coupled SOA-MZI Gates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017088/","dateOfInsertion":"09 March 2012","accessionNumber":"12577120","publicationDate":"March-April 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6017088/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Speed Analysis of Optical RAM and Optical Flip-Flop Circuits Based on Coupled SOA-MZI Gates","sourcePdf":"jstqe-fitsios-2150201-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085609S","chronDate":"March-April  2012","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"6158729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6158729","articleId":"6017088","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":6017096,"authors":[{"name":"Marko Sonkki","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications (CWC), University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Sonkki","id":"37319817000"},{"name":"Eva Antonino-Daviu","affiliation":["Edificio 8G, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Eva","lastName":"Antonino-Daviu","id":"38270911200"},{"name":"Miguel Ferrando-Bataller","affiliation":["Edificio 8G, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Ferrando-Bataller","id":"38277714700"},{"name":"Erkki T.

Based on this formulation, a variable-frequency optimal DPC algorithm is presented that selects the inverter switching state that minimizes the power error. This algorithm shows an excellent precision in estimating power variations, therefore reducing power ripple and unwanted current harmonics, while retaining the fast dynamics inherent to variable-frequency DPC. This makes this algorithm suitable for interfacing distributed generation to microgrids, where a fast and accurate power control is desirable in order to perform voltage and frequency regulation. Additionally, studies are carried out regarding the average switching frequency and the influence of the model parameters on the algorithm robustness.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2167732","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6361304/06017109.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2167732","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6361304","startPage":"1442","endPage":"1451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Variable-Frequency Optimal Direct Power Control Algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A New Variable-Frequency Optimal Direct Power Control Algorithm","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2013","accessionNumber":"13146456","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6017109/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Variable-Frequency Optimal Direct Power Control Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tie-alonsomartinez-2167732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070597S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6361304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6361304","articleId":"6017109","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6017111,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Castilla","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltru, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6361304/6017111/6017111-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Miguel Castilla received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in telecommunication engineering from the Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain, in 1988, 1995, and 1998, respectively.","Since 2002, he has been an Associate Professor with the Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Vilanova i la Geltr\u00fa, Spain, where he teaches courses on analog circuits and power electronics.

However, the performance of these systems is deteriorated when the utility grid voltage experiences abnormal conditions such as voltage harmonics and imbalances. Several advanced control solutions have been recently introduced to cope with this problem but at the cost of a significant increase in the control computational load. This paper first analyzes the limitations of the standard resonant current control operating under abnormal grid conditions and then introduces a control scheme that improves the current harmonic distortion in such adverse conditions without increasing the computational load of the standard current control. This theoretical contribution is validated by means of selected experimental results from a three-phase PV inverter.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2013","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2013","dateOfInsertion":"22 November 2012","accessionNumber":"13136548","htmlLink":"/document/6017111/","displayDocTitle":"Reduction of Current Harmonic Distortion in Three-Phase Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Inverters via Resonant Current Control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduction of Current Harmonic Distortion in Three-Phase Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Inverters via Resonant Current Control","sourcePdf":"tie-castilla-2167734-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11861S","chronDate":"April  2013","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6361304","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6361304","articleId":"6017111","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6017112,"authors":[{"name":"Angelo Accetta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6058663/6017112/6017112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Angelo Accetta (M'08) received the Laurea degree in electrical engineering from the University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy, in 2008, where he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunications since 2008.","His current research interests are electrical machines, control techniques of electrical drives, intelligent control, power converters, and fuel cell system control and diagnosis."]},"firstName":"Angelo","lastName":"Accetta","id":"37597154400"},{"name":"Maurizio Cirrincione","affiliation":["University of Technology of Belfort-Montb\u00e9liard, Belfort, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6058663/6017112/6017112-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Maurizio Cirrincione (M'03\u2013SM'10) received the Laurea degree in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy, in 1991, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy, in 1996.","From 1996 to 2010, he was a Researcher with the Institute of Intelligent Systems for Automation (ISSIA), National Research Council (CNR), Palermo.

Starting from a speed estimation scheme well known in the literature, this paper proposes the adoption of a neural network (NN) based adaptive variable-band filter instead of a fixed-bandwidth filter, needed for catching the speed information from the sidebands of the stator current. The proposed NN filter is based on a linear NN adaptive linear neuron (ADALINE), trained with a classic least mean squares (LMS) algorithm, and is twice adaptive. From one side, it is adaptive in the sense that its weights are adapted online recursively. From another side, its bandwidth is made adaptive during the running of the drive, acting directly on the learning rate of the NN filter itself. The immediate consequence of adopting a variable-band structure is the possibility to enlarge significantly the working speed range of the sensorless drive, which can be increased by a factor of five. The proposed observer has been tested experimentally on a fractional horsepower PMSM drive and has been compared also with a fixed-bandwidth structure.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2167729","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6058663/06017112.pdf","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2167729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6058663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensorless Control of PMSM Fractional Horsepower Drives by Signal Injection and Neural Adaptive-Band Filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017112/","displayDocTitle":"Sensorless Control of PMSM Fractional Horsepower Drives by Signal Injection and Neural Adaptive-Band Filtering","volume":"59","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2012","accessionNumber":"12308606","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6017112/","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensorless Control of PMSM Fractional Horsepower Drives by Signal Injection and Neural Adaptive-Band Filtering","sourcePdf":"tie-pucci-2167729-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086279S","chronDate":"March  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6058663","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"6058663","articleId":"6017112","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-02"},{"_id":6017116,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Yu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Central University, Jhongli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/6095456/6017116/6017116-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsin-Yu Liu was born in I-Lan, Taiwan, in 1983.

In the human motion data acquisition, we use a webcam to recognize the 13 marks that are pasted on the human's body and then calculate and record the relative positions of the marks for each motion into the motion database. In the motion data modification, the recorded motion data are modified by computer simulation to guarantee that the zero moment point of the robot is inside the stable region. Finally, based on the force sensor measurement on the soles of the robot, the ankle angles of the supporting foot (or feet) are adjusted such that the humanoid robot is capable of imitating the human motion with a balance status in real time.

In this implementation, the two-axis angular velocity of spacecraft is sensed from the control signals in the active-magnetic-bearing control system for a high-speed rotor. Both the current- and displacement-force terms are considered in the proposed scheme in order to achieve a good tracking performance of angular velocity estimation. Furthermore, a dynamic decoupling and static compensation procedure is designed to eliminate the cross-axis angular velocity couplings. The magnetic-force-related parameters which are crucial for the control torque calculations are also experimentally identified. The simulation and experimental results obtained from an originally developed MSDGCMG prototype are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented implementations.","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2011.2164289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel5/19/6119253/06017117.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2011.2164289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119253","startPage":"338","endPage":"348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attitude Sensing and Dynamic Decoupling Based on Active Magnetic Bearing of MSDGCMG","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Attitude Sensing and Dynamic Decoupling Based on Active Magnetic Bearing of MSDGCMG","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12438042","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6017117/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attitude Sensing and Dynamic Decoupling Based on Active Magnetic Bearing of MSDGCMG","sourcePdf":"tim-zheng-2164289-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094084S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"6119253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6119253","articleId":"6017117","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6017120,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Grigorescu","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Elena Grigorescu is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the College of Computing at Georgia Institute of Technology.

The existence of such structured bases has applications in property testing, and motivates our search for a fully explicit description of low weight codewords and, in particular, of codewords that generate a basis for BCH codes. In this paper, we describe the support of basis-generating codewords under affine transformations of the domain for the very specific case of binary (extended) BCH(2, n). We believe that extending these findings to general BCH codes merits further investigation.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2167739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2167739","startPage":"78","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6121971/06017120.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6121971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explicit Low-Weight Bases for BCH Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Explicit Low-Weight Bases for BCH Codes","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12443706","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6017120/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explicit Low-Weight Bases for BCH Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-grigorescu-2167739-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057233S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6121971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6121971","articleId":"6017120","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6017121,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA","Broadcom, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37538647400"},{"name":"Dongning Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Dongning","lastName":"Guo","id":"37272631900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"6017121","dbTime":"38 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":829},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper fully determines the degree-of-freedom (DoF) region of two-user interference channels with arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas in the case of isotropic and independent (or block-wise independent) fading, where the channel state information is available to the receivers but not to the transmitters. Thus, the DoF gap between previous upper and lower bounds due to the authors, Vaze and Varanasi, and Huang, Jafar, Shamai, and Vishwanath is closed. The DoF result characterizes the capacity region to the first order of the logarithm of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the high-SNR regime. The DoF region is achievable by using random Gaussian codebooks independent of the channel states, which implies that it is impossible to increase the DoF using beamforming and interference alignment in the absence of channel state information at the transmitters.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/6121971/06017121.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"352","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2167314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2167314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6121971","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017121","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Degrees of Freedom of Isotropic MIMO Interference Channels Without State Information at the Transmitters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Interference channels","Rayleigh channels","MIMO","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","receivers","receiving antennas","state estimation","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degrees of freedom","isotropic MIMO interference channels","transmitters","two-user interference channels","receive antennas","block-wise independent fading","channel state information","receivers","signal-to-noise ratio","SNR","random Gaussian codebooks","channel states","beamforming","interference alignment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacity region","channel state information","degree of freedom (DoF)","interference channel","isotropic fading","multiple antennas","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel","wireless networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Degrees of Freedom of Isotropic MIMO Interference Channels Without State Information at the Transmitters","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12443707","dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Degrees of Freedom of Isotropic MIMO Interference Channels Without State Information at the Transmitters","sourcePdf":"tit-guo-2167314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039205S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","isNumber":"6121971","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"50","articleId":"6017121","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6017122,"authors":[{"name":"Kenta Kasai","affiliation":["Department of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Kenta Kasai (M'07) received B.E., M.E., and Ph.D. degrees from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo Japan, in 2001, 2003, and 2006, respectively.

In order to select a small subset of informative genes from the data for cancer classification, recently, many researchers are analyzing gene expression data using various computational intelligence methods. However, due to the small number of samples compared to the huge number of genes (high dimension), irrelevant genes, and noisy genes, many of the computational methods face difficulties to select the small subset. Thus, we propose an improved (modified) binary particle swarm optimization to select the small subset of informative genes that is relevant for the cancer classification. In this proposed method, we introduce particles' speed for giving the rate at which a particle changes its position, and we propose a rule for updating particle's positions. By performing experiments on ten different gene expression datasets, we have found that the performance of the proposed method is superior to other previous related works, including the conventional version of binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected genes. The proposed method also produces lower running times compared to BPSO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017123/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","volume":"15","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376498","pubMedId":"21914573","htmlLink":"/document/6017123/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Modified Binary Particle Swarm Optimization for Selecting the Small Subset of Informative Genes From Gene Expression Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modified Binary Particle Swarm Optimization for Selecting the Small Subset of Informative Genes From Gene Expression Data","sourcePdf":"titb-mohamad-2167756-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120814S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"4233","isNumber":"6083501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4233","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6083501","articleId":"6017123","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6017126,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In the developed microgripper, a stack piezoelectric ceramic actuator is used to simultaneously obtain the tip displacement and the gripping force. A novel monolithic compliant mechanism is proposed to act as the microdisplacement transmission mechanism to obtain the large tip displacement and to provide the possibility of integrating both the gripping force sensor and the tip displacement sensor into the microgripper. The relationship between the gripping force, tip displacement, input force, and input displacement of the piezoelectric-driven microgripper and the dynamic model are established using the pseudorigid-body-model method. The characteristics of the developed microgripper are tested and the case of gripping an optical fiber is presented. The experimental results indicate that: 1) the theoretical model for the developed microgripper matched well with the measured results; 2) the integrated gripping force sensor and tip displacement sensor could accurately measure the gripping force and tip displacement; 3) the developed microgripper could achieve a displacement magnification of 16.0 \u00d7 with respect to the stack piezoelectric ceramic actuator to realize the large tip displacement with high resolution but is also able to possess the parallel movement of its gripping jaws and the constant displacement magnification.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Monolithic Compliant Piezoelectric-Driven Microgripper: Design, Modeling, and Testing","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2163200","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6301724/06017126.pdf","startPage":"138","endPage":"147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2163200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6301724","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017126/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2013","displayDocTitle":"A Monolithic Compliant Piezoelectric-Driven Microgripper: Design, Modeling, and Testing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6017126/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2013","accessionNumber":"12982053","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Monolithic Compliant Piezoelectric-Driven Microgripper: Design, Modeling, and Testing","sourcePdf":"tmech-wang-2163200-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09468S","chronDate":"Feb.  2013","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6301724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"6301724","articleId":"6017126","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6017133,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Heriss\u00e9","affiliation":["ONERA\u2014The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau Cedex, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/6145195/6017133/6017133-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bruno H\u00e9riss\u00e9 received the Engineer degree from the \u00c9cole Sup\u00e9rieure d\u2019\u00c9lectricit\u00e9 (SUPELEC), a French \u201cGrande \u00c9cole\u201d of Engineering in energy and information science, Paris, France, in 2007, and the Research Master degree in signal, telecommunications, and image processing from SUPELEC in joint authorization with the University of Rennes 1, Rennes, France, in 2007.

More specifically, a synchronous multiuser scenario is considered. The main technical contributions of this paper are given as follows: Two receiver structures based on the maximum-likelihood (ML) criterion of optimality are developed and analytically studied, i.e., single- and multiuser detectors. Accurate frameworks for computing the average bit error probability (ABEP) over independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Rayleigh fading channels are proposed. Furthermore, simple and easy-to-use lower and upper bounds for performance analysis and system design are introduced. The frameworks account for the near-far effect, which significantly affects the achievable performance in multiple-access environments. In addition, we extend the analysis to generalized SSK (GSSK) modulation, which foresees multiple active antennas at the transmitter. With respect to SSK modulation, GSSK modulation achieves higher data rates at the cost of increased complexity at the transmitter. The performance of SSK and GSSK modulations is compared with that of conventional phase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) schemes, and it is shown that SSK and GSSK modulations can outperform conventional schemes for various system setups and channel conditions. In particular, the performance gain of SSK and GSSK modulations increases for increasing values of the target bit rate and of the number of antennas at the receiver. Finally, we put forth the concept of coordinated multipoint (or network MIMO) SSK (CoMP-SSK) modulation as a way of exploiting network cooperation and the spatial-constellation diagram to achieve high data rates. Analytical derivations and theoretical findings are substantiated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations for many setups.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/06017140.pdf","startPage":"3694","endPage":"3711","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2167636","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2167636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017140","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit Error Probability of Space-Shift Keying MIMO Over Multiple-Access Independent Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Interference","Receivers","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Probes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MIMO communication","Monte Carlo methods","multiuser detection","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-shift keying modulation","multiple access independent fading channels","MIMO communication","multiple-access interference","synchronous multiuser scenario","maximum likelihood criterion","multiuser detectors","average bit error probability","Rayleigh fading channels","performance analysis","near-far effect","phase-shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","coordinated multipoint SSK modulation","network cooperation","spatial-constellation diagram","Monte Carlo simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bounds","multiple-access fading channels","multiple-input\u2013multiple-output (MIMO) wireless systems","performance analysis","space-shift keying (SSK) modulation","spatial modulation (SM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Bit Error Probability of Space-Shift Keying MIMO Over Multiple-Access Independent Fading Channels","volume":"60","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12291127","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit Error Probability of Space-Shift Keying MIMO Over Multiple-Access Independent Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-direnzo-2167636-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0435S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"78","articleId":"6017140","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6017141,"authors":[{"name":"Eonpyo Hong","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Eonpyo","lastName":"Hong","id":"37408571800"},{"name":"Dongsoo Har","affiliation":["School of Information and Communications, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dongsoo","lastName":"Har","id":"37282432300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"6017141","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":552},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Silicon","Time domain analysis","Computational complexity","Indexes","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","error statistics","fading channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM system","peak-to-average power ratio reduction","PAPR","single high order adaptive all pass filter","phase rotation","time domain orthogonal frequency division multiplexing symbol","computational complexity","selected mapping","static all pass filter bank","bit error rate performance","smooth phase transition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive all-pass filter (AAPF)","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","steepest descent (SD) method"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction scheme adopting a single high-order adaptive all-pass filter (AAPF). The phase rotation of time-domain orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbol, corresponding to reduced PAPR, is obtained by the single AAPF. Comparison of computational complexity and PAPR reduction performance with the selected mapping (SLM) scheme, the static all-pass filter bank scheme, and the low-complexity (LC) SLM scheme suggests that the computational complexity of the AAPF scheme is comparable with that of the LC-SLM scheme and that the PAPR reduction performance is competitive to the SLM scheme. Simulation results for bit error rate (BER) performance show that the smooth phase transition caused by the AAPF enables data recovery without side information.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2167766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6045674/06017141.pdf","startPage":"4029","endPage":"4034","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2167766","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6045674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive All-Pass Filter Achieving Low Peak-to-Average Power Ratio for OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017141/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive All-Pass Filter Achieving Low Peak-to-Average Power Ratio for OFDM Systems","volume":"60","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12291128","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6017141/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive All-Pass Filter Achieving Low Peak-to-Average Power Ratio for OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-hong-2167766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07746S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6045674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6045674","articleId":"6017141","onlineDate":"12 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6017172,"authors":[{"name":"Rodrigo Roman","affiliation":["University of Malaga, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Rodrigo Roman is a researcher at the University of Malaga, Spain.

This lab-on-CMOS process achieves high packing density and is suitable for batch production, opening new opportunities for next generation lab-on-chip devices.","doi":"10.1109/NEMS.2011.6017448","publicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 6th IEEE International Conference on Nano/Micro Engineered and Molecular Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/6008678/6017279/06017448.pdf","startPage":"690","endPage":"693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NEMS.2011.6017448","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lab-on-CMOS: Integrating microfluidics and electrochemical sensor on CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6017448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Feb. 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6017448/","displayDocTitle":"Lab-on-CMOS: Integrating microfluidics and electrochemical sensor on CMOS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"12229710","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6017448/","conferenceDate":"20-23 Feb. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lab-on-CMOS: Integrating microfluidics and electrochemical sensor on CMOS","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"0256attachment.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061142S","chronDate":"20-23 Feb. 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6008678","isNumber":"6017279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6008678","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6017279","articleId":"6017448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":6017547,"authors":[{"name":"Shiyuan Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Digital Manufacturing Equipment and Technology, Wuhan National Laboratory of Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Shiyuan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292597300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-777-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-775-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-776-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6017547","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"abstract":"Nanomanufacturing refers to the manufacturing of products with feature dimensions at the nanometer scale.

This method potentially allows soldiers on the battlefield to locate the source of an acoustic wave produced by gunfire or other sources. The simulation has been demonstrated to accurately find the location of the acoustic waves, but required hours to compute the solution. For practical use in the future, the simulation must run quickly to allow soldiers to find the location of their attacker before the attacker can leave the area, requiring us to accelerate the code to produce a solution in a reasonable amount of time. The simulation code requires many independent computations for each element of a large 2D grid. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) perform best for highly-parallel and computationally-intense problems, making this an ideal simulation to compute using GPUs to significantly reduce the running time. GPUs also allow the solution to be obtained locally (with the soldiers) rather than at a centralized high performance computing center. This work develops a GPU version of the 2D-FDTD code and experiments with a variety of optimizations to produce an accurate solution as quickly as possible. GPU-only and CPU-GPU versions are developed, with the CPU-GPU version showing slightly better performance. Careful selection of thread block parameters is needed to load data from memory as quickly as possible. Over 11 times speedups are produced, providing progress towards a solution that can allow people on the battlefield to locate the source of gunfire and other projectiles in close to real-time.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6017277/6017975/06018037.pdf","startPage":"350","endPage":"356","publicationTitle":"2010 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","doi":"10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2010.43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2010.43","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acceleration of 2-D Finite Difference Time Domain Acoustic Wave Simulation Using GPUs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing unit","Boundary conditions","Instruction sets","Arrays","Memory management","Finite difference methods","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic wave propagation","coprocessors","finite difference time-domain analysis","military computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D finite difference time domain acoustic wave simulation","GPU","two-dimensional finite difference time domain simulation","source location","time-reversal technique","graphics processing units"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD","GPU","Acoustics","CUDA","HPC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Acceleration of 2-D Finite Difference Time Domain Acoustic Wave Simulation Using GPUs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6018037/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"12244691","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acceleration of 2-D Finite Difference Time Domain Acoustic Wave Simulation Using GPUs","confLoc":"Schaumburg, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4392a350.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062666S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"6017277","isNumber":"6017975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6017277","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6017975","articleId":"6018037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6018041,"authors":[{"name":"Spencer E.

Applications for such an amplifier include three-dimensional (3D) imaging systems for medical uses, detection of concealed hazardous materials, and high-bandwidth communications. An optimization framework was developed for the DoD Supercomputing Resource Center (DSRC) environment to automatically queue and track many simultaneous thousand CPU hour jobs. Results were automatically evaluated, collated, and used to refine simulations, thus saving many man-hours otherwise used for performing parameter scans and analysis. Prior efforts typically required thousands of manually submitted jobs over the course of three years, and resulted in a design that did not meet the desired specifications, e.g., the electron-gun (e-gun) component produced a noisy 4.4 mA, 150 \u03bcm diameter electron beam which fed into a 13 dB amplifier that exhibited detrimental backwards-wave oscillations. The automated effort produced thousands of runs over a month and met the design goals with an e-gun providing a low-noise, 10 mA, 100 \u03bcm diameter electron beam feeding into a 21 dB amplifier with no backwards-wave oscillations. The work presented here involved thousands of runs consuming around 3.8 million CPU hours.

Contemporary field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are now equipped with multimillion gate logic fabrics, faster clock rates, reasonably large on-chip memory, and fast I/O resources for off-chip communication. The use of FPGAs as reconfigurable computational units complementing a fixed computational device such as a general-purpose processor (GPP) is the basic idea behind what are known as high performance reconfigurable computers (HPRCs). These exciting architectures allow development of reconfigurable processors that target the computationally intensive parts of a given application. Ideally, one should use a high-level language (HLL) rather than a hardware description language (HDL) to implement HPRC-based applications. However, in order to accelerate some applications, an HDL must be used to design computational kernels. The HPRC used in the joint research project between the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center {DoD Supercomputing} Resource Center (ERDC DSRC) and Jackson State University (JSU) employs the SRC Computers' Carte development environment. Carte allows application development using a conventional HLL, an HLL-to-HDL compiler, and custom-built VHDL-based kernels (\"user macros\" in SRC parlance). Currently, the off-the-shelf Carte mechanism for incorporating user macros does not directly support the common case of a multiple file VHDL hierarchy. This research explores a novel approach that allows multiple file VHDL kernels to be mapped onto the SRC-7 HPRC. The approach facilitates the development of FPGA-based elements via a hybrid technique that uses the Carte HLL-to-HDL compiler in conjunction with multiple file VHDL-based user macros. This paper describes the use of this novel approach to map a parameterized, parallelized, and pipelined FPGA-based sparse matrix vector multiply kernel onto an SRC-7 HPRC. The HPRC-based version runs nearly four times faster than the software-only version.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mapping Hierarchical Multiple File VHDL Kernels onto an SRC-7 High Performance Reconfigurable Computer","publicationTitle":"2010 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","doi":"10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2010.31","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 DoD High Performance Computing Modernization Program Users Group Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/6017277/6017975/06018052.pdf","startPage":"524","endPage":"533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPCMP-UGC.2010.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017975","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Mapping Hierarchical Multiple File VHDL Kernels onto an SRC-7 High Performance Reconfigurable Computer","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6018052/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"12244701","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mapping Hierarchical Multiple File VHDL Kernels onto an SRC-7 High Performance Reconfigurable Computer","confLoc":"Schaumburg, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"4392a524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073057S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"6017277","isNumber":"6017975","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6017277","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6017975","articleId":"6018052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6018239,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-6727-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6018239","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10064},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE standards","Smart grids","Power system planning","Interoperability","Information technology","Power system reliability","Computer security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","open systems","power system reliability","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy technology","information technology operation","electric power system","EPS","smart grid interoperability reference model","SGIRM","integrated architectural perspective","communication technology","data flow characteristics","functional interface identification","logical connection","digital information management","power generation usage","electric load","IEEE std 2030-2011"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["communications technology","controls","cyber security","distributed resources","electric infrastructure and reliability","electric power system","electricity customers and loads","EPS","grid architecture","grid operations","IEEE 2030(R)","information technology","interconnection","interfaces","interoperability","power systems","SCADA","SGIRM","Smart Grid","smart grid reference model"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2030-2011 - IEEE Guide for Smart Grid Interoperability of Energy Technology and Information Technology Operation with the Electric Power System (EPS), End-Use Applications, and Loads","doi":"10.1109/IEEESTD.2011.6018239","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6018238","endPage":"126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Std 2030-2011","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Std 2030-2011","pdfPath":"/iel5/6018237/6018238/06018239.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.2011.6018239","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018239","abstract":"IEEE Std 2030 provides alternative approaches and best practices for achieving smart grid interoperability.

IEEE Std 2030 establishes the smart grid interoperability reference model (SGIRM) and provides a knowledge base addressing terminology, characteristics, functional performance and evaluation criteria, and the application of engineering principles for smart grid interoperability of the electric power system with end-use applications and loads. A system of systems approach to smart grid interoperability lays the foundation on which IEEE Std 2030 establishes the SGIRM as a design tool that inherently allows for extensibility, scalability, and upgradeability. The IEEE 2030 SGIRM defines three integrated architectural perspectives: power systems, communications technology, and information technology. Additionally, it defines design tables and the classification of data flow characteristics necessary for interoperability. Guidelines for smart grid interoperability, design criteria, and reference model applications are addressed with emphasis on functional interface identification, logical connections and data flows, communications and linkages, digital information management, and power generation usage.","versions":[{}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 10 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Standard","standardNumber":"2030-2011","publicationDate":"10 Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12301592","purpose":"This document provides guidelines in understanding and defining smart grid interoperability of the EPS with end-use applications and loads.

Sensor data is transmitted to an estimation-control unit over a network and control commands are issued to subsystems over the same network. Sensor and control packets may be randomly lost according to a Bernoulli process. In this context, the discrete-time linear quadratic gaussian (LQG) optimal control problem is considered. In Schenato , a complete analysis was carried out for the case that sensor measurements and control inputs are delivered into a single packet to the estimator and to the actuators respectively. Here, a nontrivial generalization for MIMO systems is presented under the assumption that each sensor and each actuator exchange data with the control unit in an independent way by using their own data packet (no aggregation). In such a framework, it is shown that the separation principle still holds in the case where packet arrivals are acknowledged by the receiver. Moreover, the optimal LQG control is a linear function of the state that explicitly depends on the loss probabilities of the actuator channels. Such a dependence is not present in the single channel case considered in mean-square. In the infinite horizon case, stability conditions on the packet arrival probabilities are provided in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs).","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2167789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6139300/06018252.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2167789","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139300","startPage":"450","endPage":"456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LQG Control for MIMO Systems Over Multiple Erasure Channels With Perfect Acknowledgment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018252","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LQG Control for MIMO Systems Over Multiple Erasure Channels With Perfect Acknowledgment","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018252/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12490233","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6018252/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LQG Control for MIMO Systems Over Multiple Erasure Channels With Perfect Acknowledgment","sourcePdf":"tac-sinopoli-2167789-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068483S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6139300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"6139300","articleId":"6018252","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6018253,"authors":[{"name":"Minghui Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6111555/6018253/6018253-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minghui Zhu (M'11) received the B.E. degree (with honors) in mechanical engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2004, the M.Phil. in mechanical engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, in 2006, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of California, San Diego (UC San Diego), La Jolla.","His main research interests include nonlinear control, and distributed control, optimization and information processing in networked multi-agent systems.","Mr. Zhu received the Powell Fellowship from 2007 to 2010 and the Back Fellowship from 2007 to 2008 at UC San Diego."]},"firstName":"Minghui","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37536924500"},{"name":"Sonia Martinez","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/6111555/6018253/6018253-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Sonia Mart\u00ednez (SM'08) received the Ph.D. degree in engineering mathematics from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, Spain, in 2002.","She is an Associate Professor at the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla.

In particular, we study two cases: one where the equality constraint is absent, and the other where the local constraint sets are identical. We devise two distributed primal-dual subgradient algorithms based on the characterization of the primal-dual optimal solutions as the saddle points of the Lagrangian and penalty functions. These algorithms can be implemented over networks with dynamically changing topologies but satisfying a standard connectivity property, and allow the agents to asymptotically agree on optimal solutions and optimal values of the optimization problem under the Slater's condition.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6111555/06018253.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"164","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2167817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2167817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018253","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Distributed Convex Optimization Under Inequality and Equality Constraints","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lagrangian functions","Algorithm design and analysis","Heuristic algorithms","Convex functions","Optimization","Network topology","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","minimisation","multi-agent systems","multi-robot systems","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed convex optimization","global inequality constraint","global equality constraint","multiagent convex optimization problem","global objective function minimization","global constraint set","local constraint set intersection","distributed primal-dual subgradient algorithms","saddle points","Lagrangian functions","penalty functions","standard connectivity property","Slater condition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative control","distributed optimization","multi-agent systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018253/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"On Distributed Convex Optimization Under Inequality and Equality Constraints","volume":"57","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6018253/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12426141","dateOfInsertion":"27 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Distributed Convex Optimization Under Inequality and Equality Constraints","sourcePdf":"tac-zhu-2167817-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116239S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6111555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"405","xplore-issue":"6111555","articleId":"6018253","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":6018254,"authors":[{"name":"Hattan F.

It occupies a compact volume of 50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 1.57 (3925 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n), including the ground plane. The antenna can operate in two dual-band modes and a wideband mode from 5 to 7 GHz. Two parallel C-Slots on the patch elements are employed to perturb the surface current paths for excitation of the dual-band and the wideband modes. Two switches, implemented using PIN diodes, are placed on the connecting lines of a simple feed network to the patch elements. Dual-band modes are achieved by switching \u201cON\u201d either one of the two patch elements, while the wideband mode with an impedance bandwidth of 33.52% is obtained by switching \u201cON\u201d both patch elements. The frequencies in the dual-band modes can be independently controlled using positions and dimensions of the C-Slots without affecting the wideband mode. The advantage of the proposed antenna is that two dual-band operations and one wideband operation can be achieved using the same dimensions. This overcomes the need for increasing the surface area normally incurred when designing wideband patch antennas. Simulation results are validated experimentally through prototypes. The measured radiation patterns and peak gains show stable responses and are in good agreements. Coupling between the two patch elements plays a major role for achieving the wide bandwidth and the effects of mutual coupling between the patch elements are also studied.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6119107/06018254.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"43","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2167925","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2167925","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable Wideband and Multiband Antenna Using Dual-Patch Elements for Compact Wireless Devices","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wideband","Dual band","Antenna measurements","Broadband antennas","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","microstrip antennas","p-i-n diodes","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable wideband antenna","multiband antenna","dual-patch elements","compact wireless devices","multiband C-Slot patch antenna","dual-band modes","parallel C-Slots","surface current paths","wideband modes","PIN diodes","wideband patch antennas","peak gains","mutual coupling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["C-slot","cognitive radio","patch antenna","reconfigurable antenna","slot antenna","small antenna","switched antenna","wideband antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable Wideband and Multiband Antenna Using Dual-Patch Elements for Compact Wireless Devices","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6018254/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12438121","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable Wideband and Multiband Antenna Using Dual-Patch Elements for Compact Wireless Devices","sourcePdf":"tap-abutarboush-2167925-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065559S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6119107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6119107","articleId":"6018254","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6018258,"authors":[{"name":"Efstratios Doumanis","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen's University, Belfast, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6119107/6018258/6018258-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Efstratios Doumanis (M\u203211) graduated from the Electrical and Computer Engineering School in the Democritus University of Thrace, Greece, in April 2005, and received the Ph.D. degree from Queen's University of Belfast, Belfast, U.K., in 2010.","In 1998, he joined KFKI Research Institute for Particle and Nuclear Physics, Department of Space Technology, Budapest, Hungary, as student Engineer.

Recently, spatial-spectral EE (SSEE) algorithms have been proposed to achieve superior performance over spectral EE (SEE) algorithms by taking both spectral similarity and spatial context into account. However, these algorithms tend to neglect anomalous endmembers that are also of interest. Therefore, in this paper, an improved SSEE (iSSEE) algorithm is proposed to address such limitation of conventional SSEE algorithms by accounting for both anomalous and normal endmembers. By developing simplex projection and simplex complementary projection, all the hyperspectral pixels are projected into a simplex determined by the normal endmembers extracted in conventional SSEE algorithms. As a result, anomalous endmembers are identified iteratively by utilizing the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">l</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</sup>\n norm to find the maximum simplex complementary projection. In order to determine how many anomalous endmembers are to be extracted, a novel Residual-be-Noise Probability-based algorithm is also proposed by elegantly utilizing the spatial-purity map generated in the previous SSEE step. Experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that simplex projection errors can be significantly reduced by identifying both anomalous and normal endmembers in the proposed iSSEE algorithm. It is also confirmed that the performance of the proposed iSSEE algorithm clearly outperforms that of SEE algorithms since both spatial context and spectral similarity are utilized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Spatial\u2013Spectral Endmember Extraction in the Presence of Anomalous Ground Objects","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2163160","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6059695/06018294.pdf","startPage":"4210","endPage":"4222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2163160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6059695","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018294","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018294/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Improving Spatial\u2013Spectral Endmember Extraction in the Presence of Anomalous Ground Objects","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6018294/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12317818","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Spatial\u2013Spectral Endmember Extraction in the Presence of Anomalous Ground Objects","sourcePdf":"tgrs-he-2163160-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105346S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6059695","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"6059695","articleId":"6018294","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6018297,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Besiris","affiliation":["The Electronics Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6133465/6018297/6018297-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dimitrios Basiris was born in Agrinio, Greece, in 1978.

Two-dimensional velocity retrieval can be achieved by estimation of the Doppler center frequency and Doppler frequency rate for the range and azimuth velocity components, respectively. The Doppler spectrum along a Doppler phase history line in the time-frequency domain was reconstructed and projected onto the frequency and time dimensions. The peak of the frequency axis projected spectrum corresponds to the Doppler center frequency, while that of the time axis indicates an azimuth time of closest approach. The Doppler frequency rate is obtained by measuring the slope of the Doppler spectrum in the time-frequency domain. Simulation using TerraSAR-X and Envisat ASAR parameters indicated that the velocity errors were less than 1 m/s or 5% for moving objects with a velocity higher than 3 m/s. While the measurement of Doppler center frequency was reliable over the entire velocity range, errors in Doppler frequency rate became large if the velocity was slower than 3 m/s (or 10.8 km/h). Range migration correction plays a key role for the precision of Doppler parameter estimation. An experiment using TerraSAR-X and truck-mounted corner reflectors validated the measurement accuracy of the approach. The absolute and percent errors of the range velocity (49.6 km/h) were 1.4 km/h and 2.8%, respectively, and the azimuth velocity (23.8 km/h) measurement was comparatively accurate, with a percent error of 1.8% under an assumption of zero acceleration. To apply the method to single-look complex data, the full Doppler bandwidth must be preserved.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Method of Doppler Parameter Estimation in the Time\u2013Frequency Domain for a Moving Object From TerraSAR-X Data","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162631","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6079321/06018298.pdf","startPage":"4771","endPage":"4787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6079321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018298","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018298/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"22 December 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Method of Doppler Parameter Estimation in the Time\u2013Frequency Domain for a Moving Object From TerraSAR-X Data","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6018298/","dateOfInsertion":"22 December 2011","publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12376465","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Method of Doppler Parameter Estimation in the Time\u2013Frequency Domain for a Moving Object From TerraSAR-X Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-won-2162631-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087707S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6079321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"6079321","articleId":"6018298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6018300,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Jianxiong","affiliation":["ATR Laboratory, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/6029684/6018300/6018300-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhou Jianxiong was born in Xiangtan, China, in 1977.

The scattering center model is established offline using range profiles at multiple viewing angles, so the original data amount is much less than that required for establishing SAR image templates. Scattering center features at different target poses can be conveniently predicted by this model. Moreover, the model can be modified to predict features for various target configurations. For the SAR image to be classified, regional features in different levels are extracted by thresholding and morphological operations. The regional features will be matched to the predicted scattering center features of different targets to arrive at a decision. This region-to-point matching is much easier to implement and is less sensitive to nonideal factors such as noise and pose estimation error than point-to-point matching. A matching scheme going through from coarse to fine regional features in the inner cycle and going through different pose hypotheses in the outer cycle is designed to improve the efficiency and robustness of the classifier. Experiments using both data predicted by a high-frequency electromagnetic (EM) code and data measured in the MSTAR program verify the validity of the method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Solid modeling","Feature extraction","Predictive models","Data models","Computational modeling","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image classification","image matching","object detection","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic target recognition","SAR image","global scattering center model","synthetic aperture radar","target configuration","morphological operation","scattering center feature extraction","region-to-point matching","pose estimation error","point-to-point matching","high-frequency electromagnetic code","MSTAR program"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ground target","model based","scattering center","synthetic aperture radar (SAR) automatic target recognition (ATR)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/6029684/06018300.pdf","startPage":"3713","endPage":"3729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6029684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2011.2162526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Target Recognition of SAR Images Based on Global Scattering Center Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Target Recognition of SAR Images Based on Global Scattering Center Model","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018300/","volume":"49","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6018300/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12245283","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Target Recognition of SAR Images Based on Global Scattering Center Model","sourcePdf":"tgrs-jianxiong-2162526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086583S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"6029684","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"6029684","articleId":"6018300","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-05"},{"_id":6018301,"authors":[{"name":"Ren C.

This study designs a mobile sensor node platform to achieve a highly accurate localization mechanism by using ultrasonic, dead reckoning, and radio frequency information which is processed through a particle filter algorithm. Mobile sensor node with accurate localization ability is of great interest to basic research works and applications, such as sensor deployment, coverage management, dynamic power management, etc. In this paper, we propose an efficient mobile sensor node deployment method, grid deployment, where the map is divided into multiple individual grids and the weight of each grid is determined by environmental factors such as predeployed nodes, boundaries, and obstacles. The grid with minimum values is the goal of the mobile node. We also design an asynchronous power management strategy in our sensor node to reduce power consumption of the sensor network. Several factors such as probability of event generation, battery status, coverage issues, and communication situations have also been taken into consideration. In network communication, we propose an asynchronous awakening scheme so that each node is free to switch on or off its components according to observed event statistics and make a tradeoff between communication and power consumption. The deepest sleep state period is determined by the residual power. By combining these methods, the power consumption of the sensor node can be reduced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"59","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2012","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2012","accessionNumber":"12508913","htmlLink":"/document/6018301/","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Sensor Node Deployment and Asynchronous Power Management for Wireless Sensor Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Sensor Node Deployment and Asynchronous Power Management for Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2167889-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068333S","chronDate":"May  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6142654","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"6142654","articleId":"6018301","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6018303,"authors":[{"name":"Gulnara Zhabelova","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6142654/6018303/6018303-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gulnara Zhabelova received the B.E. degree in mechatronics and robotics and the M.E. degree in automation and control from Karaganda State Technical University, Karaganda, Kazakhstan, in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and the M.E. degree in computer systems from The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, where she is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering.","Her research interests are in the area of distributed agent-based automation and simulation in Smart Grid."]},"firstName":"Gulnara","lastName":"Zhabelova","id":"37399230000"},{"name":"Valeriy Vyatkin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6142654/6018303/6018303-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Valeriy Vyatkin (SM'04) received the Engineer degree in applied mathematics and the Ph.D. and Dr. Sci. degrees from Taganrog State University of Radio Engineering (TSURE), Taganrog, Russia, in 1988, 1992, and 1998, respectively, and the Dr. Eng. degree from Nagoya Institute of Technology, Nagoya, Japan, in 1999.","He is currently an Associate Professor and the Director of the Infomechatronics and Industrial Automation Laboratory at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.

However, constraints on memory, speed, and energy currently limit the processing capabilities within a sensor network. In this paper, we describe how ultra-low-power analog circuitry can be integrated with sensor nodes to create energy-efficient sensor networks. To demonstrate this concept, we present a custom analog front-end which performs spectral analysis at a fraction of the power used by a digital counterpart. Furthermore, we show that the front-end can be combined with existing sensor nodes to 1) selectively wake up the mote based upon spectral content of the signal, thus increasing battery life without missing interesting events, and to 2) achieve low-power signal analysis using an analog spectral decomposition block, freeing up digital computation resources for higher-level analysis. Experiments in the context of vehicle classification show improved performance for our ASP-interfaced mote over an all-digital implementation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018315/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","volume":"1","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6018315/","accessionNumber":"12331854","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Hibernets: Energy-Efficient Sensor Networks Using Analog Signal Processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hibernets: Energy-Efficient Sensor Networks Using Analog Signal Processing","sourcePdf":"jetcas-graham-2164996-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.136148S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6069922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6069922","articleId":"6018315","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6018318,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Yen Ho","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6056707/6018318/6018318-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chen-Yen Ho (S'08) was born in Taipei, Taiwan.

The recently developed iterative reliability-based majority-logic NB-LDPC decoding has better performance-complexity tradeoffs than previous algorithms. This paper first proposes enhancement schemes to the iterative hard reliability-based majority-logic decoding (IHRB-MLGD). Compared to the IHRB algorithm, our enhanced (E-)IHRB algorithm can achieve significant coding gain with small hardware overhead. Then low-complexity partial-parallel NB-LDPC decoder architectures are developed based on these two algorithms. Many existing NB-LDPC code construction methods lead to quasi-cyclic or cyclic codes. Both types of codes are considered in our design. Moreover, novel schemes are developed to keep a small proportion of messages in order to reduce the memory requirement without causing noticeable performance loss. In addition, a shift-message structure is proposed by using memories concatenated with variable node units to enable efficient partial-parallel decoding for cyclic NB-LDPC codes. Compared to previous designs based on the Min-max decoding algorithm, our proposed decoders have at least tens of times lower complexity with moderate coding gain loss.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018324/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","volume":"20","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12884067","dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2012","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","htmlLink":"/document/6018324/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-Complexity Reliability-Based Message-Passing Decoder Architectures for Non-Binary LDPC Codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Complexity Reliability-Based Message-Passing Decoder Architectures for Non-Binary LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-cai-2164951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133749S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6252108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6252108","articleId":"6018324","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6018325,"authors":[{"name":"Weiguo Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Weiguo","lastName":"Tang","id":"37599120100"},{"name":"Jie Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37407359000"},{"name":"Lei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293100600"},{"name":"Shengli Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Shengli","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37276854700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-8210"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9999"}],"articleNumber":"6018325","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":934},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://www.sscs.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Parity check codes","Galois fields","Adaptive control","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","decoding","parity check codes","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonbinary LDPC decoder architecture","adaptive message control","power consumption","horizontal sequential nonbinary LDPC decoder","arithmetic operations","memory access","belief information","message length","low decoding complexity","VLSI implementation","hardware operational complexity","nonbinary low-density parity check codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","decoding","Galois field","Min-Sum","nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","VLSI architecture"]}],"abstract":"A new decoder architecture for nonbinary low-density paritycheck (LDPC) codes is presented in this paper to reduce the hardware operational complexity in VLSI implementations. The low decoding complexity is achieved by employing adaptive message control (AMC) that dynamically trims the message length of belief information to reduce the amount of memory accesses and arithmetic operations. To implement the proposed AMC, we develop the architecture of a horizontal sequential nonbinary LDPC decoder. Key components in the architecture have been designed with the consideration of variable message lengths to leverage the benefit of the proposed AMC. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed nonbinary LDPC decoder architecture can significantly reduce hardware operations and power consumption as compared with existing work with negligible performance degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2165346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6252108/06018325.pdf","startPage":"2118","endPage":"2122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6252108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2165346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nonbinary LDPC Decoder Architecture With Adaptive Message Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2012","displayDocTitle":"A Nonbinary LDPC Decoder Architecture With Adaptive Message Control","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018325/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"27 July 2012","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12884068","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6018325/","volume":"20","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonbinary LDPC Decoder Architecture With Adaptive Message Control","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-tang-2165346-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127071S","chronDate":"Nov.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6252108","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6252108","articleId":"6018325","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6018719,"authors":[{"name":"Mehdi Masoomi","affiliation":["K.

However, application of IT in economic field is very limited. Stability and healthiness of a country's economy directly connects with the accuracy of forecasted Inflation rate. With the recession raised at end of year 2008, world communities pay much attention on inflation and put huge efforts to predict it accurately. Neural networking and data mining are two IT techniques that are commonly used in forecasting and hidden pattern recognition. We have applied both of these techniques to the theoretically sound data set with the intention of identifying most appropriate IT forecasting technique for forecasting the inflation rate. Since forecasted inflation rate directly link with country's monetary policy, accuracy of predictions is very significant. Further continuity of government as well as the economy depends on these decisions. Through this study we were able to identify appropriate characteristics of neural networks and Data mining techniques in case of forecasting inflation rate with high accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018807/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12244018","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6018807/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","conferenceDate":"28-30 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Which is better for inflation forecasting?

Other than the puncturing and extending techniques, shortening aims to remove certain information columns, i.e., the columns standing for the known information bits, from a given parity check matrix. In this paper, we first review the recently suggested largest-extrinsic-sum (LES) algorithm which is especially designed for quasic-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes, and then propose a method based on smallest-row-variance priority (SRVP). Moreover, we obtain both theoretical analysis and simulation results of the codes in 802.11n and 802.16e standards, which shows that: 1) the proposed SRVP algorithm always achieves better Eb/No threshold than the existing LES algorithm and generally, the shortened codes outperform the original codes; 2) severe performance degradation occurs when too many information bits are shortened for low rate codes. The proposed algorithm as well as the corresponding performance evaluations is instructive to practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2011.6018855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6018840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2011.6018855","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/6018840/06018855.pdf","startPage":"1057","endPage":"1063","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved shortening algorithm for irregular QC-LDPC codes using known bits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Improved shortening algorithm for irregular QC-LDPC codes using known bits","volume":"57","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6018855/","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12228349","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018855/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved shortening algorithm for irregular QC-LDPC codes using known bits","sourcePdf":"p1057-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083648S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6018840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6018840","articleId":"6018855","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6018857,"authors":[{"name":"Wasinee Noonpakdee","affiliation":["Graduate School of Global Information and Telecommunication Studies, Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6018840/6018857/6018857-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Wasinee Noonpakdee received her B.E. degree in electronics engineering from Chulalongkorn University, Thailand, in 1999 and M.ISM. degree in information systems management from Carnegie Mellon University, USA, in 2004.

In this paper, we present a flash translation layer called zFTL, which reduces the amount of data written to NAND flash memory by supporting on-line, transparent data compression based on the X-Match algorithm. To minimize compression overhead and power consumption, we also propose a novel prediction scheme that identifies incompressible data in advance without going through full compression. Our evaluations with five real-world workloads show that zFTL successfully enhances storage performance and lifetime by improving the write amplification factor (WAF) by a factor of 2.6 (geometric mean) compared to the case without compression support.

We propose a technology detecting and tracking multiple moving objects, which can be applied to consumer electronics such as home and business surveillance systems consisting of an internet protocol (IP) camera and a network video recorder (NVR). A real-time surveillance system needs to detect moving objects robustly against noises and environment. So the proposed method uses the red-green-blue (RGB) color background modeling with a sensitivity parameter to extract moving regions, the morphology to eliminate noises, and the blob-labeling to group moving objects. To track moving objects fast, the proposed method predicts the velocity and the direction of the groups formed by moving objects. Finally, the experiments show that the proposed method has the robustness against the environmental influences and the speed, which are suitable for the real- time surveillance system.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2011.6018870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/6018840/06018870.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2011.6018870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6018840","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1170","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast and robust algorithm of tracking multiple moving objects for intelligent video surveillance systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast and robust algorithm of tracking multiple moving objects for intelligent video surveillance systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12228364","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6018870/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and robust algorithm of tracking multiple moving objects for intelligent video surveillance systems","sourcePdf":"p1165-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050942S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6018840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"6018840","articleId":"6018870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6018897,"authors":[{"name":"Aydin Aysu","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6018840/6018897/6018897-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Aydin Aysu received B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electronics Engineering from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey in 2008 and 2010 respectively.

Therefore, in this paper, a low complexity H.264 MRF ME algorithm and a low energy adaptive hardware for its real-time implementation are proposed. The proposed MRF ME algorithm reduces the computational complexity of MRF ME by using a dynamically determined number of reference frames for each Macroblock (MB) and early termination. The proposed H.264 MRF ME hardware is implemented in Verilog HDL. The proposed H.264 MRF ME hardware has 29-72% less energy consumption than an H.264 MRF ME hardware using 5 reference frames for all MBs with a negligible PSNR loss. Therefore, it can be used in consumer electronics products that require real-time video processing or compression with low power consumption.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2011.6018897","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/30/6018840/06018897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2011.6018897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6018840","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1383","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low energy adaptive hardware for H.264 multiple reference frame motion estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low energy adaptive hardware for H.264 multiple reference frame motion estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"3","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12228391","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6018897/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low energy adaptive hardware for H.264 multiple reference frame motion estimation","sourcePdf":"p1377-aysu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056938S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"6018840","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6018840","articleId":"6018897","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6018903,"authors":[{"name":"Slawomir Grzonkowski","affiliation":["DERI research institute, National University of Ireland Galway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/6018840/6018903/6018903-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Slawomir Grzonkowski received his MSc in Computer Science from Gdansk University of Technology (Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Informatics), Poland in 2006.

Both algorithms can significantly improve the spectral estimation performance, including enhanced resolution and reduced sidelobe levels. Moreover, we consider fast implementations of these algorithms using the Conjugate Gradient (CG) technique and the Gohberg-Semencul-type (GS) formula. Our proposed implementations fully exploit the structure of the steering matrices and maximize the usage of the fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in much lower computational complexities as well as much reduced memory requirements. The effectiveness of the adaptive spectral estimation algorithms is demonstrated via several numerical examples including both 1-D spectral estimation and 2-D interrupted synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging examples.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Signal processing algorithms","Covariance matrix","Iterative methods","Computational complexity","Data models","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","computational complexity","conjugate gradient methods","estimation theory","fast Fourier transforms","iterative methods","minimisation","nonparametric statistics","radar imaging","signal resolution","signal sampling","sparse matrices","spectral analysis","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonparametric missing sample spectral analysis","interrupted SAR","nonparametric adaptive spectral analysis","complex-valued data sequences","arbitrary patterns","high-resolution missing-data spectral estimation algorithms","iterative adaptive approach","IAA","sparse learning via iterative minimization method","SLIM method","spectral estimation performance","enhanced resolution","reduced sidelobe levels","conjugate gradient technique","CG technique","Gohberg-Semencul-type formula","GS formula","steering matrices","fast Fourier transform","FFT","computational complexity","reduced memory requirements","adaptive spectral estimation algorithms","1D spectral estimation","2D interrupted synthetic aperture radar imaging","SAR imaging"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Interrupted synthetic aperture radar (SAR)","iterative adaptive approach (IAA)","missing data","sparse learning via iterative minimization (SLIM)","spectral analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2168192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/6130608/06018984.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6130608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2011.2168192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonparametric Missing Sample Spectral Analysis and Its Applications to Interrupted SAR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonparametric Missing Sample Spectral Analysis and Its Applications to Interrupted SAR","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018984/","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6018984/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12471852","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonparametric Missing Sample Spectral Analysis and Its Applications to Interrupted SAR","sourcePdf":"jstsp-li-2168192-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087173S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"6130608","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"6130608","articleId":"6018984","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6018992,"authors":[{"name":"Vito Cerone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Vito","lastName":"Cerone","id":"37297911500"},{"name":"Dario Piga","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Dario","lastName":"Piga","id":"37398458800"},{"name":"Diego Regruto","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Regruto","id":"37297912500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"6018992","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":699},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"abstract":"In this technical note, the set membership error-in-variables identification problem is considered, that is the identification of linear dynamic systems when both output and input measurements are corrupted by bounded noise. A new approach for the computation of parameter uncertainty intervals is presented. First, the identification problem is formulated in terms of nonconvex optimization. Then, relaxation techniques based on linear matrix inequalities are employed to evaluate parameter bounds by means of convex optimization. The inherent structured sparsity of the original identification problems is exploited to reduce the computational complexity of the relaxed problems. Finally, convergence properties and complexity of the proposed procedure are discussed. Advantages of the presented technique with respect to previously published results are discussed and shown by means of two simulated examples.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Noise","Strontium","Polynomials","Uncertainty","Uncertain systems","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","concave programming","identification","linear matrix inequalities","linear systems","set theory","uncertain systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["set-membership error-in-variables identification","convex relaxation techniques","linear dynamic systems","input measurements","output measurements","parameter uncertainty intervals","nonconvex optimization","linear matrix inequalities","computational com\u00ac plexity","convergence properties"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Errors-in-variables (EIV)","linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxation","set-membership identification","sparse polynomial optimization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2168073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6139300/06018992.pdf","startPage":"517","endPage":"522","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6139300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2168073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Set-Membership Error-in-Variables Identification Through Convex Relaxation Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6018992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Set-Membership Error-in-Variables Identification Through Convex Relaxation Techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6018992/","volume":"57","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6018992/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12490234","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Set-Membership Error-in-Variables Identification Through Convex Relaxation Techniques","sourcePdf":"tac-cerone-2168073-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065256S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6139300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6139300","articleId":"6018992","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6018998,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Jian Cheng","affiliation":["EHF Key Laboratory of Fundamental Science, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6119107/6018998/6018998-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yu Jian Cheng (S'08\u2013M'11) was born in Sichuan Province, China, on April, 1983.

This paper focuses on the design of such a reflectarray, which can be used as a high gain, reconfigurable transmitting antenna for communication links. The reflectarray element is an aperture-coupled microstrip patch that accepts a linearly polarized wave, phase shifts and amplifies the guided-waves in the transmission lines, and then re-radiates an orthogonally-polarized wave. First, the element design, modelling, stability analysis and experimental results are presented. Then a 48 element reflectarray prototype operating at 5.7 GHz is described and its two dimensional beam steering capability and amplifying nature are successfully demonstrated and verified.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","accessionNumber":"12438153","htmlLink":"/document/6019001/","displayDocTitle":"An Amplifying Reconfigurable Reflectarray Antenna","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Amplifying Reconfigurable Reflectarray Antenna","sourcePdf":"tap-hum-2167939-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108431S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6119107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6119107","articleId":"6019001","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6019002,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Li","id":"37405713200"},{"name":"Zhijun Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhijun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279625900"},{"name":"Jianfeng Zheng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37534884900"},{"name":"Zhenghe Feng","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications, Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhenghe","lastName":"Feng","id":"37278814400"},{"name":"Magdy F.

Numerical accuracy of the full wave three-dimensional (3D) ADI implementation is validated by comparison with spherical FDTD results. While not free from late time instability, transient responses are shown to be obtained accurately for time steps as large as 15 times the time step derived from cells at the Equator.

In this approach, the reduced order system matrices are represented in terms of their orthogonal polynomial chaos expansions on the probability space defined by the input random variables. The coefficients of these polynomials, which are matrices, are obtained through the repeated, deterministic model order reduction of finite element models generated for specific values of the input random parameters. These values are chosen efficiently in a multi-dimensional grid using a Smolyak algorithm. The generated stochastic reduced order model is represented in the form of an augmented system that lends itself to the direct generation of the desired statistics of the device response. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through its application to the reduced-order finite element modeling of a terminated coaxial cable and a circular wire loop antenna.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/6119107/06019014.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"309","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2011.2167935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2011.2167935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6119107","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6019014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-Order Models of Finite Element Approximations of Electromagnetic Devices Exhibiting Statistical Variability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Stochastic processes","Chaos","Reduced order systems","Mathematical model","Approximation methods","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic devices","finite element analysis","reduced order systems","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced-order model","finite element approximation","electromagnetic devices","statistical variability","reduced order system matrices","orthogonal polynomial chaos expansions","probability space","deterministic model order reduction","finite element model","multidimensional grid","Smolyak algorithm","stochastic reduced order model","augmented system","terminated coaxial cable","circular wire loop antenna"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Finite element","Krylov methods","Model order reduction","polynomial chaos","random input","stochastic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019014/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-Order Models of Finite Element Approximations of Electromagnetic Devices Exhibiting Statistical Variability","volume":"60","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6019014/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","accessionNumber":"12438163","dateOfInsertion":"03 January 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-Order Models of Finite Element Approximations of Electromagnetic Devices Exhibiting Statistical Variability","sourcePdf":"tap-sumant-2167935-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067565S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"6119107","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"6119107","articleId":"6019014","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6019017,"authors":[{"name":"Yizhen Tong","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/6119107/6019017/6019017-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yizhen Tong was born in Wuhan, China.

However, the adverse impact on the electrical performance of the TSV due to the sidewall scallops or wavy profile due to the cyclical nature of the Bosch process has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper therefore focuses on the impact of sidewall scallops on the inter-via electrical leakage performance. Based on finite element analysis, this paper describes that the high stress concentration on the dielectric and barrier layers at the sharp scallops can potentially contribute to barrier failure. It is demonstrated that by smoothening the sidewalls of the TSV, the thermo-mechanical stresses on the dielectric and tantalum barrier is significantly reduced. A test vehicle is designed and fabricated with different geometry of deep silicon vias to study the impact of sidewall profile smoothening for different copper diffusion barrier stacks. It is experimentally demonstrated that the inter-via electrical leakage current can be reduced by almost three orders of magnitude when the sidewall roughness is reduced or replaced by a smoother sidewall. It is also indicated that it is sufficient to smoothen the initial few micrometers of the TSV depth by using a non-Bosch etch process. It is concluded that the Bosch etch process can still be used, with all its merits of high etch rate and high etch selectivity, by tailoring a short initial etch step to smoothen the top sidewalls to minimize the adverse effects of the sidewall scallops.","doi":"10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2160395","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging and Manufacturing Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5503870/6041055/06019025.pdf","startPage":"1497","endPage":"1507","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6041055","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCPMT.2011.2160395","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Bosch Etch Process on Electrical Isolation of TSV Structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6019025","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Bosch Etch Process on Electrical Isolation of TSV Structures","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019025/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"10 October 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12288132","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6019025/","volume":"1","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Bosch Etch Process on Electrical Isolation of TSV Structures","sourcePdf":"tcpmt-ranganathan-2160395-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114733S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5503870","isNumber":"6041055","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503870","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"6041055","articleId":"6019025","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":6019027,"authors":[{"name":"Ayden Maralani","affiliation":["Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC), University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6139305/6019027/6019027-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ayden Maralani (S'09\u2013M'10) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Mississippi State University in 2009.","He is currently with the Berkeley Sensor and Actuator Center (BSAC), University of California, Berkeley, as an Assistant Scientist working with Professor Albert P.

However, utilizing the Vertical Channel 4H-SiC JFET (SiC JFET) for analog design exhibits significant design challenges, even at room temperature. The fundamental challenges are low intrinsic gain, the limitation of the Gate to Source Voltage Range (GSVR), and restrictions on utilizing Channel Length (CL) as a design parameter due to fabrication complexity. These challenges must be successfully overcome at room temperature, before moving towards high temperature design. The main objective of this paper is to establish a design base, overcome the challenges, demonstrate the feasibility, and present a novel all SiC JFET based operational amplifier (opamp) that addresses overall performance at room temperature. Before attempting design, Enhancement Mode (EM) and Depletion Mode (DM) SiC JFETs are characterized, analyzed, and modeled for simulation. A unique and reliable four stage opamp configuration is presented that takes design requirements into account, uses threshold voltage (V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sub>\n) in place of CL as a design parameter, and employs gain enhancing design techniques while achieving maximum obtainable frequency response. The final opamp is fabricated and tested and shown to have 66.7 dB DC gain and 5.71 MHz unity gain frequency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6019027/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2012","publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12489711","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Design of an Operational Amplifier Using Silicon Carbide JFETs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Design of an Operational Amplifier Using Silicon Carbide JFETs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-maralani-2162370-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063706S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6139305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6139305","articleId":"6019027","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6019029,"authors":[{"name":"An-Chao Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/6227366/6019029/6019029-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["An-Chao Tsai received the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from Da-Yeh University, Changhua, Taiwan, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2010.","He has been a Senior Engineer with Hon Hai Precision Industry Company, Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan, since 2010.

However, the computation burden of the VBSME becomes the bottleneck of the H.264/AVC encoders. The conventional architecture in hardware realization is hard to adopt a fast software algorithm suitable to reduce the VBSME computation burden. Therefore, this paper presents a search point reduction (SPR) algorithm with an efficient hardware design, able to decrease the motion estimation time while maintaining the coding performance of H.264. The effectiveness of the proposed method is compared with those of existing methods with respect to chip area, operation frequency, and throughput rate. The proposed SPR algorithm increases the coding speed by around 90%; with a peak signal-to-noise ratio drop of less than 0.1 dB than that achieved by the JM reference software. The proposed SPR algorithm can operate at 200 MHz with 191 k gate count, which supports high-definition television 1280\u00a0\u00a0720 format.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2165592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/76/6227366/06019029.pdf","startPage":"981","endPage":"988","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2011.2165592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6227366","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective Search Point Reduction Algorithm and its VLSI Design for HDTV H.264/AVC Variable Block Size Motion Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6019029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019029/","displayDocTitle":"Effective Search Point Reduction Algorithm and its VLSI Design for HDTV H.264/AVC Variable Block Size Motion Estimation","volume":"22","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12820731","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6019029/","dateOfInsertion":"28 June 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective Search Point Reduction Algorithm and its VLSI Design for HDTV H.264/AVC Variable Block Size Motion Estimation","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-tsai-2165592-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1116S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"6227366","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6227366","articleId":"6019029","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":6019037,"authors":[{"name":"Shuai Huang","affiliation":["Faculty of Materials, Optoelectronics, and Physics, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/6022820/6019037/6019037-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shuai Huang was born in Chongqing, China, in 1983.

The proposed controller is compared with the traditional second-order generalized integrator (SOGI)-based current controller. It is confirmed that, in normal operation conditions, both controllers have similar performance, requiring the ROGI-based controller much less computational burden than the SOGI counterpart. The proposed controller injects sinusoidal currents synchronized with the grid voltage, without requiring any dedicated synchronization algorithm. Three different current injection strategies are realizable with the same controller structure: balanced current injection, constant instantaneous active power injection, and maximum instantaneous active power injection. A state-variable-based control methodology in the discrete-time domain is presented. It ensures the stability and performance of the closed-loop system, even for high-order controllers and large digital signal processor processing delay. Moreover, it is confirmed that the proposed controller works satisfactorily even on faulty grid conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019050/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6019050/","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12537478","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Current Controller Based on Reduced Order Generalized Integrators for Distributed Generation Systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Current Controller Based on Reduced Order Generalized Integrators for Distributed Generation Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-leon-2167892-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140444S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6151927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"6151927","articleId":"6019050","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":6019051,"authors":[{"name":"Jos H.

Most described applications are electromagnetic actuators. This report deals with the problem of finding an optimal structure of the permanent magnets used within a surface mounted permanent-magnet synchronous machine. In contrast to other reported methods, which use continuous models to describe the material properties with a postponed homogenization process, this paper will present a possible solution to the structural optimization problem by a simple heuristic search algorithm. For that purpose, the preselected design area is discretized with suitable quadrilateral cells. The material properties of each cell are set by a simple heuristic search algorithm, while the material properties are chosen from a discrete set of material properties. Therefore, the resulting problem is a discrete optimization problem. The finite-element method is used to solve the magnetic field equations and to gain information about the optimization performance index for each material distribution variant occurring during the optimization process.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2011.2167980","startPage":"118","endPage":"127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2011.2167980","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6111552","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/6111552/06019052.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heuristic Structural Optimization of the Permanent Magnets Used in a Surface Mounted Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019052/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Heuristic Structural Optimization of the Permanent Magnets Used in a Surface Mounted Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine","volume":"48","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6019052/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12427039","publicationDate":"Jan. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heuristic Structural Optimization of the Permanent Magnets Used in a Surface Mounted Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Machine","sourcePdf":"tmag-hahn-2167980-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04832S","chronDate":"Jan.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"6111552","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6111552","articleId":"6019052","onlineDate":"15 September 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6019054,"authors":[{"name":"Jean-Nicolas Viant","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Claude Bemard Lyon 1, Villeurbanne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6301724/6019054/6019054-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jean-Nicolas Viant was born in Remiremont, France, in 1984.

The wide area or global signals are taken from network locations where the oscillations are well observable, and the PSS controller uses only those local and remote input signals in which the assigned single inter-area mode is most observable, and it is located at a generator most effective in controlling that mode. The PSS controller works mainly in a frequency band given by the natural frequency of the assigned mode. Pade approximation approach is used to model the time delay and uncertainty with regard to its value. This model is then merged with the delay-free power system model to obtain the overall power system model. Finally, the controllers are redesigned for the delayed-input system considering delay uncertainty. The effectiveness of the resulting PSS controllers in achieving improved damping of inter-area modes is demonstrated through simulation studies conducted on a test power system.","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2011.6019194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2011.6019194","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel5/6006989/6019147/06019194.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective damping of inter area oscillations using phasor measurement unit (PMU) signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Selective damping of inter area oscillations using phasor measurement unit (PMU) signals","conferenceDate":"19-23 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6019194/","accessionNumber":"12243587","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019194/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective damping of inter area oscillations using phasor measurement unit (PMU) signals","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046627S","chronDate":"19-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006989","isNumber":"6019147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006989","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6019147","articleId":"6019194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6019229,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The huge proliferation of wind farms across the world has arisen as an alternative to the traditional power generation and also as a result of economic issues which necessitate monitoring systems in order to optimize availability and profits. Tools to detect the onset of mechanical and electrical faults in wind turbines at a sufficiently early stage are very important for maintenance actions to be well planned, because these actions can reduce the outage time and can prevent bigger faults that may lead to machine stoppage. The set of measurements obtained from the wind turbines are enormous and as such the use of neural networks may be beneficial in understanding if there is any important information that may help the prevention of big failures.","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2011.6019229","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2011.6019229","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel5/6006989/6019147/06019229.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of neural networks for failure detection on wind turbines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Application of neural networks for failure detection on wind turbines","conferenceDate":"19-23 June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6019229/","accessionNumber":"12243622","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019229/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of neural networks for failure detection on wind turbines","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058343S","chronDate":"19-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006989","isNumber":"6019147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006989","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6019147","articleId":"6019229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6019243,"authors":[{"name":"David M.

The IEC 61850 series of standards, released in parts over the last ten years, provide a specification for substation communications networks and systems. These standards, along with IEEE Std 1588-2008 Precision Time Protocol version 2 (PTPv2) for precision timing, are recommended by the both IEC Smart Grid Strategy Group and the NIST Framework and Roadmap for Smart Grid Interoperability Standards for substation automation. IEC 61850-8-1 and IEC 61850-9-2 provide an inter-operable solution to support multi-vendor digital process bus solutions, allowing for the removal of potentially lethal voltages and damaging currents from substation control rooms, a reduction in the amount of cabling required in substations, and facilitates the adoption of non-conventional instrument transformers (NCITs). IEC 61850, PTPv2 and Ethernet are three complementary protocol families that together define the future of sampled value digital process connections for smart substation automation. This paper describes a specific test and evaluation system that uses real time simulation, protection relays, PTPv2 time clocks and artificial network impairment that is being used to investigate technical impediments to the adoption of SV process bus systems by transmission utilities. Knowing the limits of a digital process bus, especially when sampled values and NCITs are included, will enable utilities to make informed decisions regarding the adoption of this technology.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEC standards","Clocks","Substations","Synchronization","Smart grids","Instrument transformers","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["open systems","smart power grids","substation automation","substation protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprotocol sampled value protection scheme test system","multiprotocol sampled value protection scheme evaluation system","transmission smart grid","digital platform","substation automation","IEC 61850 series","substation communication network","IEEE Std 1588-2008 precision time protocol version 2","precision timing","IEC smart grid strategy group","NIST framework","smart grid interoperability standard","multivendor digital process bus solution","lethal voltage","substation control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ethernet networks","IEC 61850","IEEE 1588","performance evaluation","power system simulation","power transmission","protective relaying","smart grids","time measurement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PTC.2011.6019243","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel5/6006989/6019147/06019243.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019147","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2011.6019243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Test and evaluation system for multi-protocol sampled value protection schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6019243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Test and evaluation system for multi-protocol sampled value protection schemes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019243/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6019243/","accessionNumber":"12243636","conferenceDate":"19-23 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Test and evaluation system for multi-protocol sampled value protection schemes","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"270.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053628S","chronDate":"19-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006989","isNumber":"6019147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006989","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6019147","articleId":"6019243","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6019279,"authors":[{"name":"Ryota Aihara","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, The University of Tokyo, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6006989/6019147/6019279/6019279-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ryota Aihara was born in Tokyo, Japan, on September 20, 1984.

However, the power output from the PV is random and intermittent in nature. Therefore, the PV generation poses many challenges to system operation. To evaluate impacts of the behavior of PV on power supply reliability, we have developed power supply reliability evaluation model considering a large integration of PV generation into power system. As a result, the power supply reliability is getting worse as the PV penetration increases. To mitigate this issue, we have proposed that pumped storage hydro power plant (PSHPP) is used to improve the reliability. However, its operation may increase the power system operational cost. In this paper a new method for scheduling the effective operating pattern for PSHPP that makes it possible to improve both reliability and economy is presented.","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2011.6019279","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2011.6019279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019147","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel5/6006989/6019147/06019279.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal operation scheduling of pumped storage hydro power plant in power system with a large penetration of photovoltaic generation using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019279/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal operation scheduling of pumped storage hydro power plant in power system with a large penetration of photovoltaic generation using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6019279/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12243672","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","conferenceDate":"19-23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal operation scheduling of pumped storage hydro power plant in power system with a large penetration of photovoltaic generation using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"331.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053999S","chronDate":"19-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006989","isNumber":"6019147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006989","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6019147","articleId":"6019279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6019295,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The model consider both the reliability of a SCADA system and the reliability of a communication system during a power outage. If a remote control of CB fails, due to battery undersizing, it is assumed in the paper that a manual operation of CB can be performed if field personal can communicate with the TSO head-quarter. The evaluation of the reliability to operate CB is performed by solving the so called s-t reliability problem for a graph with failure prone components. The method is applied in a case study where the SCADA architecture for an IEEE reliability test system is modeled.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019295/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12243688","htmlLink":"/document/6019295/","conferenceDate":"19-23 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A circuit breaker reliability model for restoration planning considering risk of communication outage","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A circuit breaker reliability model for restoration planning considering risk of communication outage","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078802S","chronDate":"19-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006989","isNumber":"6019147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006989","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6019147","articleId":"6019295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6019310,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The proposed algorithm performs the estimation for both amplitude and phase of each injection harmonic currents by minimizing the error between the measured values from Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) and the values computed from the estimated parameters during the estimation process. The proposed algorithm can take into account the uncertainty of the harmonic pseudo measurement and the tolerance in the line impedances of the network as well as the uncertainty of the Distributed Generators (DGs) such as Wind Turbines (WTs). The main features of the proposed MPSO algorithm are usage of a primary and secondary PSO loop and applying the mutation function. The simulation results on 34-bus IEEE radial and a 70-bus realistic radial test networks are presented. The results demonstrate that the speed and the accuracy of the proposed Distribution Harmonic State Estimation (DHSE) algorithm are very excellent compared to the algorithms such as Weight Least Square (WLS), Genetic Algorithm (GA), original PSO, and Honey Bees Mating Optimization (HBMO).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019326/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12243719","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6019326/","publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","conferenceDate":"19-23 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distribution harmonic state estimation based on a modified PSO considering parameters uncertainty","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution harmonic state estimation based on a modified PSO considering parameters uncertainty","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079669S","chronDate":"19-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006989","isNumber":"6019147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006989","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6019147","articleId":"6019326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6019385,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The available VSC MTDC models are often based on the extension of existing point-to-point connections and use a single DC slack bus that adapts its active power injection to control the DC voltage. A distributed DC voltage control has significant advantages over its concentrated slack bus counterpart, since a numbers of converters can jointly control the DC system voltage. After a fault, a voltage droop controlled DC grid converges to a new working point, which impacts the power flows in both the DC grid and the underlying AC grids. Whereas current day research is focussing on the dynamic behaviour of such a system, this paper introduces a power flow model to study the steady-state change of the combined AC/DC system as a result of faults and transients in the DC grid. The model allows to incorporate DC grids in a N-1 contingency analysis, thereby including the effects of a distributed voltage control on the power flows in both the AC and DC systems.","doi":"10.1109/PTC.2011.6019434","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE Trondheim PowerTech","pdfPath":"/iel5/6006989/6019147/06019434.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PTC.2011.6019434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VSC MTDC systems with a distributed DC voltage control - A power flow approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6019434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019434/","displayDocTitle":"VSC MTDC systems with a distributed DC voltage control - A power flow approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12243827","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6019434/","conferenceDate":"19-23 June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VSC MTDC systems with a distributed DC voltage control - A power flow approach","confLoc":"Trondheim, Norway","sourcePdf":"607.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055456S","chronDate":"19-23 June 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6006989","isNumber":"6019147","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6006989","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"6019147","articleId":"6019434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6019475,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Shaochuan","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Shaochuan","id":"37088130741"},{"name":"YuanweiJing","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"YuanweiJing","id":"37088130320"},{"name":"Xuebo Chen","affiliation":["Technology Institute of Electronic and Information Engineering Liaoning University, Anshan, China"],"firstName":"Xuebo","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278213400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-181-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-180-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-179-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6019475","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6019475","abstract":"For multi-area interconnected system with overlapping structure, the decentralized controller is designed, and the optimization controller is used to ensure the quality of power frequency and exchanging power of tie lines for power system.

Artificial neural network is a promising area in the development of intelligent sensors. In this paper, we present a model of gap sensor based on fuzzy neural network. The proposed model based fuzzy network scheme incorporates intelligence into the sensor. The fuzzy neural network, as an inverse model compensator if connected in series to the output terminal of the gap sensor, would estimate the correct true gap in a range of temperature after proper training. We trained the network by gradient descent learning algorithm with momentum. It is revealed from the simulation studies that this gap sensor model can provide correct gap within the error less than \u00b10.4mm over a range of temperature variations from 20 \u00b0C to 80\u00b0C and within \u00b10.2mm only considering the work gap 8mm to 12mm.

The classical recognition method based on feature extraction usually compares feature data of unrecognized radar signal with the data in database and then obtains emitter recognition result. For the system of radar becoming more and more complex nowadays, traditional methods of radar emitter recognition are facing more and more flinty problems. A new feature description method called pulse sample figure is put forward in this paper to describe complex system radars more exactly. Then the corresponding algorithm of radar emitter recognition based on pulse sample figure is researched. In this algorithm, complete sorting and feature extraction in traditional emitter recognition are unnecessary, so the processing step is simplified. Simulation results show that the algorithm is available and practical; especially a high correct recognition rate can be got when the density of pulse sequence data is moderate with this algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar","Noise","Feature extraction","Radio frequency","Noise measurement","Measurement uncertainty","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","large-scale systems","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar emitter recognition method","pulse sample figure","radar signal processing","feature extraction","feature description method","complex system radar","pulse sequence data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["emitter recognition","feature extraction","feature description","pulse sample figure","template matching"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019818","publicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012258/6019524/06019818.pdf","startPage":"1902","endPage":"1905","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new radar emitter recognition method based on pulse sample figure","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6019818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new radar emitter recognition method based on pulse sample figure","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019818/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6019818/","accessionNumber":"12244227","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new radar emitter recognition method based on pulse sample figure","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"1520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040345S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012258","isNumber":"6019524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012258","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6019524","articleId":"6019818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6019822,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Li","affiliation":["Department of Electromechanical Engineering, Shijiazhuang Institute of Railway Technology, Shijiazhuang, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Li","id":"37293382000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-181-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-180-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-179-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6019822","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":259},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Continuous wavelet transforms","Vibrations","Wavelet analysis","Feature extraction","Rolling bearings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","fault diagnosis","machine bearings","mechanical engineering computing","vibrations","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bearing localized fault diagnosis","time scale spectrum","continuous Morlet wavelet transform technique","time scale joint representation plane","mechanical system","singularity detection","vibration signals","bearing fault detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Bearing","Continuous wavelet transform","Morlet wavelet","Signal processing"]}],"abstract":"A new approach to bearing localized fault diagnosis based on time scale spectrum of continuous Morlet wavelet transform technique is presented.

Several clustering algorithms have been introduced for data streams based on distance which are incompetent to find clusters of arbitrary shapes and cannot handle the outliers. Density-based clustering algorithms are remarkable not only to find arbitrarily shaped clusters but also to deal with noise in data. In density-based clustering algorithms, dense areas of objects in the data space are considered as clusters which are segregated by low-density area. Another group of the clustering methods for data streams is grid-based clustering where the data space is quantized into finite number of cells which form the grid structure and perform clustering on the grids. Grid-based clustering maps the infinite number of data records in data streams to finite numbers of grids. In this paper we review the grid based clustering algorithms that use density-based algorithms or density concept for the clustering. We called them density-grid clustering algorithms. We explore the algorithms in details and the merits and limitations of them. The algorithms are also summarized in a table based on the important features. Besides that, we discuss about how well the algorithms address the challenging issues in the clustering data streams.","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019867","startPage":"1652","publicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012258/6019524/06019867.pdf","endPage":"1656","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019524","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019867/","displayDocTitle":"A study of density-grid based clustering algorithms on data streams","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/6019867/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12244276","publicationDate":"July 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of density-grid based clustering algorithms on data streams","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072177S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012258","isNumber":"6019524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012258","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"6019524","articleId":"6019867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6019914,"authors":[{"name":"Jui-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism, Tungs' Taichung MetroHarbor Hospital Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Jui-Ming","lastName":"Chen"},{"name":"Meng-Hsiun Tsai","affiliation":["Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Meng-Hsiun","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37593964900"},{"name":"Shih-Huei Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Genomics and Bioinformatics, National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Shih-Huei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37086712233"},{"name":"Sheng-Hsiung Chiu","affiliation":["Troilus Biotechnology Co.

In this essay, we utilize the microarray data from the carcinoma cancer as primary sample. And we apply statistical methods and mathematical calculations to establish a diseases analyzing model. At first, we use principal component analysis to process the pre-selected data. Then we use ANOVA to select the genes with significant expression differences to be our target genes. Finally we use supervised learning method to evaluate the accuracy of classification. This analytical model helps to reduce the number of incorrect attempts and cut down the time which has to be spent in experiments. This model can analyze complicated cancer expression data, and it can also be useful in researches for other diseases.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The study of ovarian carcinoma gene regulatory mechanism based on the shortest path algorithm and conditional probabilities","publicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","doi":"10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019914","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 Eighth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems and Knowledge Discovery (FSKD)","pdfPath":"/iel5/6012258/6019524/06019914.pdf","startPage":"1638","endPage":"1642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FSKD.2011.6019914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6019524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6019914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6019914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 July 2011","displayDocTitle":"The study of ovarian carcinoma gene regulatory mechanism based on the shortest path algorithm and conditional probabilities","conferenceDate":"26-28 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6019914/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12244323","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The study of ovarian carcinoma gene regulatory mechanism based on the shortest path algorithm and conditional probabilities","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"2774.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086431S","chronDate":"26-28 July 2011","xplore-pub-id":"6012258","isNumber":"6019524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6012258","xplore-issue":"6019524","articleId":"6019914","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6019945,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Yue","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Central Missouri, Warrensburg, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaodong","lastName":"Yue","id":"37284756800"},{"name":"Xuefu Zhou","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computing Systems, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Xuefu","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37559474800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-181-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-180-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-179-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6019945","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":173},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Noise","Channel estimation","Niobium","Blind equalizers","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","OFDM modulation","Toeplitz matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind channel estimation","CP-free OFDM communications systems","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing systems","cyclic prefix systems","time-dispersive channel","block Toeplitz structure","channel matrix","equivalent received vectors","received OFDM data blocks","wideband communication scenarios","computer simulations","subspace-based methods"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a subspace method is proposed for blind channel estimation in orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems over time-dispersive channel.

As a result, the proposed algorithm is able to identify the channels using very few received OFDM data blocks which makes it possible candidate for wideband communication scenarios where the channel is time-invariant for only a few OFDM symbols.
