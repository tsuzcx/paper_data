The hybrid dc circuit breaker prototype can interrupt a circuit in less than 2 ms in dc power systems up to 10 kV, such as in electric ships. The ultrafast operations and extremely low loss can effectively limit the fault current level and switching transients in all medium-voltage systems, and can provide intelligent and fast protection function for smart power distribution and critical loads in a modernized grid. The design considerations of the three switching devices of the hybrid dc circuit breaker are presented.

The BSs compress the received signals with Wyner-Ziv coding and send the representation bits to the CP; the CP performs the decoding of all the users' messages. Under this setup, this paper makes progress toward the optimal structure of the fronthaul compression and CP decoding strategies for the compress-and-forward scheme in the C-RAN. On the CP decoding strategy design, this paper shows that under a sum fronthaul capacity constraint, a generalized successive decoding strategy of the quantization and user message codewords that allows arbitrary interleaved order at the CP achieves the same rate region as the optimal joint decoding. Furthermore, it is shown that a practical strategy of successively decoding the quantization codewords first, then the user messages, achieves the same maximum sum rate as joint decoding under individual fronthaul constraints. On the joint optimization of user transmission and BS quantization strategies, this paper shows that if the input distributions are assumed to be Gaussian, then under joint decoding, the optimal quantization scheme for maximizing the achievable rate region is Gaussian. Moreover, Gaussian input and Gaussian quantization with joint decoding achieve to within a constant gap of the capacity region of the Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) uplink C-RAN model. Finally, this paper addresses the computational aspect of optimizing uplink MIMO C-RAN by showing that under fixed Gaussian input, the sum rate maximization problem over the Gaussian quantization noise covariance matrices can be formulated as convex optimization problems, thereby facilitating its efficient solution.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2016.2617862","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7748579/07590010.pdf","startPage":"7402","endPage":"7418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7748579","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2617862","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Optimal Fronthaul Compression and Decoding Strategies for Uplink Cloud Radio Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"On the Optimal Fronthaul Compression and Decoding Strategies for Uplink Cloud Radio Access Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590010/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16465917","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590010/","volume":"62","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"University Grants Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"AoE/E- 02/08"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401086"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Optimal Fronthaul Compression and Decoding Strategies for Uplink Cloud Radio Access Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-zhou-2617862-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.172121S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7748579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7748579","articleId":"7590010","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7590013,"authors":[{"name":"Haobin Shi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8246762/7590013/shi-2617464-small.gif","p":["Haobin Shi is received the Ph.D. degree from Northwestern\n Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China, in 2008.","He is an Associate Professor in the School of Computer Science at the Northwestern Polytechnical University, and a\n Visiting Scholar in the Electrical Engineering Department, National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Problems of complex modeling and instability always exist in visual servoing methods. Moreover, there are few research works on selection of the servoing gain in image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods. This paper proposes an IBVS method with Q-Learning, where the learning rate is adjusted by a fuzzy system. Meanwhile, a synthetic preprocess is introduced to perform feature extraction. The extraction method is actually a combination of a color-based recognition algorithm and an improved contour-based recognition algorithm. For dealing with underactuated dynamics of the unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), a decoupled controller is designed, where the velocity and attitude are decoupled through attenuating the effects of underactuation in roll and pitch and two independent servoing gains, for linear and angular motion servoing, respectively, are designed in place of single servoing gain in traditional methods. For further improvement in convergence and stability, a reinforcement learning method, Q-Learning, is taken for adaptive servoing gain adjustment. The Q-Learning is composed of two independent learning agents for adjusting two serving gains, respectively. In order to improve the performance of the Q-Learning, a fuzzy-based method is proposed for tuning the learning rate. The results of simulations and experiments on control of UAVs demonstrate that the proposed method has better properties in stability and convergence than the competing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2016.2617464","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8246762/07590013.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"252","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2016.2617464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8246762","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decoupled Visual Servoing With Fuzzy <i>Q</i>-Learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Decoupled Visual Servoing With Fuzzy <i>Q</i>-Learning","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17485868","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7590013/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61373120"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi","grantNumber":"2015JM6308"},{"fundingName":"Fund of national ministries","grantNumber":"9140A15090115HK03216"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"3102015JSJ0005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decoupled Visual Servoing With Fuzzy <italic>Q</italic>-Learning","sourcePdf":"tii-hwang-2617464-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084685S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8246762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"8246762","articleId":"7590013","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7590017,"authors":[{"name":"Guixian Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Fujian, China","School of Physics and Electronic Science, Guizhou Normal University, Guiyang, China"],"firstName":"Guixian","lastName":"Cheng","orcid":"0000-0001-7391-7256","id":"37086116356"},{"name":"Lin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-6698-129X","id":"37280765200"},{"name":"Weikai Xu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Xiamen University, Fujian, China"],"firstName":"Weikai","lastName":"Xu","orcid":"0000-0001-7172-1807","id":"37291469800"},{"name":"Guanrong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Guanrong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085348099"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7590017","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":763},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590017","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Indexes","Modulation","Chaotic communication","Detectors","Fading channels","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","chaotic communication","demodulation","error statistics","modulation","multipath channels","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier index differential chaos shift keying modulation","DCSK modulation method","IM","multicarrier DCSK","MC-DCSK","index selectors","index detectors","one-to-one mappings","carrier activation patterns","analytical bit error rate expression","additive white Gaussian noise","multipath Rayleigh fading channels","energy efficiency","spectral efficiency","demodulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Detection","differential chaos shift keying (DCSK)","energy efficiency","index modulation (IM)","multicarriers","spectrum efficiency"]}],"abstract":"A new carrier index differential chaos shift keying (DCSK) modulation method combining index modulation (IM) with multicarrier DCSK (MC-DCSK) is proposed.

The processing chain of medical data mainly includes data collection, data storage and data sharing, etc. Traditional healthcare system often requires the delivery of medical data to the cloud, which involves users' sensitive information and causes communication energy consumption. Practically, medical data sharing is a critical and challenging issue. Thus in this paper, we build up a novel healthcare system by utilizing the flexibility of cloudlet. The functions of cloudlet include privacy protection, data sharing and intrusion detection. In the stage of data collection, we first utilize Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU) method to encrypt user's body data collected by wearable devices. Those data will be transmitted to nearby cloudlet in an energy efficient fashion. Second, we present a new trust model to help users to select trustable partners who want to share stored data in the cloudlet. The trust model also helps similar patients to communicate with each other about their diseases. Third, we divide users' medical data stored in remote cloud of hospital into three parts, and give them proper protection. Finally, in order to protect the healthcare system from malicious attacks, we develop a novel collaborative intrusion detection system (IDS) method based on cloudlet mesh, which can effectively prevent the remote healthcare big data cloud from attacks.

The circuit employs a modified hill-climbing algorithm based on a 3-points comparison instead of the traditional 2-points comparison.

Moreover, to achieve high MPP tracking efficiency, a low-power linear analog multiplier is implemented to accurately compute the instantaneous power of the PV source from its sensed voltage and current levels. This power-metering function is realized in the analog domain to eliminate the need for data converters and to minimize the MPPT circuit's power consumption.

However, this is often insufficient in various real-world applications, as the emotions that are evoked in viewers by an image are highly subjective and different. In this paper, we propose to predict the continuous probability distribution of image emotions which are represented in dimensional valence-arousal space. We carried out large-scale statistical analysis on the constructed Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset, on which we observed that the emotion distribution can be well-modeled by a Gaussian mixture model. This model is estimated by an expectation-maximization algorithm with specified initializations. Then, we extract commonly used emotion features at different levels for each image. Finally, we formalize the emotion distribution prediction task as a shared sparse regression (SSR) problem and extend it to multitask settings, named multitask shared sparse regression (MTSSR), to explore the latent information between different prediction tasks. SSR and MTSSR are optimized by iteratively reweighted least squares. Experiments are conducted on the Image-Emotion-Social-Net dataset with comparisons to three alternative baselines. The quantitative results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590031/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"19","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16669318","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7590031/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Probability Distribution Prediction of Image Emotions via Multitask Shared Sparse Regression","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571269, 61271394, 61472103, 61133003, 61671267, 61422210 and 61373076"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Probability Distribution Prediction of Image Emotions via Multitask Shared Sparse Regression","sourcePdf":"tmm-zhao-2617741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167225S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7855855","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"7855855","articleId":"7590031","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7590032,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuo Wang","affiliation":["School of Instrumentation Science and Opto-electronics Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7895231/7590032/wang-2617830-small.gif","p":["Zhuo Wang (M\u201915) was born in Handan, China, in 1983.

In addition, based on Lagrange's mean value theorem, we also give an online linearization technique which is applicable to nonlinear discrete-time systems, whose dynamic models have continuous partial derivatives with respect to the input and the output.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2617830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2617830","startPage":"4121","endPage":"4129","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7895231/07590032.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7895231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Indirect Data-Driven Method for Trajectory Tracking Control of a Class of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","displayDocTitle":"An Indirect Data-Driven Method for Trajectory Tracking Control of a Class of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems","publicationDate":"May 2017","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2017","volume":"64","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590032/","accessionNumber":"16808767","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590032/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673041"},{"fundingName":"Recruitment Program for Young Professionals","grantNumber":"29816172"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Indirect Data-Driven Method for Trajectory Tracking Control of a Class of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems","sourcePdf":"tie-wang-2617830-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111797S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7895231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7895231","articleId":"7590032","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7590035,"authors":[{"name":"Youngwook Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, California State University, Fresno, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7590035/kim-2617282-small.gif","p":["Youngwook Kim (S\u201903\u2013M\u201908\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, South Korea, in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from The University of Texas at Austin, USA, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.

The ten gestures, which included swiping from left to right, swiping from right to left, rotating clockwise, rotating counterclockwise, pushing, double pushing, holding, and double holding, were measured using Doppler radar and their spectrograms investigated. A DCNN was employed to classify the spectrograms, with 90% of the data utilized for training and the remaining 10% for validation.

To solve this problem, we first characterize the optimal power allocation when a D2D link operates in the direct or relay mode. Then, using these power allocation results, the joint mode selection and RG assignment can be formulated as a job assignment problem whose optimal solution can be obtained in polynomial time.

This paper proposed an architecture for double precision floating point division. This architecture is designed for dual-mode functionality, which can either compute on a pair of double precision operands or on two pairs of single precision operands in parallel. The architecture is based on the series expansion multiplicative methodology of mantissa computation. For this, a novel dual-mode Radix-4 Modified Booth multiplier is designed, which is used iteratively in the architecture of dual-mode mantissa computation. Other key components of floating point division flow (such as leading-one-detection, left/right dynamic shifters, rounding, etc.) are also re-designed for the dual-mode operation. The proposed dual-mode architecture is synthesized using UMC \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">90 nm</i>\n technology ASIC implementation. Two versions of proposed architecture are presented, one with single stage multiplier and another with two stage multiplier.

The constructions assume symmetries in the structure of the parity-check matrix and employ a greedy exhaustive search algorithm to find the permutation shifts of the CPMs. As a result of symmetries, the new codes have a more compact representation compared with their counterparts. In majority of cases, also, they achieve the girth 8 at a shorter block length for the same degree distribution (code rate). Deterministic (explicit) constructions are also presented to expand the proposed parity-check matrices to larger block lengths and higher rates. The proposed long high-rate codes are often substantially shorter than regular girth-8 QC-LDPC codes of similar rate in the literature.

This has attracted much attention, since the selected bands provide discriminative information for further applications and reduce the computational burden. Though hyperspectral band selection has gained rapid development in recent years, it is still a challenging task because of the following requirements: 1) an effective model can capture the underlying relations between different high-dimensional spectral bands; 2) a fast and robust measure function can adapt to general hyperspectral tasks; and 3) an efficient search strategy can find the desired selected bands in reasonable computational time. To satisfy these requirements, a multigraph determinantal point process (MDPP) model is proposed to capture the full structure between different bands and efficiently find the optimal band subset in extensive hyperspectral applications. There are three main contributions: 1) graphical model is naturally transferred to address band selection problem by the proposed MDPP; 2) multiple graphs are designed to capture the intrinsic relationships between hyperspectral bands; and 3) mixture DPP is proposed to model the multiple dependencies in the proposed multiple graphs, and offers an efficient search strategy to select the optimal bands. To verify the superiority of the proposed method, experiments have been conducted on three hyperspectral applications, such as hyperspectral classification, anomaly detection, and target detection. The reliability of the proposed method in generic hyperspectral tasks is experimentally proved on four real-world hyperspectral data sets.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2016.2617462","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7743013/07590041.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"64","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2016.2617462","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7743013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discovering Diverse Subset for Unsupervised Hyperspectral Band Selection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590041/","displayDocTitle":"Discovering Diverse Subset for Unsupervised Hyperspectral Band Selection","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16465660","pubMedId":"28113180","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590041/","dateOfInsertion":"14 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (Youth 973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB336500"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"State Key Program of National Natural Science of China","grantNumber":"61232010"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472413"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Key Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"KGZD-EWT03"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the Key Laboratory of Spectral Imaging Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"LSIT201408"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Young Top-Notch Talent Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"QYZDB-SSW-JSC015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discovering Diverse Subset for Unsupervised Hyperspectral Band Selection","sourcePdf":"tip-lu-2617462-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.146073S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7743013","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"7743013","articleId":"7590041","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7590055,"authors":[{"name":"Ning Li","affiliation":["Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7762241/7590055/li-2608423-small.gif","p":["\n\nNing Li (S'15\u2013M'16) received the B.S. degree in \nelectronics information engineering from Northeast Forestry University, Harbin, China, in 2009, the M.S. degree in \ncommunication and information system from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2012, \nand the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IECAS), Beijing, China, in 2015.\n","Since July 2015, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Department of Space Microwave Remote Sensing System, \nIECAS.

Limited by the cost or payloads, light-small aircraft sometimes cannot carry high-accuracy inertial navigation systems (INS)/global positioning systems (GPS). For the very high resolution (VHR) case, residual range cell migration (RCM) often exceeds several range resolution cells during the course of the synthetic aperture, thus degrading the image quality substantially. In this paper, a robust scheme for the correction of residual RCM is presented. The scheme consists of three principle steps. First, the range-compressed data in the signal domain are divided into subapertures in azimuth. For each subaperture, a sliding window is used to select the subblock data with the highest signal-to-clutter ratio. Second, for each subaperture, residual RCM is estimated by using the selected subblock data based on a nonparametric entropy minimization technique. Third, the estimated residual RCM of all subapertures are filtered and coherently combined to perform the correction for the full-aperture data. Processing the results of VHR SAR raw data shows that the proposed scheme is effective for highly precise imaging with light-small aircraft equipped with only low-accuracy INS/GPS.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2608423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7762241/07590055.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"452","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2608423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autofocus Correction of Residual RCM for VHR SAR Sensors With Light-Small Aircraft","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590055/","displayDocTitle":"Autofocus Correction of Residual RCM for VHR SAR Sensors With Light-Small Aircraft","volume":"55","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16499403","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590055/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422113 and 61601437"},{"fundingName":"The Chinese National Ten Thousand Talent Program-Young Top-Notch Talent Program"},{"fundingName":"Hundred Talents Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autofocus Correction of Residual RCM for VHR SAR Sensors With Light-Small Aircraft","sourcePdf":"tgrs-wang-2608423-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102435S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7762241","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7762241","articleId":"7590055","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7590061,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Gamliel","affiliation":["Ring Laboratories Gainesville, FL, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Florida, Gainesville, FA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7803621/7590061/gamli-2617373-small.gif","p":["Eric Gamliel (S\u201914) was born in Los Angeles, CA, USA.

This new approach is then generalized to handle systems with complex dispersion of arbitrarily high-order. It is shown how this results in the second-order accurate algorithms with numerical dispersion relations that can always be cast in the form of continuum dispersion counterparts via simple substitutions, avoiding laborious analysis. This allowed here the first reporting of a numerical Appleton-Hartree equation. The problem of field collocation is handled by the repetition of the Yee algorithm so that all field variables are defined at the corners of a new cubic computational cell. This cell offers new properties, such as full-vector control of the solution at each node. A new technique for deriving the stability condition is introduced to FDTD and shows that the new method has retained the same stability criterion of free-space propagation. Several simulation results are presented, one of which reveals a previously unreported problem, common to some gyrotropic methods-the tendency for spurious fields to arise at source locations. It is shown how this spuriousness, which has contaminated the results of a previous report, may be removed.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2617373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7803621/07590061.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2617373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7803621","startPage":"295","endPage":"308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct Integration 3-D FDTD Method for Single-Species Cold Magnetized Plasma","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Direct Integration 3-D FDTD Method for Single-Species Cold Magnetized Plasma","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16581730","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7590061/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct Integration 3-D FDTD Method for Single-Species Cold Magnetized Plasma","sourcePdf":"tap-gamliel-2617373-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101033S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7803621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7803621","articleId":"7590061","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7590062,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxing He","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7776993/7590062/he-2614666-small.gif","p":["Yuxing He (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2008, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering.","His current research interests include microwave and RF passive components design, especially on the synthesis and design of planar/nonplanar filters and RF system integration."]},"firstName":"Yuxing","lastName":"He","id":"37085405190"},{"name":"Gang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and Information Science, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China","Key Laboratory of Electromagnetic Space Information, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hefei, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7776993/7590062/wang-2614666-small.gif","p":["Gang Wang (M\u201998) was born in Xinjiang, China, in 1967.

With respect to previous works, this technique exhibits distinct benefits due to its simplicity as all the coupling elements, of both cross-coupled and extracted-pole structures, can be obtained as an entity at one time. As the basis, a unique process is introduced to rebuild the couplings and admittance functions for an Nth-order cross-coupled low-pass prototype, from which a series of extracted-pole sections can be naturally generated with no more operations, thus deriving a mixed topology transversal array directly. To show the flexibility of this paper, a couple of examples, including fully canonical cases and fully extracted-pole cases (considered as a particular kind of mixed topology filters here), are demonstrated. Moreover, a miniaturized coupled line structure is proposed to properly construct filters of fully extracted poles, which provides a reasonable possibility to design compact planar mixed topology filters, in comparison with others in the literature. The simulated and measured results are in good agreement.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Coupling Matrix and Admittance Function Synthesis for Mixed Topology Filters","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2614666","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7776993/07590062.pdf","startPage":"4444","endPage":"4454","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2614666","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7776993","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590062","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590062/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Coupling Matrix and Admittance Function Synthesis for Mixed Topology Filters","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7590062/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272471 and 61671421"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Coupling Matrix and Admittance Function Synthesis for Mixed Topology Filters","sourcePdf":"tmtt-sun-2614666-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12468S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7776993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7776993","articleId":"7590062","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7590068,"authors":[{"name":"Dianfeng Zhang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Dianfeng","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-1137-8634","id":"37071015100"},{"name":"Xi-Ming Sun","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xi-Ming","lastName":"Sun","id":"37534904400"},{"name":"Zhaojing Wu","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Informational Science, Yantai University, Yantai, China"],"firstName":"Zhaojing","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278598500"},{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085688327"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7590068","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Nonlinear systems","Stochastic systems","Asymptotic stability","Numerical stability","Stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","probability","stochastic systems","switching systems (control)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dissipativity","stochastic nonlinear systems","state-dependent switching","switching instants","state trajectory","It\u00f4's formula","Dynkin formula","stopping times","sufficient conditions","switched stochastic systems","global asymptotic stability","input-to-state stability","probability","Lyapunov function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dissipation inequality","dissipativity","Dynkin\u2019s formula","multiple Lyapunov functions","switched stochastic systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590068","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7795265/07590068.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"90","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2617558","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2617558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7795265","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dissipativity for a Class of Stochastic Nonlinear Systems With State-Dependent Switching","abstract":"Dissipativity of stochastic nonlinear systems with state-dependent switching is investigated in this brief.

The objective of the MVNO is to maximize its profit while guaranteeing the backhaul constraint and users' QoS by jointly allocating the slices and the uplink transmit power to the users. To solve the formulated mixed integer non-convex problem, we propose a distributed solution framework based on Lagrangian relaxation to a find suboptimal decision about slice and transmit power allocations.

This trend towards big-data multimedia processing finds its natural placement together with the adoption of the cloud computing paradigm, that seems the best solution to cope with the demands of a highly fluctuating workload that characterizes this type of services. However, as cloud data centers become more and more powerful, energy consumption becomes a major challenge both for environmental concerns and for economic reasons. An effective approach to improve energy efficiency in cloud data centers is to rely on traffic engineering techniques to dynamically adapt the number of active servers to the current workload. Towards this aim, we propose a joint computing-plus-communication optimization framework exploiting virtualization technologies, called MMGreen. Our proposal specifically addresses the typical scenario of multimedia data processing with computationally intensive tasks and exchange of a big volume of data. The proposed framework not only ensures users the Quality of Service (through Service Level Agreements), but also achieves maximum energy saving and attains green cloud computing goals in a fully distributed fashion by utilizing the DVFS-based CPU frequencies. To evaluate the actual effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conduct experiments with MMGreen under real-world and synthetic workload traces. The results of the experiments show that MMGreen may significantly reduce the energy cost for computing, communication and reconfiguration with respect to the previous resource provisioning strategies, respecting the SLA constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2016.2617367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9280471","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2016.2617367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/9280471/07590092.pdf","startPage":"1162","endPage":"1175","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Computing-Plus-Communication Optimization Framework for Multimedia Processing in Cloud Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Computing-Plus-Communication Optimization Framework for Multimedia Processing in Cloud Systems","volume":"8","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2020","dateOfInsertion":"03 December 2020","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590092/","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2020","accessionNumber":"20261867","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590092/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Computing-Plus-Communication Optimization Framework for Multimedia Processing in Cloud Systems","sourcePdf":"tcc-shojafar-2617367-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.207249S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"9280471","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"9280471","articleId":"7590092","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7590098,"authors":[{"name":"Gilbert P.

By characterizing these subfield subcodes, an explicit construction of BCH codes for the Rosenbloom-Tsfasman metric is provided. Two important properties of Reed-Solomon codes and BCH codes for the Rosenbloom-Tsfasman metric are studied and compared with those for the Hamming metric.

This method is also simple as only a single SOA is required. Photonic switching of a 200-Mb/s 16-QAM signal centered at 20 GHz is performed. The signal after switching is an OSSB signal, which has a 22.65- or 17.85-dB sideband suppression ratio for switching based on wavelength down- or up-conversion, respectively. An investigation with the switched signals to combat the dispersion-induced power fading effect for radio over fiber application is also taken.

In recent years, renewed interest on this topic was kindled by two groups of researchers. Narang and Ortega constructed two-channel filter banks on bipartitie graphs described by Laplacians. Sandryhaila and Moura developed the theory of linear systems, filtering, and frequency responses for the case of graphs with arbitrary adjacency matrices, and showed applications in signal compression, prediction, etc. Inspired by these contributions, this paper extends classical multirate signal processing ideas to graphs. The graphs are assumed to be general with a possibly nonsymmetric and complex adjacency matrix. The paper revisits ideas, such as noble identities, aliasing, and polyphase decompositions in graph multirate systems. Drawing such a parallel to classical systems allows one to design filter banks with polynomial filters, with lower complexity than arbitrary graph filters. It is shown that the extension of classical multirate theory to graphs is nontrivial, and requires certain mathematical restrictions on the graph. Thus, classical noble identities cannot be taken for granted. Similarly, one cannot claim that the so-called delay chain system is a perfect reconstruction system (as in classical filter banks). It will also be shown that M-partite extensions of the bipartite filter bank results will not work for M-channel filter banks, but a more restrictive condition called M-block cyclic property should be imposed. Such graphs are studied in detail. A detailed theory for M-channel filter banks is developed in a companion paper.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2617833","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7748608/07590120.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2617833","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7748608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending Classical Multirate Signal Processing Theory to Graphs\u2014Part I: Fundamentals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590120","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7748608/7590120-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590120/","displayDocTitle":"Extending Classical Multirate Signal Processing Theory to Graphs\u2014Part I: Fundamentals","volume":"65","issue":"2","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16466521","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590120/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-11-1-0676 and N00014-15-1-2118"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006961","fundingName":"California Institute of Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Extending Classical Multirate Signal Processing Theory to Graphs\u2014Part I: Fundamentals","sourcePdf":"tsp-teke-2617833-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115531S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7748608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7748608","articleId":"7590120","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7590145,"authors":[{"name":"Martijn Bouss\u00e9","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7748608/7590145/bouss-2617858-small.gif","p":["Martijn Bouss\u00e9 (S\u201915) received the M.Sc. degree in\n mathematical engineering from KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 2014.

In this paper, we use low-rank matrix or tensor representations for signal compression. We propose a new deterministic method for blind source separation that exploits the low-rank structure, enabling a unique separation of the source signals and providing a way to cope with large-scale data. We explain that our method reformulates the blind source separation problem as the computation of a tensor decomposition, after reshaping the observed data matrix into a tensor. This deterministic tensorization technique is called segmentation and is closely related to Hankel-based tensorization. We apply the same strategy to the mixing coefficients of the blind source separation problem, as in many large-scale applications, the mixture is also compressible because of many closely located sensors. Moreover, we combine both strategies, resulting in a general technique that allows us to exploit the underlying compactness of the sources and the mixture simultaneously. We illustrate the techniques for fetal electrocardiogram extraction and direction-of-arrival estimation in large-scale antenna arrays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16466516","htmlLink":"/document/7590145/","displayDocTitle":"A Tensor-Based Method for Large-Scale Blind Source Separation Using Segmentation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003132","fundingName":"Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (IWT)"},{"fundingName":"Research Council KU Leuven","grantNumber":"C16/15/059-nD and CoE PFV/10/002"},{"fundingName":"OPTEC","grantNumber":"G.0830.14N and G.0881.14N"},{"fundingName":"Belgian Federal Science Policy Office IUAP"},{"fundingName":"DYSCO, Dynamical systems, control and optimization"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Union's Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"FP7/2007\u20132013"},{"fundingName":"ERC Advanced Grant BIOTENSORS","grantNumber":"339804"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Tensor-Based Method for Large-Scale Blind Source Separation Using Segmentation","sourcePdf":"tsp-bousse-2617858-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105518S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7748608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7748608","articleId":"7590145","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-04"},{"_id":7590147,"authors":[{"name":"Thang X.

Among promising technology candidates to overcome this problem, cloud radio access network (C-RAN) has received much attention. In this paper, we investigate the design of fronthaul in C-RAN uplink by focusing on the compression and optimization in fronthaul uplinks based on the statistics of wireless fading channels. First, we derive the system block error rate (BLER) under Rayleigh fading channels. In particular, upper and lower bounds of the BLER union bound are obtained in closed-form. From these bounds, we gain insight in terms of diversity order and limits of the BLER. Next, we propose adaptive compression schemes to minimize the fronthaul transmission rate subject to a BLER constraint. Furthermore, a fronthaul rate allocation is proposed to minimize the system BLER. It is shown that the uniform rate allocation approaches the optimal scheme as the total fronthauls' bandwidth increases. Finally, numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed optimizations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Cloud Radio Access Networks: Compression and Optimization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2617826","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7723947/07590147.pdf","startPage":"228","endPage":"241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2617826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723947","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590147","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590147/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Cloud Radio Access Networks: Compression and Optimization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7590147/","dateOfInsertion":"08 November 2016","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16442675","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001348","fundingName":"Agency for Science Technology and Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004815","fundingName":"SERC","grantNumber":"1224104048"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001459","fundingName":"MOE"},{"fundingName":"ARF Tier 2","grantNumber":"MOE2014-T2-2-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Cloud Radio Access Networks: Compression and Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-vu-2617826-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124958S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7723947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7723947","articleId":"7590147","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7590148,"authors":[{"name":"Cong Liu","affiliation":["Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4629386/8789434/7590148/liu-2617331-small.gif","p":["Cong Liu received the BS and the MS degree in computer software and theory from Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China, in 2013 and 2015 respectively.

There comes the cross-organization business process management, and its modeling is a complicated task. Mining a cross-organization business process aims to discover its model from a set of distributed event logs. Unfortunately, traditional process mining approaches totally neglect the privacy-preservation issue, which means the privacy of both event log and business process model. In this paper, a privacy-preservation cross-organization business process mining framework is proposed to handle its privacy issues. It includes three steps: (1) each organization discovers its private and public business process models from its event logs; (2) the trusted third-party midware takes the public process models as input and generates cooperative public process model fragments of each organization; and (3) each organization combines its private business process model with its relevant public fragments to obtain the organization-specific cross-organization cooperative business process model. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach, a multi-modal cross-organization transportation case is used for its validation and comparison with other methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4629386/8789434/07590148.pdf","startPage":"639","endPage":"653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","doi":"10.1109/TSC.2016.2617331","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSC.2016.2617331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8789434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Comprehensive Support for Privacy Preservation Cross-Organization Business Process Mining","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Organizations","Privacy","Data mining","Transportation","Standards organizations","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","business process re-engineering","data mining","data privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-organization business process management","distributed event logs","privacy-preservation cross-organization business process mining framework","public process model fragments","private business process model","organization-specific cross-organization","multimodal cross-organization transportation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Business process privacy","business process management","cross-organization process mining","Petri nets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug. 1 2019","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Towards Comprehensive Support for Privacy Preservation Cross-Organization Business Process Mining","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7590148/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 July-Aug. 2019","accessionNumber":"18884011","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472229, 61472284 and 61602279"},{"fundingName":"Sci. & Tech.

Different from the previous results, the control directions of the considered systems are completely unknown. Adopting the adding a power integrator design technique, we develop an adaptive switching controller with a tuning parameter. Due to control directions unknown, a novel logic switching regulation is established based on Lyapunov function method to overcome this main obstacle. According to this switching rule, the design parameter is tuned online in a switching way. With the help of the obtained adaptive switching controller, the global finite-time stability of the closed-loop systems is shown. To verify the effectiveness of the control algorithm, a simulation example is presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics:

simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) multiple-input single-output (MISO) system with multiple users, beamforming requires all the transmitters know the channel state information (CSI) of the whole system. We relax it so that it is a practical assumption: Each transmitter only knows its own CSI to all the receivers, combined with individual power constraints at transmitters and signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at information receivers. The objective is to maximize the total harvested energy at the energy receivers. An improved version of the alternating direction method of multipliers is proposed. In particular, we split an optimization problem with nonconvex constraints into iterations of several singular value decomposition (SVD) problems and prove the convergence. Simulation results show that our algorithm achieves less computational complexity and control channel budget with acceptable performance degradation when compared with a centralized solution.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2616420","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07590161.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2616420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"5440","endPage":"5445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed Beamforming in MISO SWIPT System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590161","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/7951139/7590161-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Beamforming in MISO SWIPT System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590161/","volume":"66","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7590161/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965064","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"PSFC","grantNumber":"2015M572358"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61301182, 61601309, 61171071 and 61575126"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"20134408120004"},{"fundingName":"Key Project of Guangdong Education Department","grantNumber":"2015KTSCX121, 2015A030313552 and 2013B021500017"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"KQCX20140509172609163, JCYJ20160422093217170, JCYJ20160422112909302 and GJHS2016032814558586"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"000025"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Distributed Beamforming in MISO SWIPT System","sourcePdf":"tvt-dai-2616420-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070518S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7590161","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7590162,"authors":[{"name":"Aryan Mokhtari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7723947/7590162/mokht-2617829-small.gif","p":["Aryan Mokhtari received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering in\n 2011 from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2014 from the\n University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA, where since 2012, he has been working toward the Ph.D. degree in\n the Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering.

The use of distributed gradient methods is a common approach to solve this problem. Their popularity notwithstanding, these methods exhibit slow convergence and a consequent large number of communications between nodes to approach the optimal argument because they rely on first-order information only. This paper proposes the network Newton (NN) method as a distributed algorithm that incorporates second-order information. This is done via distributed implementation of approximations of a suitably chosen Newton step. The approximations are obtained by truncation of the Newton step's Taylor expansion. This leads to a family of methods defined by the number K of Taylor series terms kept in the approximation. When keeping K terms of the Taylor series, the method is called NN-K and can be implemented through the aggregation of information in K-hop neighborhoods. Convergence to a point close to the optimal argument at a rate that is at least linear is proven and the existence of a tradeoff between convergence time and the distance to the optimal argument is shown. The numerical experiments corroborate reductions in the number of iterations and the communication cost that are necessary to achieve convergence relative to first-order alternatives.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Newton Distributed Optimization Methods","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2617829","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7723947/07590162.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2617829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723947","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590162","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7723947/7590162-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590162/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Network Newton Distributed Optimization Methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7590162/","dateOfInsertion":"31 October 2016","publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16442682","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0952867"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"ONR N00014-12-1-0997"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61004137"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Network Newton Distributed Optimization Methods","sourcePdf":"tsp-ribeiro-2617829-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.163537S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7723947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"7723947","articleId":"7590162","onlineDate":"13 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7590203,"authors":[{"name":"Al\u00edrio Boaventura","affiliation":["Departamento de Eletr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Al\u00edrio","lastName":"Boaventura","id":"37947886100"},{"name":"Jo\u00e3o Santos","affiliation":["Departamento de Eletr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Jo\u00e3o","lastName":"Santos","id":"37331139300"},{"name":"Arnaldo Oliveira","affiliation":["Departamento de Eletr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Arnaldo","lastName":"Oliveira","id":"37363292800"},{"name":"Nuno Borges Carvalho","affiliation":["Departamento de Eletr\u00f3nica, Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es e Inform\u00e1tica, Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno Borges","lastName":"Carvalho","id":"37264877100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1527-3342"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9581"}],"articleNumber":"7590203","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1498},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://mtt.org/index.html"}],"abstract":"Passive RF identification (RFID) readers transmit a continuous wave (CW) powering signal to remotely power up batteryless transponders, while simultaneously receiving a backscattered signal at the same frequency [1]. To separate the transmitter and receiver paths, readers use either a bistatic or monostatic antenna configuration. The first configuration employs two separate antennas, one to transmit and one to receive; in the second, the transmitter and receiver share a common antenna by means of a coupler or circulator. Both cases, however, suffer from poor transmitter-to-receiver isolation: strong CW signals can leak into the receiver, degrading its sensitivity to the weak transponder backscattered signals. Receiver sensitivity degradation occurs due to the leaked local oscillator (LO) phase noise [1] and also to the saturation of the front end caused by strong CW leakage. This requires high-dynamic-range capability in the RF stage [the low-noise amplifier (LNA) and mixer] as well as in the baseband stage [the amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs)].","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/6668/7590011/07590203.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MMM.2016.2600942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MMM.2016.2600942","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590011","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perfect Isolation: Dealing with Self-Jamming in Passive RFID Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Phase noise","Radio frequency","Jamming","Baseband","Passive RFID tags","Sensitivity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue-digital conversion","backscatter","jamming","low noise amplifiers","phase noise","radiofrequency identification","transponders"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive RF identification readers","passive RFID readers","continuous wave powering signal","batteryless transponders","backscattered signal","transmitter paths","receiver paths","bistatic antenna configuration","monostatic antenna configuration","coupler","circulator","receiver sensitivity degradation","leaked local oscillator phase noise","high-dynamic-range capability","low-noise amplifier","LNA","analog-to-digital converters","ADC","self-jamming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590203/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Perfect Isolation: Dealing with Self-Jamming in Passive RFID Systems","volume":"17","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7590203/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16378841","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perfect Isolation: Dealing with Self-Jamming in Passive RFID Systems","sourcePdf":"17mmm11-boaventura-2600942-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090009S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6668","isNumber":"7590011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6668","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7590011","articleId":"7590203","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7590300,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Fu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Industrial, Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Fu","id":"37085442453"},{"name":"Youmin Zhang","affiliation":["Shaanxi Key Laboratory of Complex System Control and Intelligent Information Processing, Xi'an University of Technology, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China","Department of Mechanical and Industrial, Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada"],"firstName":"Youmin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405807400"},{"name":"Xiang Yu","affiliation":["Hunan University, Changsha, Hunan, China","College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085445841"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8985"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-959X"}],"articleNumber":"7590300","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":942},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590300","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","Collision avoidance","Trajectory","Air safety","Aircraft navigation","Military communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace safety","autonomous aerial vehicles","collision avoidance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sense and collision avoidance strategy","unmanned aerial vehicles","UAV landing phase","civilian application","military application","manned aircraft safety","SAA system","SAA scheme","sensing unit","conflict detection unit","collision avoidance unit","flight controller unit"]}],"abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) become promising in different civilian and military applications due to their lower cost and greater flexibility in comparison to manned aircraft.

In this study, we analyze the outage capacities of SIC and JD in the case of single-block transmission over a two-user Gaussian multiple-access channel with partial channel state information at transmitter from the perspective of information theory. Results of the analysis and numerals show that compared to SIC, JD can achieve a sum-rate gain of up to 10% or sum-power gain of 0.8 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of outage capacity of NOMA: SIC vs. JD","publicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","doi":"10.1109/TST.2016.7590322","displayPublicationTitle":"Tsinghua Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5971803/7590313/07590322.pdf","startPage":"538","endPage":"543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TST.2016.7590322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"TUP","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590322/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of outage capacity of NOMA: SIC vs. JD","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analysis of outage capacity of NOMA: SIC vs. JD","sourcePdf":"538-543.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038476S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","isNumber":"7590313","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5971803","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7590322","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"TUP","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590387,"authors":[{"name":"Zhirong Shen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University"],"lastName":"Zhirong Shen","id":"38666647500"},{"name":"Patrick P.

Cooperative regeneration has been extensively studied to minimize the repair traffic of simultaneously reconstructing the lost data of multiple failed nodes. However, existing cooperative regeneration schemes assume that nodes are homogeneous. They do not consider how to minimize the general regenerating cost when taking into account node heterogeneity. This paper presents the first systematic study on enhancing conventional cooperation regeneration (CCR) schemes in a heterogeneous environment. We formulate cooperative regeneration as a cost-based routing optimization model, and propose a new cost-based heterogeneity-aware cooperative regeneration (HCR) framework. The main novelty of HCR is to decompose CCR schemes into two stages (i.e., expansion and aggregation) that can be opportunistically carried out by different nodes depending on their costs. To efficiently select the nodes for expansion execution without exhaustive enumeration, we design two greedy algorithms based on the hill-climbing technique. We also formulate the routing problem in the aggregation stage as a Steiner Tree Problem. Finally, we conduct extensive trace-driven simulations and show that HCR can reduce up to 75.4% transmission time of CCR. Also, we demonstrate that HCR remains robust even when the heterogeneity information is not accurately measured.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peer-to-peer computing","Maintenance engineering","Encoding","Routing","Redundancy","Optimization","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative systems","data handling","greedy algorithms","storage area networks","storage management","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative data regeneration","heterogeneous storage networks","conventional cooperation regeneration","cost-based routing optimization model","heterogeneity-aware cooperative regeneration","HCR","CCR","greedy algorithms","hill-climbing technique","Steiner tree problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590387","doi":"10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590387","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7584862/7590385/07590387.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590387","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590387/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient routing for cooperative data regeneration in heterogeneous storage networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 June 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16379988","htmlLink":"/document/7590387/","conferenceDate":"20-21 June 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient routing for cooperative data regeneration in heterogeneous storage networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"2EfficientRoutingforCooperative.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125713S","chronDate":"20-21 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7584862","isNumber":"7590385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7584862","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7590385","articleId":"7590387","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590412,"authors":[{"name":"Olumuyiwa Ibidunmoye","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden"],"firstName":"Olumuyiwa","lastName":"Ibidunmoye","id":"37085878050"},{"name":"Thijs Metsch","affiliation":["Collinstown Industrial Park, Intel Labs Europe, Leixlip, Ireland"],"firstName":"Thijs","lastName":"Metsch","id":"38233758500"},{"name":"Erik Elmroth","affiliation":["Department of Computing Science, Ume\u00e5 University, Ume\u00e5, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Elmroth","id":"37400881000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2635-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7590412","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":371},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Measurement","Bandwidth","Real-time systems","Probability density function","Kernel","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance anomaly real-time detection","cloud services","service performance degradation","downtimes","Internet","online services","performance-end-user satisfaction correlation"]}],"abstract":"Service performance degradation and downtimes are a common on the Internet today.

But the power consumption has become skyrocketing for MSP as it gravely affects the profit of MSP. Previous work often studied the power consumption in C-RAN and MCC separately while less work had considered the integration of C-RAN with MCC. In this paper, we present a unifying framework for optimizing the power-performance tradeoff of MSP by jointly scheduling network resources in C-RAN and computation resources in MCC to minimize the power consumption of MSP while still guaranteeing the QoS for mobile users. Our objective is to maximize the profit of MSP. To achieve this objective, we first formulate the resource scheduling issue as a stochastic problem and then propose a Resource onlIne sCHeduling (RICH) algorithm using Lyapunov optimization technique to approach a time average profit that is close to the optimum with a diminishing gap (1/V) for MSP while still maintaining strong system stability and low congestion to guarantee the QoS for mobile users. With extensive simulations, we demonstrate that the profit of RICH algorithm is 3.3\u00d7 (18.4\u00d7) higher than that of active (random) algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590428","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7584862/7590385/07590428.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic resource scheduling in cloud radio access network with mobile cloud computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590428/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic resource scheduling in cloud radio access network with mobile cloud computing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590428/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16379989","conferenceDate":"20-21 June 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic resource scheduling in cloud radio access network with mobile cloud computing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"43DynamicResourceSchedulinginCloud.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110156S","chronDate":"20-21 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7584862","isNumber":"7590385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7584862","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7590385","articleId":"7590428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590435,"authors":[{"name":"Shaohan Huang","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Shaohan Huang","id":"37085620670"},{"name":"Carol Fung","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, USA"],"lastName":"Carol Fung","id":"37085375874"},{"name":"Kui Wang","affiliation":["Beijing municipal key laboratory of network technology, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Kui Wang","id":"37085623699"},{"name":"Polo Pei","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Polo Pei","id":"37085736144"},{"name":"Zhongzhi Luan","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhongzhi Luan","id":"37303834600"},{"name":"Depei Qian","affiliation":["Sino-German Joint Software Institute, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Depei Qian","id":"37289498500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2634-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2635-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7590435","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":332},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Predictive models","Recurrent neural networks","Measurement","Markov processes","Time series analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed processing","monitoring","noise","object-oriented programming","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["black-box system anomaly prediction","component based enterprise systems","prefailure warning","noise monitoring","recurrent neural networks","RNN","distributed systems","cycle representation","cyclical system behaviors"]}],"abstract":"Component based enterprise systems are becoming extremely complex in which the availability and usability are influenced intensively by the system's anomalies. Anomaly prediction is highly important for ensuring a system's stability, which aims at preventing anomaly from occurring through pre-failure warning. However, due to the system's complex nature and the noise from monitoring, capturing pre-failure symptoms is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a sequential and an averaged recurrent neural networks (RNN) models for distributed systems and component based systems. Specifically, we use cycle representation to capture cyclical system behaviors, which can be used to improve prediction accuracy. The anomaly data used in the experiments is collected from RUBis, IBM System S, and the component based system of enterprise T. The experimental results show that our proposed methods can achieve high prediction accuracy with satisfying lead time. Our recurrent neural networks model also demonstrates time efficiency for monitoring large-scale systems.","doi":"10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590435","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE/ACM 24th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7584862/7590385/07590435.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWQoS.2016.7590435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590385","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using recurrent neural networks toward black-box system anomaly prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590435","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590435/","displayDocTitle":"Using recurrent neural networks toward black-box system anomaly prediction","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16380034","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590435/","conferenceDate":"20-21 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using recurrent neural networks toward black-box system anomaly prediction","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"50UsingRecurrentNeuralNetworks.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075764S","chronDate":"20-21 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7584862","isNumber":"7590385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7584862","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7590385","articleId":"7590435","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590484,"authors":[{"name":"Wenjun Li","affiliation":["Shenzhen Key Lab of Communication and Information Processing, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Wenjun","lastName":"Li","id":"37085676258"},{"name":"Jianhua Ji","affiliation":["Shenzhen Key Lab of Communication and Information Processing, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Ji","id":"37393399800"},{"name":"Guirong Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Key Lab of Communication and Information Processing, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Guirong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085887371"},{"name":"Wenlin Zhang","affiliation":["Shenzhen Key Lab of Communication and Information Processing, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China"],"firstName":"Wenlin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085892896"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3326-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3327-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7590484","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive optics","Cryptography","Time complexity","Signal to noise ratio","Optical transmitters","Multiaccess communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cryptography","decoding","encoding","optical information processing","optical receivers","optical transmitters","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer security","optical CDMA","code division multiple access","algorithmic cryptography","optical network","transmitter","optical encoding","physical layer encryption","optical decoding","decryption algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical code division multiple access (OCDMA)","algorithmic cryptography","security"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an optical network with cross-layer security, which can enhance security performance.

In Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS), due to the nature of propagation and navigation in water, they have to be estimated by either physical sensors or raw data or a combination of these and employed to compensate motion errors. Hence, motion compensation is a major issue in SAS. In this paper we propose a new image domain based motion compensation approach which is intended to loosen the restrictions imposed by previously proposed approach such as Displaced Phase Center Approximation (DPCA) and the dependency on an accurate Inertial Navigation System (INS). The real bistatic observation model is replaced by a virtual bistatic model which allows for taking into account rotations between Txs and Rxs. The ping to ping displacements are then obtained by minimizing an error function between theprojections on vector space intersections.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Motion Compensation Approach for SAS","publicationTitle":"2016 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence (SSPD)","doi":"10.1109/SSPD.2016.7590585","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence (SSPD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590275/7590572/07590585.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSPD.2016.7590585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590572","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Motion Compensation Approach for SAS","conferenceDate":"22-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590585/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16396011","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Motion Compensation Approach for SAS","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1181770.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055352S","chronDate":"22-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590275","isNumber":"7590572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590275","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7590572","articleId":"7590585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590588,"authors":[{"name":"Luc Fourtinon","affiliation":["Centre for Electronic Warfare, Cranfield University Shrivenham, UK","Telecom-Bretagne Technopole Brest-Iroise, Brest Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Fourtinon","id":"37085879389"},{"name":"Alessio Balleri","affiliation":["Centre for Electronic Warfare, Cranfield University Shrivenham, UK"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Balleri","id":"37265803200"},{"name":"Yves Quere","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Brest, CNRS UMR 3192 Lab-STICC, Brest Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Quere","id":"37294458200"},{"name":"Christian Person","affiliation":["Telecom-Bretagne Technopole Brest-Iroise, Brest Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Person","id":"37280965600"},{"name":"Annaig Martin-Guennou","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Brest, CNRS UMR 3192 Lab-STICC, Brest Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Annaig","lastName":"Martin-Guennou","id":"37086101966"},{"name":"Eric Rius","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Brest, CNRS UMR 3192 Lab-STICC, Brest Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Rius","id":"37266842300"},{"name":"Guillaume Lesueur","affiliation":["Thales Optronique S.A.S, \u00c9lancourt, France"],"firstName":"Guillaume","lastName":"Lesueur","id":"37319337100"},{"name":"Thomas Merlet","affiliation":["Thales Optronique S.A.S, \u00c9lancourt, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Merlet","id":"37294250900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0326-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0327-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7590588","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Antenna radiation patterns","Antenna arrays","Shape","MATLAB","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","conformal antennas","missiles","radar antennas","radar signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D RF-seeker antenna array","beampattern synthesis","polarisation synthesis","missile radar seeker","mechanical rotating antenna","radiating beam steering","3D conformal antenna array","beampattern characteristics","electromagnetic antenna tool","beamforming analysis","antenna radiation pattern","polarisation pattern analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590588","doi":"10.1109/SSPD.2016.7590588","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SSPD.2016.7590588","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590572","publicationTitle":"2016 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence (SSPD)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Sensor Signal Processing for Defence (SSPD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7590275/7590572/07590588.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beampattern and Polarisation Synthesis of 3D Rf-Seeker Antenna Arrays","abstract":"Existing missile radar seekers use a mechanical rotating antenna to steer the radiating beam in the direction of the target. Recent research is investigating the possibility to replace the mechanical RF seeker with a novel 3D conformal antenna, embedded below the radome, that can steer the beam electronically. 3D conformal antenna arrays may offer many advantages, such as a higher gain and an extended coverage, and new degrees of freedom which derive from the resulting higher flexibility in the choice of the 3D shape. Despite this, they also present new technical challenges, related to the robustness of the beampattern characteristics as a function of the steering angle, that must be addressed. The overall objective of our research is to design, prototype and assess the performance of novel 3D conformal antenna arrays for RF seekers. In order to do this, a first study has been carried out to generate and display the polarisation pattern of any 3D antenna arrays. In this paper, we present an electromagnetic antenna tool that has been developed to carry out an analysis of beamforming and polarisation for any shape of 3D antennas. The program imports the pattern of an individual element of the array and generates the global radiation pattern by coherently summing the contribution of each element. One feature of the tool is the calculation of the polarisation pattern induced by the conformation which provides a complete description of the time varying electric field of the array.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590588/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-23 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-23 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7590588/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16380100","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Beampattern and Polarisation Synthesis of 3D Rf-Seeker Antenna Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beampattern and Polarisation Synthesis of 3D Rf-Seeker Antenna Arrays","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"pid1180800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06263S","chronDate":"22-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7590275","isNumber":"7590572","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7590275","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7590572","articleId":"7590588","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7590600,"authors":[{"name":"Yixin Chen","affiliation":["Centre for Excellence in Signal and Image Processing (CeSIP), Royal College Building, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085654776"},{"name":"Carmine Clemente","affiliation":["Centre for Excellence in Signal and Image Processing (CeSIP), Royal College Building, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Carmine","lastName":"Clemente","id":"37399665900"},{"name":"John Soraghan","affiliation":["Centre for Excellence in Signal and Image Processing (CeSIP), Royal College Building, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Soraghan","id":"37281998700"},{"name":"Stephen Weiss","affiliation":["Centre for Excellence in Signal and Image Processing (CeSIP), Royal College Building, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Weiss","id":"37276935000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0326-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0327-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7590600","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Dictionaries","Matching pursuit algorithms","Delays","Sparse matrices","Doppler effect"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compressed sensing","Fourier transforms","iterative methods","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","time-frequency analysis","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractional Fourier based sparse channel estimation","multicarrier underwater acoustic communication system","UWA channel","fractional Fourier transform","FrFT","orthogonal frequency division multiplex","OFDM","channel dictionary matrix","compressive sampling matching pursuit","CoSaMP","sparse channel coefficients","normalized mean square error","NMSE","basis expansion model","BEM"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a hybrid sparse channel estimation based on Fractional Fourier Transform (FrFT) for orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) scenario to exploit channel sparsity of underwater acoustic (UWA) channel.

Currently, one of the major challenges is to perform acoustic noise reduction in so-called cocktail party scenarios with multiple speakers, in particular because it is difficult-if not impossible-for the algorithm to determine which are the target speaker(s) that should be enhanced, and which speaker(s) should be treated as interfering sources. Recently, it has been shown that electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to perform auditory attention detection, i.e., to detect to which speaker a subject is attending based on recordings of neural activity. In this paper, we combine such an EEG-based auditory attention detection (AAD) paradigm with an acoustic noise reduction algorithm based on the multi-channel Wiener filter (MWF), leading to a neuro-steered MWF. In particular, we analyze how the AAD accuracy affects the noise suppression performance of an adaptive MWF in a sliding-window implementation, where the user switches his attention between two speakers.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590644","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590644.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive attention-driven speech enhancement for EEG-informed hearing prostheses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7590644/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive attention-driven speech enhancement for EEG-informed hearing prostheses","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395424","pubMedId":"28268285","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive attention-driven speech enhancement for EEG-informed hearing prostheses","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00201624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051317S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7590649,"authors":[{"name":"Awais Mansoor","affiliation":["Children's National Health System, Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation, Washington DC"],"firstName":"Awais","lastName":"Mansoor","id":"37288232600"},{"name":"Geovanny Perez","affiliation":["Division of Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, Children\u00e2\u0102\u0179s National Health System, Washington, DC"],"firstName":"Geovanny","lastName":"Perez","id":"37085715235"},{"name":"Gustavo Nino","affiliation":["Division of Pulmonary and Sleep Medicine, Children\u00e2\u0102\u0179s National Health System, Washington, DC"],"firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Nino","id":"37085717671"},{"name":"Marius George Linguraru","affiliation":["School of Medicine and Health Sciences, George Washington University, DC","Children's National Health System, Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation, Washington DC"],"firstName":"Marius George","lastName":"Linguraru","id":"37293995500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590649","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic tissue characterization of air trapping in chest radiographs using deep neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590649","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Charge carrier processes","Lungs","Machine learning","Training","Computed tomography","Visualization","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biological tissues","computerised tomography","diseases","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing","neural nets","pneumodynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic tissue characterization","air trapping","chest radiographs","deep neural networks","computer-aided diagnosis","abnormal pulmonary textures","computed tomography images","pulmonary diagnosis","CXR textures","pulmonary disease","radiation dosage","stacked autoencoder deep learning architecture"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Air","Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Lung","Neural Networks (Computer)","Radiography, Thoracic","Virus Diseases"]}],"abstract":"Significant progress has been made in recent years for computer-aided diagnosis of abnormal pulmonary textures from computed tomography (CT) images. Similar initiatives in chest radiographs (CXR), the common modality for pulmonary diagnosis, are much less developed. CXR are fast, cost effective and low-radiation solution to diagnosis over CT. However, the subtlety of textures in CXR makes them hard to discern even by trained eye. We explore the performance of deep learning abnormal tissue characterization from CXR. Prior studies have used CT imaging to characterize air trapping in subjects with pulmonary disease; however, the use of CT in children is not recommended mainly due to concerns pertaining to radiation dosage. In this work, we present a stacked autoencoder (SAE) deep learning architecture for automated tissue characterization of air-trapping from CXR. To our best knowledge this is the first study applying deep learning framework for the specific problem on 51 CXRs, an F-score of \u2248 76.5% and a strong correlation with the expert visual scoring (R=0.93, p =<; 0.01) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to characterization of air trapping.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590649","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590649.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"100","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590649/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Automatic tissue characterization of air trapping in chest radiographs using deep neural networks","isConference":true,"pubMedId":"28324924","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16394727","htmlLink":"/document/7590649/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic tissue characterization of air trapping in chest radiographs using deep neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00251795.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074725S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590649","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590674,"authors":[{"name":"Ihor Vasyltsov","affiliation":["Software R&D Center, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ihor","lastName":"Vasyltsov","id":"37062639500"},{"name":"Changgyu Bak","affiliation":["Software R&D Center, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea"],"firstName":"Changgyu","lastName":"Bak","id":"37085878044"},{"name":"Jiseung Jeong","affiliation":["Software R&D Center, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jiseung","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37085876159"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590674","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"abstract":"In this paper the application of statistical approach for anomaly detection in a wearable ECG monitor has been considered.

Such comparison can be implemented based on the statistical model of ECG signal. To test the accuracy of the proposed method a ProSim 8 simulator was used to generate ECG signals. Our experiments showed that critical anomalies in ECG, such as Cardiac Failure, different types of Arrhythmia, and ST-segment deviations can be detected with high precision (96~100%), while false positive rate over typical NSR signal is low (<;4%). The method is scalable in terms of required performance, power consumption, and the precision of anomaly detection to be suitable for the implementation in a wearable platform.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590674.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"203","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590674","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical approach for lightweight detection of anomalies in ECG","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Biomedical monitoring","Monitoring","Real-time systems","Morphology","Heart rate variability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","medical signal processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomaly detection","wearable ECG monitor","statistical model","ECG signal","ProSim 8 simulator","cardiac failure","power consumption"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Delivery of Health Care","Electrocardiography","Humans","Motion","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Statistics as Topic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Statistical approach for lightweight detection of anomalies in ECG","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590674/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16394895","pubMedId":"28324926","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical approach for lightweight detection of anomalies in ECG","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00500445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096644S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590674","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590691,"authors":[{"name":"Kimberly Plevniak","affiliation":["Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Kimberly","lastName":"Plevniak","id":"37085881856"},{"name":"Matthew Campbell","affiliation":["Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Campbell","id":"37085878755"},{"name":"Mei He","affiliation":["Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, Kansas State University, Manhattan, KS, USA"],"firstName":"Mei","lastName":"He","id":"37085880775"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590691","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":460},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Microfluidics","Blood","Force","Resins","Surface treatment","Printers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioMEMS","diseases","microfabrication","patient diagnosis","three-dimensional printing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D printed microfluidic mixer","anemia point-of-care diagnosis","fabrication tool","3D microfluidic simulation guided computer design","capillary force","finger-prick blood","3D fabrication","smartphone compatibility","personalized medicine","mobile healthcare"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Anemia","Humans","Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions","Microfluidics","Point-of-Care Systems","Printing, Three-Dimensional","Smartphone"]}],"abstract":"3D printing has been an emerging fabrication tool in prototyping and manufacturing.

The sensor assembly procedure involves using sputtered electrodes in a microfluidic channel with a physiologically relevant height of 50\u03bcm to create a three-dimensional (3D), parallel-plate, capacitive sensing area. The sensor is constructed with biocompatible materials of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) for the substrate and titanium nitride (TiN) for the sensing and floating electrodes. The real part of the complex relative dielectric permittivity of human whole blood is measured from 10kHz to 100MHz using an impedance analyzer and under static conditions. The temporal variation in dielectric permittivity at 1MHz for human whole blood undergoing coagulation shows a peak in permittivity at 5 minutes, which closely matches our previously established results. This sensor can pave the way for monitoring blood coagulation under physiologically relevant shear flow rates in the future.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590697.pdf","startPage":"291","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590697","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PMMA microfluidic dielectric sensor for blood coagulation monitoring at the point-of-care","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coagulation","Microfluidics","Dielectrics","Electrodes","Permittivity","Dielectric measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioelectric phenomena","blood flow measurement","capacitive sensors","coagulation","microchannel flow","microfabrication","microsensors","permittivity","polymers","shear flow","titanium compounds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PMMA microfluidic dielectric sensor","point-of-care","fully biocompatible sensor","human whole blood coagulation monitoring","POC","sensor assembly procedure","sputtered electrodes","microfluidic channel","three-dimensional parallel-plate capacitive sensing area","biocompatible materials","polymethyl methacrylate","floating electrodes","complex relative dielectric permittivity","impedance analyzer","static condition","temporal variation","shear flow rates","size 50 mum","time 5 min","frequency 10 kHz to 100 MHz","TiN"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Blood Coagulation","Electricity","Electrodes","Humans","Microfluidics","Point-of-Care Systems","Polymethyl Methacrylate","Time Factors","Titanium"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590697/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A PMMA microfluidic dielectric sensor for blood coagulation monitoring at the point-of-care","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590697/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395524","pubMedId":"28268334","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PMMA microfluidic dielectric sensor for blood coagulation monitoring at the point-of-care","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00731587.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124974S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590698,"authors":[{"name":"I.

In this way, the nanowires are converted to memristive biosensors paving the way for future molecular diagnostics applications in general, and for detection of prostate cancer disease in particular.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590698","startPage":"295","endPage":"298","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590698.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nano-fabricated memristive biosensors for biomedical applications with liquid and dried samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Nano-fabricated memristive biosensors for biomedical applications with liquid and dried samples","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590698/","accessionNumber":"16395726","pubMedId":"28268335","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590698/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nano-fabricated memristive biosensors for biomedical applications with liquid and dried samples","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00741656.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048729S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590698","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7590733,"authors":[{"name":"Lesley-Ann Duflot","affiliation":["AS2M, ENSMM, Besan\u00e7on, France","Inria Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Lesley-Ann","lastName":"Duflot","id":"37085809581"},{"name":"Alexandre Krupa","affiliation":["Inria Rennes-Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Krupa","id":"37329643400"},{"name":"Brahim Tamadazte","affiliation":["AS2M, ENSMM, Besan\u00e7on, France"],"firstName":"Brahim","lastName":"Tamadazte","id":"37681656800"},{"name":"Nicolas Andreff","affiliation":["AS2M, ENSMM, Besan\u00e7on, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Andreff","id":"37078794000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590733","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Compressed sensing","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical imaging","Optical sensors","Ultrafast optics","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","compressed sensing","image reconstruction","image representation","image resolution","iterative methods","medical image processing","optical tomography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shearlet transform","compressed sensing","optical coherence tomography","OCT","image reconstruction","missing data reconstruction","acquisition time","frame rate","fast iterative soft-thresholding algorithm","FISTA","sparse representation","artefact compensation","patient physiological motions","diagnostic purpose","optical biopsies","3D micrometric resolution optical images"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Artifacts","Biosensing Techniques","Chickens","Epithelium","Feasibility Studies","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Mice","Models, Theoretical","Optics and Photonics","Reproducibility of Results","Tomography, Optical Coherence"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the development of a fast and smart acquisition technique of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) data that has the capability to reconstruct missing data of OCT image. The main objective is to reduce the acquisition time (i.e., increase the frame rate) of an OCT-scan system by choosing a trajectory that covers entirely the image but that does not take all the measurements. The reconstruction of the missing data is achieved by applying an updated Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) on a sparse representation of the image. Several sparse representations have been tested and the shearlets-based approach seems to outperform the other ones (e.g. wavelets, curvelets and by applying bilinear interpolation). The targeted application is a fast OCT imaging solution allowing an efficient compensation of the artefacts induced by the patient physiological motions for diagnostic purpose through optical biopsies (3D micrometric resolution optical images). The obtained results seem promising in terms of low time processing and improvement of the quality of the reconstructed image compared to the traditional sparse acquisition.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590733","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590733.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","startPage":"435","endPage":"438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shearlet transform: A good candidate for compressed sensing in optical coherence tomography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shearlet transform: A good candidate for compressed sensing in optical coherence tomography","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590733/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395682","pubMedId":"28268365","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7590733/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shearlet transform: A good candidate for compressed sensing in optical coherence tomography","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01330254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048462S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590736,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Banco","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Tufts University, Medford, MA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Banco","id":"37085882964"},{"name":"Shuchin Aeron","affiliation":["Dept. of ECE, Tufts University, Medford, MA"],"firstName":"Shuchin","lastName":"Aeron","id":"37283102000"},{"name":"W.

This algebraic approach is more data adaptive, in contrast to existing compressed sensing (CS) based methods that exploit sparsity in a transform domain, such as wavelets or total variation. Further, we compare these tensor factorization approaches in recovering temporal MRI data under limited sampling. Respecting traditional MRI data acquisition methods, the sampling process is restricted to be uniformly random along only one k space direction. Experimental results on synthetically sub-sampled MRI data show promise in using tensor factorization for sampling and recovery of MRI data.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile

Since the labor-intensive and subjective measurement is too time-consuming and unreliable, the development of the automatic FFSP recognition method is highly desirable. Different from the previous methods, we leverage a general framework to recognize the FFSP from US images automatically. Specifically, instead of using the previous hand-crafted visual features, we utilize the recent developed deep learning approach via very deep convolutional networks (DCNN) architecture to represent fine-grained details of US image. Also, very small (3\u00d73) convolution filters are adopted to improve the performance.

However, there is still a need for developing methods suitable to monitor motor symptoms in and outside the clinic. The purpose of this paper was to investigate deep learning as a method for this monitoring. Deep learning recently broke records in speech and image classification, but it has not been fully investigated as a potential approach to analyze wearable sensor data. We collected data from ten patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease using inertial measurement units. Several motor tasks were expert-labeled and used for classification. We specifically focused on the detection of bradykinesia. For this, we compared standard machine learning pipelines with deep learning based on convolutional neural networks. Our results showed that deep learning outperformed other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms by at least 4.6 % in terms of classification rate. We contribute a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of deep learning for sensor-based movement assessment and conclude that deep learning is a promising method for this field.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590787/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7590787/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395288","pubMedId":"28268413","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Recent machine learning advancements in sensor-based mobility analysis: Deep learning for Parkinson's disease assessment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent machine learning advancements in sensor-based mobility analysis: Deep learning for Parkinson's disease assessment","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"01941288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094317S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-10"},{"_id":7590814,"authors":[{"name":"Shi Chao Gao","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Shi Chao","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085478799"},{"name":"Peter Wittek","affiliation":["ICFO-The Institute of Photonic Sciences, University of Bor\u00e5s"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Wittek","id":"37860405300"},{"name":"Li Zhao","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085480017"},{"name":"Wen Jun Jiang","affiliation":["Tsinghua University"],"firstName":"Wen Jun","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085491489"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590814","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":840},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590814","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Blood pressure","Cameras","Mercury (metals)","Biomedical monitoring","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood pressure measurement","cameras","cardiovascular system","discrete wavelet transforms","diseases","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","oximetry","patient monitoring","photoplethysmography","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data-driven estimation","photoplethysmography","PPG signal","blood pressure measurement","optical method","systolic blood pressure","diastolic blood pressure","single-point optical recording","photoplethysmographic signal","automated machine learning algorithms","supervised learning","discrete wavelet transform","PPG waveform","pulse oximeter","smartphone camera","cardiovascular disease","oximeter-obtained PPG","phone-obtained PPG","ambulatory measurement","ubiquitous mobile device","blood pressure monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine Learning","Discrete Wavelet Transform","Blood Pressure","Mobile Health","Big Data"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Adult","Blood Pressure","Blood Pressure Determination","Female","Humans","Male","Oximetry","Photoplethysmography","Wavelet Analysis","Young Adult"]}],"abstract":"Noninvasive measurement of blood pressure by optical methods receives considerable interest, but the complexity of the measurement and the difficulty of adjusting parameters restrict applications. We develop a method for estimating the systolic and diastolic blood pressure using a single-point optical recording of a photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal. The estimation is data-driven, we use automated machine learning algorithms instead of mathematical models. Combining supervised learning with a discrete wavelet transform, the method is insensitive to minor irregularities in the PPG waveform, hence both pulse oximeters and smartphone cameras can record the signal. We evaluate the accuracy of the estimation on 78 samples from 65 subjects (40 male, 25 female, age 29\u00b17) with no history of cardiovascular disease. The estimate for systolic blood pressure has a mean error 4.9\u00b14.9 mm Hg, and 4.3\u00b13.7 mm Hg for diastolic blood pressure when using the oximeter-obtained PPG. The same values are 5.1\u00b14.3 mm Hg and 4.6\u00b14.3 mm Hg when using the phone-obtained PPG, comparing with A&D UA-767PBT result as gold standard. The simplicity of the method encourages ambulatory measurement, and given the ease of sharing the measured data, we expect a shift to data-oriented approaches deriving insight from ubiquitous mobile devices that will yield more accurate machine learning models in monitoring blood pressure.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590814","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590814.pdf","startPage":"766","endPage":"769","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590814","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven estimation of blood pressure using photoplethysmographic signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven estimation of blood pressure using photoplethysmographic signals","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7590814/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395482","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","pubMedId":"28324937","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590814/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven estimation of blood pressure using photoplethysmographic signals","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"02310551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05493S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":7590821,"authors":[{"name":"Lilin Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Lilin","lastName":"Guo","id":"38502218500"},{"name":"Zhenzhong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Zhenzhong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085483283"},{"name":"Mercedes Cabrerizo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Mercedes","lastName":"Cabrerizo","id":"37946075000"},{"name":"Malek Adjouadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Malek","lastName":"Adjouadi","id":"37285029100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590821","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Neurons","Encoding","Delays","Charge coupled devices","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroencephalography","encoding","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical disorders","medical signal processing","neurophysiology","patient monitoring","signal classification","spatiotemporal phenomena"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-correlated delay shift rule","spiking neural networks","interictal spike detection","associated spatiotemporal patterns","spike pattern classification","CCDS rule","electroencephalogram","EEG signal","epilepsy","encoding method","detection rate","EEG record monitoring","ReSuMe"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Algorithms","Electroencephalography","Epilepsy","Humans","Machine Learning","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Neurons"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of cross-correlated delay shift rule in spiking neural networks for interictal spike detection","abstract":"This study proposes a Cross-Correlated Delay Shift (CCDS) supervised learning rule to train neurons with associated spatiotemporal patterns to classify spike patterns.

Despite advances in computation and algorithms, the goal of automated lung sound identification and classification has remained elusive. Over the past 40 years, published work in this field has demonstrated only limited success in identifying lung sounds, with most published studies using only a small numbers of patients (typically N<;20) and usually limited to a single type of lung sound. Larger research studies have also been impeded by the challenge of labeling large volumes of data, which is extremely labor-intensive. In this paper, we present the development of a semi-supervised deep learning algorithm for automatically classify lung sounds from a relatively large number of patients (N=284). Focusing on the two most common lung sounds, wheeze and crackle, we present results from 11,627 sound files recorded from 11 different auscultation locations on these 284 patients with pulmonary disease. 890 of these sound files were labeled to evaluate the model, which is significantly larger than previously published studies. Data was collected with a custom mobile phone application and a low-cost (US$30) electronic stethoscope. On this data set, our algorithm achieves ROC curves with AUCs of 0.86 for wheeze and 0.74 for crackle. Most importantly, this study demonstrates how semi-supervised deep learning can be used with larger data sets without requiring extensive labeling of data.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590823","startPage":"804","endPage":"807","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590823.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of semi-supervised deep learning to lung sound analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Application of semi-supervised deep learning to lung sound analysis","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590823/","accessionNumber":"16395513","pubMedId":"28324938","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590823/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of semi-supervised deep learning to lung sound analysis","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"02401773.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052669S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7590825,"authors":[{"name":"Guangliang Yu","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Guangliang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085882054"},{"name":"Xiang Li","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085880303"},{"name":"Dawei Song","affiliation":["The Computing Department, The Open University, United Kingdom","Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Dawei","lastName":"Song","id":"37085877601"},{"name":"Xiaozhao Zhao","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Xiaozhao","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085578853"},{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37652265600"},{"name":"Yuexian Hou","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Cognitive Computing and Application, Tianjin University, China"],"firstName":"Yuexian","lastName":"Hou","id":"37555869000"},{"name":"Bin Hu","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Lanzhou University, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Hu","id":"37307887900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590825","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrooculography","Convolution","Feature extraction","Physiology","Time series analysis","Support vector machines","Time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electro-oculography","magnetoencephalography","medical signal processing","neural nets","random processes","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["physiological signal encoding","affective state recognition","convolutional neural networks","hand-crafted features","domain knowledge","raw signals","noise interference","dimensionality curse","CNN","DECAF dataset","support vector machines","SVM","random forest"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Emotions","Humans","Neural Networks (Computer)","Support Vector Machine"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590825","abstract":"Affective state recognition based on multiple modalities of physiological signals has been a hot research topic.

Hence, in this preliminary study we recorded high resolution electroencephalography (EEG) from 5 subjects while driving a car under real conditions along with an accelerometer which detects the onset of steering. Two sensor-level analyses, sample entropy and time-frequency analysis, have been implemented to observe the dynamics before the onset of steering. Thus, in order to classify the steering direction we applied a machine learning algorithm consisting of: dimensionality reduction and classification using principal-component-analysis (PCA) and support-vector-machine (SVM), respectively. The results showed an increase of the sample entropy and the estimated power values in the theta and alpha frequency bands, 100 ms before the onset of steering. The detection of steering direction depicted that sample entropy gives a higher classification accuracy (73.5% \u00b16.8) as compared to that of using the estimated power for theta and alpha frequency bands (62.6% \u00b15.6).","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590830","startPage":"833","endPage":"836","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590830.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of steering direction using EEG recordings based on sample entropy and time-frequency analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Detection of steering direction using EEG recordings based on sample entropy and time-frequency analysis","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590830/","accessionNumber":"16395857","pubMedId":"28268453","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590830/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of steering direction using EEG recordings based on sample entropy and time-frequency analysis","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"02470789.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106593S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590832,"authors":[{"name":"Shuang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Shuang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085350025"},{"name":"Jingjing Tong","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Tong","id":"37085883182"},{"name":"Minpeng Xu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Minpeng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37850640000"},{"name":"Jiajia Yang","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jiajia","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085359402"},{"name":"Hongzhi Qi","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Hongzhi","lastName":"Qi","id":"37273173400"},{"name":"Dong Ming","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Ming","id":"37315327900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590832","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"abstract":"Electroencephalographic (EEG)-based emotion recognition has attracted increasing attention from the field of human-computer interaction (HCI). However, there are a number of challenges for machines to correctly recognize human emotional states. One problem is how to generalize the emotion model across time, since the brain may show different patterns of EEG for the same emotion experience at different time. This study investigated the feasibility of adding samples from different days to the training set to improve the generalization of the emotion classifier. Eight subjects participated in this experiment, and they were asked to watch different kinds of movie clips to produce neutral, positive or negative emotional states for different trials. Five sessions in five different days were conducted for each subject. EEG signals were recorded throughout the experiment. Support vector machine was used to perform a classification of the three emotional states, in which the training samples may come from 1, 2, 3 or 4 days' sessions but have a same number. The results showed that three categories were classified with average accuracies of 64.9%, 68.7%, 70.9%, and 73.0% respectively for 1-day, 2-day, 3-day and 4-day conditions. N-day condition represented the case in which data from N days were sent to train the SVM and the remaining 5-N days were used to form the testing set. Importantly, the accuracy had an increasing trend with the number of days in the training set for all subjects. Compared with 1-day condition, the accuracy of 4-day condition has about 10% improvement with a peak of 81.2% By analyzing the selected features in 4-day condition, we found the distributions of the selected features were relatively stable across days. The classifier did select emotion-relevant features and reject time-relevant features. These results suggested that incorporation of samples from different days to the training set could improve the generalization of an emotion classifier across time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

using single-channel scalp-EEG recording","abstract":"Several studies have found evidence for corticolimbic Theta electroencephalographic (EEG) oscillation in the neural processing of visual stimuli perceived as fear or threatening scene. Recent studies showed that neural oscillations' patterns in Theta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma sub-bands play a main role in brain's emotional processing. The main goal of this study is to classify two different emotional states by means of EEG data recorded through a single-electrode EEG headset. Nineteen young subjects participated in an EEG experiment while watching a video clip that evoked three emotional states: neutral, relaxation and scary. Following each video clip, participants were asked to report on their subjective affect by giving a score between 0 to 10. First, recorded EEG data were preprocessed by stationary wavelet transform (SWT) based denoising to remove artifacts. Afterward, the distribution of power in time-frequency space was obtained using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and then, the mean value of energy was calculated for each EEG sub-band. Finally, 46 features, as the mean energy of frequency bands between 4 and 50 Hz, containing 689 instances - for each subject -were collected in order to classify the emotional states. Our experimental results show that EEG dynamics induced by horror and relaxing movies can be classified with average classification rate of 92% using support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We also compared the performance of SVM to K-nearest neighbors (K-NN). The results show that K-NN achieves a better classification rate by 94% accuracy. The findings of this work are expected to pave the way to a new horizon in neuroscience by proving the point that only single-channel EEG data carry enough information for emotion classification.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590833/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16394846","pubMedId":"28268456","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590833/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Emotion classification using single-channel scalp-EEG recording","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Emotion classification using single-channel scalp-EEG recording","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"02501145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091507S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590833","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7590836,"authors":[{"name":"Lan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Lan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085696807"},{"name":"Thierry Blu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Blu","id":"37085397411"},{"name":"William S-Y.

This study proposes and evaluates a novel EEG Blind Source Separation (BSS) algorithm based on a weak exclusion principle (WEP). The chief point in which it differs from most previous EEG BSS algorithms is that the proposed algorithm is not based upon the hypothesis that the sources are statistically independent. Our first step was to investigate algorithm performance on simulated signals which have ground truth. The purpose of this simulation is to illustrate the proposed algorithm's efficacy. The results show that the proposed algorithm has good separation performance. Then, we used the proposed algorithm to separate real EEG signals from a memory study using a revised version of Sternberg Task. The results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively separate the non-brain and brain sources.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590836.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"862","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An EEG blind source separation algorithm based on a weak exclusion principle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electroencephalography","Blind source separation","Signal processing algorithms","Matrix decomposition","Surfaces","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","electroencephalography","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EEG blind source separation algorithm","weak exclusion principle","nonbrain signals","volume conduction","electroencephalography","contemporary neuroscience"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Brain","Computer Simulation","Electroencephalography","Female","Humans","Middle Aged","Models, Theoretical","Neuropsychological Tests","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An EEG blind source separation algorithm based on a weak exclusion principle","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590836/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395586","pubMedId":"28268459","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An EEG blind source separation algorithm based on a weak exclusion principle","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"02532329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048596S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590857,"authors":[{"name":"Anas Delane","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Applied Science, Gonzaga University, Spokane, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Anas","lastName":"Delane","id":"37085905464"},{"name":"Jorge Boh\u00f3rquez","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Miami, Coral Gables, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Boh\u00f3rquez","id":"37377564500"},{"name":"Subhanshu Gupta","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Subhanshu","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37421711100"},{"name":"Martin Schiavenato","affiliation":["College of Nursing, Washington State University, Spokane, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Schiavenato","id":"37946770500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590857","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"abstract":"Heart rate variability analysis is a promising method for measuring pain in premature infants.

Early detection of AD makes it possible for patients to access appropriate services and to benefit from new treatments and therapies, as and when they become available. The onset of AD starts many years before the clinical symptoms become clear. A biomarker that can measure the brain changes in this period would be useful for early diagnosis of AD. Potentially, the electroencephalogram (EEG) can play a valuable role in early detection of AD. Damage in the brain due to AD leads to changes in the information processing activity of the brain and the EEG which can be quantified as a biomarker. The objective of the study reported in this paper is to develop robust EEG-based biomarkers for detecting AD in its early stages. We present a new approach to quantify the slowing of the EEG, one of the most consistent features at different stages of dementia, based on changes in the EEG amplitudes (\u0394EEG\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">A</sub>\n). The new approach has sensitivity and specificity values of 100% and 88.88%, respectively, and outperformed the Lempel-Ziv Complexity (LZC) approach in discriminating between AD and normal subjects.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590869","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590869.pdf","startPage":"993","endPage":"996","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Changes in the EEG amplitude as a biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer's disease","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Changes in the EEG amplitude as a biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer's disease","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7590869/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395705","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","pubMedId":"28268491","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590869/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Changes in the EEG amplitude as a biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer's disease","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"02862048.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059202S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7590922,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Abdolhoseini","affiliation":["School of Electrical Eng and Computer Science, The University of Newcastle, NSW"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Abdolhoseini","id":"37085901962"},{"name":"Frederick Walker","affiliation":["School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, The University of Newcastle"],"firstName":"Frederick","lastName":"Walker","id":"37085904467"},{"name":"Sarah Johnson","affiliation":["School of Electrical Eng and Computer Science, The University of Newcastle"],"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37269954100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7590922","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"abstract":"Microglia are immune cells of the central nervous system. Good knowledge about their morphology leads us to a better understanding of their functionality. In this article we propose an automated method to trace microglia in microscopy images. Our approach is powered by two main algorithms: multilevel thresholding (MT) and minimum spanning tree (MST). MT quantizes intensities of image pixels to several levels, then we sample each level with different rates to produce seed points. Each seed point belongs to a level and has a specific value, therefore they can be prioritized. The tree structure of microglia is known a priori, so we apply the MST to the prioritized seed points to preserve this feature. Results show that our proposed method is fast and accurate in reconstruction of large images.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590922.pdf","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1211","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590922","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated tracing of microglia using multilevel thresholding and minimum spanning trees","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Dictionaries","Immune system","Vegetation","Animals","Microscopy","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","cellular biophysics","image reconstruction","medical image processing","neurophysiology","optical microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automated microglia tracing","multilevel thresholding","minimum spanning trees","immune cells","central nervous system","morphology","microscopy images","image pixels","prioritized seed points","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Microglia","Microscopy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Automated tracing of microglia using multilevel thresholding and minimum spanning trees","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590922/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395664","pubMedId":"28268542","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated tracing of microglia using multilevel thresholding and minimum spanning trees","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"03391538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067646S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590955,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The challenge remains active in medical image analysis research due to varied distribution of blood vessels, which manifest variations in their dimensions of physical appearance against a noisy background. In this paper we formulate the segmentation challenge as a classification task. Specifically, we employ unsupervised hierarchical feature learning using ensemble of two level of sparsely trained denoised stacked autoencoder. First level training with bootstrap samples ensures decoupling and second level ensemble formed by different network architectures ensures architectural revision. We show that ensemble training of auto-encoders fosters diversity in learning dictionary of visual kernels for vessel segmentation. SoftMax classifier is used for fine tuning each member autoencoder and multiple strategies are explored for 2-level fusion of ensemble members. On DRIVE dataset, we achieve maximum average accuracy of 95.33% with an impressively low standard deviation of 0.003 and Kappa agreement coefficient of 0.708. Comparison with other major algorithms substantiates the high efficacy of our model.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590955","startPage":"1340","endPage":"1343","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590955.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep neural ensemble for retinal vessel segmentation in fundus images towards achieving label-free angiography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590955/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep neural ensemble for retinal vessel segmentation in fundus images towards achieving label-free angiography","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590955/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16395314","pubMedId":"28268573","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep neural ensemble for retinal vessel segmentation in fundus images towards achieving label-free angiography","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"03721810.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061139S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7590959,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, a novel application of deep learning (stacked sparse auto-encoders) is presented for skin lesion classification task. The stacked sparse auto-encoder discovers latent information features in input images (pixel intensities). These high-level features are subsequently fed into a classifier for classifying dermoscopy images. In addition, we proposed a new deep neural network architecture based on bag-of-features (BoF) model, which learns high-level image representation and maps images into BoF space. Then, we examine how using this deep representation of BoF, compared with pixel intensities of images, can improve the classification accuracy. The proposed method is evaluated on a test set of 244 skin images. To test the performance of the proposed method, the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) is utilized. The proposed method is found to achieve 95% accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590962","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590962.pdf","startPage":"1369","endPage":"1372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A deep bag-of-features model for the classification of melanomas in dermoscopy images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7590962","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590962/","displayDocTitle":"A deep bag-of-features model for the classification of melanomas in dermoscopy images","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395073","pubMedId":"28268580","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7590962/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A deep bag-of-features model for the classification of melanomas in dermoscopy images","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"03792183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060911S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590962","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7590963,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In this paper an implementation of a deep-learning system on a computer server, equipped with graphic processing unit (GPU), is proposed for detection of melanoma lesions. Clinical (non-dermoscopic) images are used in the proposed system, which could assist a dermatologist in early diagnosis of this type of skin cancer. In the proposed system, input clinical images, which could contain illumination and noise effects, are preprocessed in order to reduce such artifacts. Afterward, the enhanced images are fed to a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) which is a member of deep learning models. The CNN classifier, which is trained by large number of training samples, distinguishes between melanoma and benign cases. Experimental results show that the proposed method is superior in terms of diagnostic accuracy in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07590963.pdf","startPage":"1373","endPage":"1376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590963","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Melanoma detection by analysis of clinical images using convolutional neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Melanoma detection by analysis of clinical images using convolutional neural network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7590963/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7590963/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395804","pubMedId":"28268581","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Melanoma detection by analysis of clinical images using convolutional neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"03802190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104677S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7590963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7591006,"authors":[{"name":"Trieu Phat Luu","affiliation":["University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Trieu Phat","lastName":"Luu","id":"37604276100"},{"name":"Yongtian He","affiliation":["University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Yongtian","lastName":"He","id":"37085335927"},{"name":"Sho Nakagame","affiliation":["University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Sho","lastName":"Nakagame","id":"37085895891"},{"name":"Jeffrey Gorges","affiliation":["University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Gorges","id":"37085892372"},{"name":"Kevin Nathan","affiliation":["University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Kevin","lastName":"Nathan","id":"37085335997"},{"name":"Jose L.

However, nonlinear relationship between neural activities and limb movements may challenge the linear decoders in real-time brain computer interface (BCI) applications. In this study, we propose a nonlinear neural decoder using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to infer lower limb joint angles from noninvasive scalp EEG signals during human treadmill walking. Our results demonstrate that lower limb joint angles during treadmill walking can be decoded from the fluctuations in the amplitude of slow cortical potentials in the delta band (0.1-3Hz). Overall, the average decoding accuracy were 0.43 \u00b1 0.18 for Pearson's r value and 1.82 \u00b1 3.07 for signal to noise ratio (SNR), and robust to ocular, muscle, or movement artifacts. Moreover, the signal preprocessing scheme and the design of UKF allow the implementation of the proposed EEG-based BCI for real-time applications. This has implications for the development of closed-loop EEG-based BCI systems for gait rehabilitation after stroke.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591006","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591006.pdf","startPage":"1548","endPage":"1551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unscented Kalman filter for neural decoding of human treadmill walking from non-invasive electroencephalography","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591006","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591006/","displayDocTitle":"Unscented Kalman filter for neural decoding of human treadmill walking from non-invasive electroencephalography","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395380","pubMedId":"28268622","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591006/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unscented Kalman filter for neural decoding of human treadmill walking from non-invasive electroencephalography","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"04231948.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081487S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591006","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7591023,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Song","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Song","id":"37333901600"},{"name":"Robert E.

Specifically, identification of spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) from recorded spontaneous in vivo spike timing is a potentially powerful tool to quantify activity-dependent plasticity. In previous work, we presented a methodology to perform this STDP identification from spike timing alone and successfully identified a generative model. Validation was straightforward with the generative model because the underlying model was known, but becomes challenging when applied to experimental data. Here, we introduce a set of null hypothesis tests that can be performed with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of null models to rule out cases of overfitting with experimental data. We demonstrate the identification of these null models and null hypothesis testing on a generative model in two test cases, one with and one without overfitting. Importantly, we show that it is possible to distinguish an identified STDP rule from a null case where there are similar weight fluctuations which are activity-independent. With the development of the null hypothesis tests described here, STDP identification can be effectively applied to experimental data recordings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte Carlo validation of spike-timing-dependent plasticity identification from spiking activity","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591024","endPage":"1627","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591024.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","startPage":"1624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591024","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data models","Adaptation models","Neurons","Timing","Monte Carlo methods","Feedforward neural networks","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical measurement","Monte Carlo methods","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spike-timing-dependent plasticity identification","spiking activity","neural data","null model","activity-dependent plasticity quantification","Monte Carlo simulation","weight fluctuation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Action Potentials","Models, Neurological","Monte Carlo Method","Neuronal Plasticity","Neurons"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Monte Carlo validation of spike-timing-dependent plasticity identification from spiking activity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591024/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591024/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16395369","pubMedId":"28268640","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte Carlo validation of spike-timing-dependent plasticity identification from spiking activity","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"04412240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035668S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7591074,"authors":[{"name":"Mahsa Shoaran","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA"],"firstName":"Mahsa","lastName":"Shoaran","id":"38511392500"},{"name":"Masoud Farivar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Farivar","id":"38233801900"},{"name":"Azita Emami","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA"],"firstName":"Azita","lastName":"Emami","id":"37085378370"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7591074","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":452},"abstract":"Efficient on-chip learning is becoming an essential element of implantable biomedical devices.

Specifically, through proper mechanism design and flight mode transition, the SSSG can imitate the Silver Gull's flight gesture during flapping flight, save power consuming by switching to the fixed wing flight mode during long-range cruising, and hover at targeted area when transferring to quadcopter flight mode. Based on the aerodynamic models, the Simscape, a product of MathWorks, is used to simulate and analyse the performance of the SSSG's flight modes. The entity simulation results indicate that the created SSSG's 3D model is feasible and ready to be manufactured for further flight tests.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The hybrid bio-inspired aerial vehicle: Concept and SIMSCAPE flight simulation","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591144","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591144.pdf","startPage":"2107","endPage":"2110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"The hybrid bio-inspired aerial vehicle: Concept and SIMSCAPE flight simulation","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591144/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16379804","pubMedId":"28268747","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The hybrid bio-inspired aerial vehicle: Concept and SIMSCAPE flight simulation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"05621092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053527S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7591146,"authors":[{"name":"Onder Erin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Onder","lastName":"Erin","id":"37085907037"},{"name":"Nishant Pol","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Nishant","lastName":"Pol","id":"37085898235"},{"name":"Luis Valle","affiliation":["Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Valle","id":"37085904472"},{"name":"Yong-Lae Park","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yong-Lae","lastName":"Park","id":"37600943600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7591146","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":674},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Muscles","Force","Inductance","Actuators","Wires","Optical fiber sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electroactive polymer actuators","force sensors","inductive sensors","pneumatic actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bio-inspired pneumatic artificial muscle","self-contained sensing","self-contained displacement","force sensing","traditional McKibben muscle","coil inductance"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Equipment Design","Models, Biological","Muscle, Skeletal","Robotics"]}],"abstract":"Pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) are one of the most famous linear actuators in bio-inspired robotics. They can generate relatively high linear force considering their form factors and weights. Furthermore, PAMs are inexpensive compared with traditional electromagnetic actuators (e.g. DC motors) and also inherently light and compliant. In robotics applications, however, they typically require external sensing mechanisms due to their nonlinear behaviors, which may make the entire mechanical system bulky and complicated, limiting their use in simple systems. This study presents the design and fabrication of a low-cost McKibben-type PAM with a self-contained displacement and force sensing capability that does not require any external sensing elements. The proposed PAM can detect axial contraction force and displacement at the same time. In this study, the design of a traditional McKibben muscle was modified to include an inductive coil surrounding the muscle fibers. Then, a thin, soft silicone layer was coated outside of the muscle to protect and hold the sensing coil on the actuator. This novel design measures coil inductance change to determine the contraction force and the displacement. The process can be applied to a variety of existing McKibben actuator designs without significantly changing the rigidity of the actuator while minimizing the device's footprint.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a bio-inspired pneumatic artificial muscle with self-contained sensing","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591146","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591146.pdf","startPage":"2115","endPage":"2119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design of a bio-inspired pneumatic artificial muscle with self-contained sensing","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591146/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16394902","pubMedId":"28268749","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a bio-inspired pneumatic artificial muscle with self-contained sensing","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"05642185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056121S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7591147,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This work describes the design of a wearable haptic feedback device for lower limb amputees using lateral skin-stretch modality intended to serve as a feedback cue during ambulation. A feedback scheme was proposed based on gait event detection for possible real-time postural adjustment.

People with hemiplegia can experience reduced arm swing, which can negatively impact the quality of gait. Wearable and wireless sensors, such as through a smartphone, have demonstrated the ability to quantify various features of gait. With a software application the smartphone (iPhone) can function as a wireless gyroscope platform capable of conveying a gyroscope signal recording as an email attachment by wireless connectivity to the Internet. The gyroscope signal recordings of the affected hemiplegic arm with reduced arm swing arm and the unaffected arm are post-processed into a feature set for machine learning. Using a multilayer perceptron neural network a considerable degree of classification accuracy is attained to distinguish between the affected hemiplegic arm with reduced arm swing arm and the unaffected arm.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591269","startPage":"2626","endPage":"2630","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591269.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591269","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of a smartphone as a wireless gyroscope platform for quantifying reduced arm swing in hemiplegie gait with machine learning classification by multilayer perceptron neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gyroscopes","Wireless communication","Wireless sensor networks","Multilayer perceptrons","Biological neural networks","Sensors","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","gait analysis","gyroscopes","Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical signal processing","multilayer perceptrons","neurophysiology","smart phones","telemedicine"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hemiplegic arm","Internet","gyroscope signal recording","wireless sensors","wearable sensors","upper limb","lower limb","rhythmic patterns","synchronous patterns","multilayer perceptron neural network","machine learning classification","hemiplegie gait analysis","reduced arm swing quantification","wireless gyroscope platform","smartphone"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["iPhone","smartphone","wireless gyroscope","arm swing","reduced arm swing","hemiplegic gait","machine learning","feature set","multilayer perceptron neural network"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Arm","Equipment Design","Gait","Hemiplegia","Humans","Internet","Machine Learning","Mobile Applications","Monitoring, Ambulatory","Neural Networks (Computer)","Paresis","Reproducibility of Results","Smartphone"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591269/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of a smartphone as a wireless gyroscope platform for quantifying reduced arm swing in hemiplegie gait with machine learning classification by multilayer perceptron neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591269/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16379875","pubMedId":"28268861","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of a smartphone as a wireless gyroscope platform for quantifying reduced arm swing in hemiplegie gait with machine learning classification by multilayer perceptron neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"06872322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073455S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591269","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7591281,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmadreza Argha","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Ahmadreza","lastName":"Argha","id":"37546748600"},{"name":"Lin Ye","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Ye","id":"37085650370"},{"name":"Steven W.

We employed retrospective data from the publicly available MIMIC II intensive care unit database, and developed a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an optimal heparin dosing policy from sample dosing trails and their associated outcomes in large electronic medical records. Using separate training and testing datasets, our model was observed to be effective in proposing heparin doses that resulted in better expected outcomes than the clinical guidelines.

However, an accurate trade-off between the higher frame rate and image contrast and resolution should be performed. Plane-Wave Imaging (PWI) can potentially achieve frame rates in the order of 10 kHz, as it uses a single unfocused plane wave (and thus a single transmit event) to acquire the image of the entire region of interest. The lack of transmit focusing however causes a significant drop of image quality, which can be restored by coherently compounding several tilted plane-wave frames, at the expense of the frame rate. PWI together with the use of a beamforming algorithm able to achieve a higher image contrast resolution, such as the Delay Multiply And Sum (DMAS), could thus allow to improve image quality achieving a high frame rate at the same time. This paper presents the first simulation results obtained by employing DMAS beamforming and PWI with different transmission angles and coherent compounding. The simulated Point Spread Function (PSF) and cyst-phantom images show that DMAS makes it possible to achieve a high image quality with a reduced number of compounded frames compared to standard Delay And Sum (DAS), and hence it can be used to improve the contrast and resolution of plane-wave images still achieving a very high frame rate.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591415/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16395330","pubMedId":"28268994","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591415/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound plane-wave imaging with delay multiply and sum beamforming and coherent compounding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound plane-wave imaging with delay multiply and sum beamforming and coherent compounding","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"08851237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052793S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591415","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7591417,"authors":[{"name":"Gustavo R.

However, it suffers from sensitivity to speed of sound errors and aberration. Although there have been several studies on the application of phase aberration correction (PAC) methods to conventional delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming, the benefits of PAC methods in mitigating the effects of phase aberration in MV beamformed images are not well understood. A study of this type would be helpful in designing a robust beamformer based on PAC knowledge present in the literature. This study analyzes three PAC algorithms (multi-lag cross-correlation, Rigby's beamsum and scaled covariance matrix) and their impact on the performance of the MV beamformer in the presence of second order phase aberrations. The PAC methods in combination with the MV beamformer were tested on simulated and experimental data corrupted with an electronically created near field phase aberrator. It is shown that all gains in performance of the MV beamformer with respect to DAS is lost at high aberration strengths. For instance, at 60 ns of aberration the lateral resolution of DAS degrades by 22% while MV degrades by 600%. It is also shown that basic PAC methods improve the aberrated MV beamformer. PAC methods reduces degradation in lateral resolution from 600% to 5%. Similar improvements are observed in peak sidelobe level (96% to 27%), contrast (88% to 49% for the simulations and 43% to 15% for experiments) and contrast-to-noise ratio (86% to 42% for the simulations and 68% to 55% for experiments). These enhancements allow the MV beamformer to outperform DAS even in the strongest aberration case.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591417/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16394922","pubMedId":"28268996","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591417/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Effects of phase aberration correction methods on the minimum variance beamformer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of phase aberration correction methods on the minimum variance beamformer","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"08871762.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051639S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7591423,"authors":[{"name":"Sohini Roychowdhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Both-ell, WA"],"firstName":"Sohini","lastName":"Roychowdhury","id":"38580454400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7591423","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":337},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Biomedical imaging","Lesions","Blood vessels","Pathology","Retina","Data mining"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical optical imaging","blood vessels","cloud computing","data mining","decision trees","diseases","eye","feature extraction","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fundus image dataset classification","cloud computing","medical image dataset","data creation","data processing","generalized method","diabetic retinopathy detection","region-based feature","pixel-based feature","feature extraction","blood vessel-like structure","feature ranking strategy","blood vessel classification accuracy","boosted decision tree","decision forest classifier","microsoft azure machine learning studio","DIARETDB1 dataset","red lesion region","hemorrhage","microaneurysms","STARE dataset","cloud-based fundus image analysis system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["data mining","feature reduction","Microsoft Azure"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Cloud Computing","Databases as Topic","Diabetic Retinopathy","Female","Fundus Oculi","Humans","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","ROC Curve","Reproducibility of Results"]}],"abstract":"Large medical image data sets with high dimensionality require substantial amount of computation time for data creation and data processing. This paper presents a novel generalized method that finds optimal image-based feature sets that reduce computational time complexity while maximizing overall classification accuracy for detection of diabetic retinopathy (DR). First, region-based and pixel-based features are extracted from fundus images for classification of DR lesions and vessel-like structures. Next, feature ranking strategies are used to distinguish the optimal classification feature sets. DR lesion and vessel classification accuracies are computed using the boosted decision tree and decision forest classifiers in the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio platform, respectively. For images from the DIARETDB1 data set, 40 of its highest-ranked features are used to classify four DR lesion types with an average classification accuracy of 90.1% in 792 seconds. Also, for classification of red lesion regions and hemorrhages from microaneurysms, accuracies of 85% and 72% are observed, respectively. For images from STARE data set, 40 high-ranked features can classify minor blood vessels with an accuracy of 83.5% in 326 seconds. Such cloud-based fundus image analysis systems can significantly enhance the borderline classification performances in automated screening systems.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591423","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591423.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","startPage":"3256","endPage":"3259","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of large-scale fundus image data sets: A cloud-computing framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Classification of large-scale fundus image data sets: A cloud-computing framework","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591423/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395071","pubMedId":"28269002","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7591423/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of large-scale fundus image data sets: A cloud-computing framework","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"08930298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041651S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7591445,"authors":[{"name":"Gregory M Noetscher","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Eng.

In this article we propose convolutive blind source separation (BSS) as an effective tool to pre-process surface electromyogram (sEMG) data of the human respiratory muscles. Specifically, the problem of discriminating between inspiratory, expiratory and cardiac muscle activity is addressed, which currently poses a major obstacle for the clinical use of sEMG for adaptive ventilation control. It is shown that using the investigated broadband algorithm, a clear separation of these components can be achieved. The algorithm is based on a generic framework for BSS that utilizes multiple statistical signal characteristics.

The developed method incorporates the coherence between the speech and noise signals to obtain a SE gain function which is used in conjunction with the gain function obtained by Spectral Subtraction using adaptive gain averaging. SE using coherence based gain function is found to suppress the background noise well, while inducing speech distortion. On the other hand, SE using Spectral Subtraction improves speech quality with tolerable speech distortion, but introduces background musical noise for certain noise types. The weighted fusion of the two gain functions strikes a balance between noise suppression and speech distortion. Also it allows the user to control the weighting factor based on the noisy environment and their comfort level of hearing. The developed method is computationally fast and operates in real-time. The proposed method was evaluated for machinery, babble, and car noise types, using both objective and subjective measures for both quality and intelligibility of the enhanced speech. The results show significant improvements in comparison with stand-alone Spectral Subtraction with weighted gain averaging SE methods.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Noise measurement","Speech enhancement","Microphones","Coherence","Music","Auditory system"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hearing aids","medical signal processing","microphones","smart phones","spectral analysis","speech enhancement","speech intelligibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microphone spectral-coherence based speech enhancement","hearing aids","smartphone","assistive device","speech enhancement technique","HA","speech signals","noise signals","SE gain function","adaptive gain averaging","coherence based gain function","background noise","speech quality","tolerable speech distortion","background musical noise","weighted fusion","noise suppression","weighting factor","noisy environment","comfort hearing level","machinery noise","babble noise","car noise","speech intelligibility","stand-alone spectral subtraction","weighted gain averaging SE method"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Communication Aids for Disabled","Hearing","Hearing Aids","Humans","Noise","Smartphone","Speech Intelligibility"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591524","startPage":"3670","endPage":"3673","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591524.pdf","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two microphones spectral-coherence based speech enhancement for hearing aids using smartphone as an assistive device","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Two microphones spectral-coherence based speech enhancement for hearing aids using smartphone as an assistive device","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16379812","pubMedId":"28269090","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7591524/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two microphones spectral-coherence based speech enhancement for hearing aids using smartphone as an assistive device","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"10121170.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042419S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7591531,"authors":[{"name":"Jeevan K.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed technique yields upto 0.76dB improvement in the reconstruction performance for foot-gait signals relative to the algorithms promoting block-sparse structure.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591531","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591531.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","startPage":"3700","endPage":"3703","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing of foot-gait signals by enhancing group block-sparse structure on the first-order difference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing of foot-gait signals by enhancing group block-sparse structure on the first-order difference","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591531/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395395","pubMedId":"28269095","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7591531/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing of foot-gait signals by enhancing group block-sparse structure on the first-order difference","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"10190282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066386S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7591542,"authors":[{"name":"Sezer Ulukaya","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul, Turkey and Trakya University, Edirne, Turkey"],"firstName":"Sezer","lastName":"Ulukaya","id":"37712665700"},{"name":"Gorkem Serbes","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Gorkem","lastName":"Serbes","id":"37590486300"},{"name":"Ipek Sen","affiliation":["Electrosalus Inc., Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ipek","lastName":"Sen","id":"37605716900"},{"name":"Yasemin P.

However, the dyadic-DWT has poor frequency resolution due to the low-oscillatory nature of its wavelet bases and therefore, it is less effective in processing embolic signals (ESs). To process ESs more effectively, a wavelet transform having better frequency resolution than the dyadic-DWT is needed. Therefore, in this study two ESs, containing micro-emboli and artifact waveforms, are analyzed with the Directional Dual Tree Rational-Dilation Wavelet Transform (DDT-RADWT). The DDT-RADWT, which can be directly applied to quadrature signals, is based on rational dilation factors and has adjustable frequency resolution. The analyses are done for both low and high Q-factors. It is proved that, when high Q-factor filters are employed in the DDT-RADWT, clearer representations of ESs can be attained in decomposed sub-bands and artifacts can be successfully separated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of embolic signals with directional dual tree rational dilation wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591561","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591561.pdf","startPage":"3821","endPage":"3824","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591561","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of embolic signals with directional dual tree rational dilation wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591561/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16394890","pubMedId":"28269119","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of embolic signals with directional dual tree rational dilation wavelet transform","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"10492039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060578S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7591565,"authors":[{"name":"Mehrdad Heydarzadeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Heydarzadeh","id":"37085658281"},{"name":"Mehrdad Nourani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas"],"firstName":"Mehrdad","lastName":"Nourani","id":"37273839500"},{"name":"Sarah Ostadabbas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University"],"firstName":"Sarah","lastName":"Ostadabbas","id":"37541322000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7591565","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":407},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Computer architecture","Monitoring","Feature extraction","Hospitals","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","image classification","mechanoception","medical image processing","patient monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-bed posture classification","deep autoencoder","bed-bound patients","health-care system","automatic posture detection","pressure ulcer monitoring","pressure mapping system","feature extraction","histogram-of-gradient","pressure image"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Beds","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Monitoring, Physiologic","Neural Networks (Computer)","Posture","Pressure Ulcer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591565","abstract":"Pressure ulcers are high prevalence complications among bed-bound patients which are not only extremely painful and difficult to treat, but also impose a great burden in our health-care system.

A lot of progress has been made in the development of molecular based assays, but many of the cases still require the careful analysis of the stained tissue under a bright-field microscope and its analysis. This procedure is costly and time-consuming. We present a novel method for classification of cancer cells in lymph node images. It is based on the measurement of the spectral image of hematoxylin and eosin stained sample under the microscope and the analysis of the acquired data using state of the art machine learning techniques. The method is based on the analysis of the spectral information of the cells as well as their morphological properties. A large number of descriptors is extracted for each cell location, which are used to train a supervised classifier which discriminates between normal and cancer cells. We show that a reliable analysis can be made with detection rate (recall) of 81%-100% for the cancer class.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591597","startPage":"3973","endPage":"3976","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591597.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic classification of cancer cells in multispectral microscopic images of lymph node samples","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Automatic classification of cancer cells in multispectral microscopic images of lymph node samples","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591597/","accessionNumber":"16379789","pubMedId":"28269155","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591597/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic classification of cancer cells in multispectral microscopic images of lymph node samples","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"10850576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05126S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591597","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7591712,"authors":[{"name":"P.

While the results of previous studies have shown promise, a NMI which takes advantage of early movement-related EEG activity preceding movement onset, as well as the improved signal-to-noise ratio of EMG, could prove to be more accurate and responsive than current NMI designs based solely on EEG or EMG. Previous studies have demonstrated that the activity of the sensorimotor cortex is coupled to the firing rate of motor units in lower limb muscles during voluntary contraction. However, the exploration of corticomuscular coherence during locomotive tasks has been limited. In this study, coupling between the motor cortex and right tibialis anterior muscle activity was preliminarily investigated during self-paced over-ground walking and ramp ascent. EEG at the motor cortex and surface EMG from the tibialis anterior were collected from one able-bodied subject. Coherence between the two signals was computed and studied across gait cycles. The EEG activity led the EMG activity in the low gamma band in swing phase of level ground walking and in stance phase of ramp ascent. These results may inform the future design of EEG-EMG multimodal NMIs for lower limb devices that assist locomotion of people with physical disabilities.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591760","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591760","startPage":"4634","endPage":"4637","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591760.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Corticomuscular coherence variation throughout the gait cycle during overground walking and ramp ascent: A preliminary investigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Corticomuscular coherence variation throughout the gait cycle during overground walking and ramp ascent: A preliminary investigation","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591760/","accessionNumber":"16379811","pubMedId":"28269308","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591760/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Corticomuscular coherence variation throughout the gait cycle during overground walking and ramp ascent: A preliminary investigation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"12481960.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063871S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7591765,"authors":[{"name":"Rifai Chai","affiliation":["Centre for Health Technologies, University of Technology, Sydney (UTS), NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Rifai","lastName":"Chai","id":"38467189500"},{"name":"Yvonne Tran","affiliation":["Centre for Health Technologies University of Technology, University of Sydney, Sydney"],"firstName":"Yvonne","lastName":"Tran","id":"37599973100"},{"name":"Ganesh R.

For the computational intelligence, the system uses the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) as the dimension reduction method of the original 26 channels of EEG data, power spectral density (PSD) as feature extractor and Bayesian neural network (BNN) as classifier. After applying the PCA, the dimension of the data is reduced from 26 EEG channels in 6 principal components (PCs) with above 90% of information retained. Based on this reduced dimension of 6 PCs of data, during eyes open, the classification pre-task (alert) vs. post-task (fatigue) using Bayesian neural network resulted in sensitivity of 76.8 %, specificity of 75.1% and accuracy of 76% Also based on data from the 6 PCs, during eye closed, the classification between pre- and post-task resulted in a sensitivity of 76.1%, specificity of 74.5% and accuracy of 75.3%. Further, the classification results of using only 6 PCs data are comparable to the result using the original 26 EEG channels.

Two features, namely, sum of absolute differences (SAD) and maximum of absolute differences (MAD) are efficiently computed for each ECG segment in the bio-sensor. The computed features can be transmitted from the bio-sensor using wireless channel, and they can be used in the receiver for determining the absence of QRS complex in the segment. By avoiding computationally expensive signal reconstruction for the ECG segments without QRS complex, it is shown, using simulation results, that computation time can be reduced by approximately 7.4% for long-term telemonitoring of QRS-based arrhythmia. Detection of the absence of QRS complex can be carried out in around 7 milliseconds in a standard laptop computer with 2.2GHz processor and 8GB RAM.","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591784","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07591784.pdf","startPage":"4731","endPage":"4734","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient compressive sensing of ECG segments based on machine learning for QRS-based arrhythmia detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7591784","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7591784/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient compressive sensing of ECG segments based on machine learning for QRS-based arrhythmia detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395971","pubMedId":"28269328","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7591784/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient compressive sensing of ECG segments based on machine learning for QRS-based arrhythmia detection","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"12720278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046493S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7591784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7591811,"authors":[{"name":"Callum Laurenson","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Australia"],"firstName":"Callum","lastName":"Laurenson","id":"37085488275"},{"name":"Francois Rivet","affiliation":["University of Bordeaux and IMS Laboratory, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Rivet","id":"37403070000"},{"name":"Mehmet R.

Development of the algorithm is based on the shank angular velocity in the sagittal plane and linear acceleration signal in the shank longitudinal direction. System performance was evaluated with four control subjects (CS) and one transfemoral amputee (TFA) and the results were validated with four FlexiForce footswitches (FSW). The results showed a data latency for initial contact (IC) and toe off (TO) within a range of \u00b1 40 ms for both CS and TFA. A delay of about 3.7 \u00b1 62 ms for a foot-flat start (FFS) and an early detection of -9.4 \u00b1 66 ms for heel-off (HO) was found for CS. Prosthetic side showed an early detection of -105 \u00b1 95 ms for FFS whereas intact side showed a delay of 141 \u00b173 ms for HO. The difference in the kinematics of the TFA and CS is one of the potential reasons for high variations in the time difference. Overall, detection accuracy was 99.78% for all the events in both groups. Based on the validated results, the proposed system can be used to accurately detect the temporal gait events in real-time that leads to the detection of gait phase system and therefore, can be utilized in gait analysis applications and the control of lower limb prostheses.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Prosthetics","Radiation detectors","Real-time

tested a novel adaptive controller for powered transfemoral prostheses. Adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) was implemented within the prosthesis control to complement the existing finite state impedance control (FS-IC) in a prototypic active-transfemoral prosthesis (ATP). The ADP controller interacts with the human user-prosthesis system, observes the prosthesis user's dynamic states during walking, and learns to personalize user performance properties via online adaptation to meet the individual user's objectives. The new ADP controller was preliminarily tested on one able-bodied subject walking on a treadmill. The test objective was for the user to approach normative knee kinematics by tuning the FS-IC impedance parameters via ADP. The results showed the ADP was able to adjust the prosthesis controller to generate the desired normative knee kinematics within 10 minutes. In the meantime, the FS-IC impedance parameters converged at the end of the adaptive tuning procedure while maintaining the desired human-prosthesis performance. This study demonstrated the feasibility of ADP for adaptive control of a powered lower limb prosthesis. Future research efforts will address several important issues in order to validate the system on amputees.

Accordingly, a large effort is being made to extend and integrate this adaptability to lower-limb prostheses. To date, the main focus of this research has been on short term adaptation, such as in response to a terrain transition or a sudden change in the environment. However, long term adaptation and underlying sensorimotor learning processes are critical to optimizing walking patterns and predictively changing our gait when faced with continued perturbations. Furthermore, investigating these processes in lower-limb amputees may provide a unique window into the interplay between sensory driven adaptation and top-down cerebellar modulation of locomotor reflexes and may potentially help alleviate gait asymmetries. In the current exploratory study, we therefore investigated adaptation, sensorimotor learning, and gait symmetry in a group of transtibial amputees walking with a hybrid-EMG controlled powered prosthesis and matched controls (both groups N=3). Participants were asked to perform a split-belt walking trial during which the belt on the affected side ran at twice the speed of the contralateral belt (1.0m/s and 0.5m/s respectively). Adaptation, sensorimotor learning, and symmetry are compared to two baseline conditions. Initial results illustrate that the amputees were readily able to use the hybrid controller, modulated their EMG depending on treadmill speed, and successfully adapted their gait during split-belt walking. However, the temporal gait parameters suggest that amputees used a different adaptation technique and showed reduced sensorimotor learning, while gait symmetry was improved, in the short term, post-adaptation.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromyography","Legged locomotion","Muscles","Prosthetics","Belts","Torque","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled

To mitigate these issues, cognitive radio (CR) or opportunistic radio network enabled wireless technology is suitable for the upcoming wireless healthcare system. The up-to-date research on CR based healthcare has exposed some developments on EMI and spectrum problems. However, the investigation recommendation on system design and network model for CR enabled hospital is rare. Thus, this research designs a hierarchy based hybrid network architecture and network maintenance protocols for previously proposed CR hospital system, known as CogMed. In the previous study, the detail architecture of CogMed and its maintenance protocols were not present. The proposed architecture includes clustering concepts for cognitive base stations and non-medical devices. Two cluster head (CH selector equations are formulated based on priority of location, device, mobility rate of devices and number of accessible channels. In order to maintain the integrity of the proposed network model, node joining and node leaving protocols are also proposed. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed network maintenance time is very low for emergency medical devices (average maintenance period 9.5 ms) and the re-clustering effects for different mobility enabled non-medical devices are also balanced.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592092/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16395855","pubMedId":"28269616","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7592092/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cluster based architecture and network maintenance protocol for medical priority aware cognitive radio based hospital","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster based architecture and network maintenance protocol for medical priority aware cognitive radio based hospital","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"16351291.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048326S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7592092","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7592172,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Practical system deployments also require adequate rejection of common-mode interference, such as that due to line power noise or muscle artifacts, and supply noise.

Based on the natural similarity between gestures of the lower leg and the arm and on established methods in electromyography-based gesture classification, we propose a noninvasive system with which users control an upper limb prosthesis via homologous movements of the leg and foot. Eight inexperienced able-bodied subjects controlled a simulated robotic arm in a target achievement control (TAC) task with command of up to four degrees of freedom toward targets requiring one motion class. All subjects performed the task with analogous electromyography recording configurations on both the leg and the arm (as a benchmark), achieving slightly better performance with leg control overall. Only a brief demonstration of the arm-leg gesture mapping was necessary for subjects to perform the task, establishing the minimal training time required to begin using the control scheme. Our findings indicate that electromyography-based recognition of leg gestures may be a viable noninvasive prosthesis control option for high-level amputees.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7590615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EMBC.2016.7592184","publicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7580725/7590615/07592184.pdf","startPage":"6365","endPage":"6368","doi":"10.1109/EMBC.2016.7592184","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time evaluation of a myoelectric control method for high-level upper limb amputees based on homologous leg movements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Real-time evaluation of a myoelectric control method for high-level upper limb amputees based on homologous leg movements","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7592184/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16395626","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","pubMedId":"28269705","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592184/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time evaluation of a myoelectric control method for high-level upper limb amputees based on homologous leg movements","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"22900961.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064227S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7592184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7592193,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Such prostheses often have pre-programmed modes which can allow activities such as climbing stairs and descending ramps, something which many amputees struggle with when using non-powered limbs. Previous literature has shown how pattern classification can allow seamless transitions between modes with a high accuracy and without any user interaction. Although accurate, training and testing each subject with their own dependent data is time consuming. By using subject independent datasets, whereby a unique subject is tested against a pooled dataset of other subjects, we believe subject training time can be reduced while still achieving an accurate classification. We present here an intent recognition system using an artificial neural network (ANN) with a scaled conjugate gradient learning algorithm to classify gait intention with user-dependent and independent datasets for six unilateral lower limb amputees. We compare these results against a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. The ANN was found to have significantly lower classification error (P<;0.05) than LDA with all user-dependent step-types, as well as transitional steps for user-independent datasets. Both types of classifiers are capable of making fast decisions; 1.29 and 2.83 ms for the LDA and ANN respectively. These results suggest that ANNs can provide suitable and accurate offline classification in prosthesis gait prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592194/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16395011","pubMedId":"28325033","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7592194/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"User intent prediction with a scaled conjugate gradient trained artificial neural network for lower limb amputees using a powered prosthesis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User intent prediction with a scaled conjugate gradient trained artificial neural network for lower limb amputees using a powered prosthesis","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"23001857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066893S","chronDate":"16-20 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7580725","isNumber":"7590615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7580725","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7590615","articleId":"7592194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7592213,"authors":[{"name":"Jens Muehlsteff","affiliation":["Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Muehlsteff","id":"37590529000"},{"name":"Erik Bresch","affiliation":["Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Bresch","id":"38093590800"},{"name":"Lars Schmitt","affiliation":["Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Schmitt","id":"37269274800"},{"name":"Jos Gelissen","affiliation":["Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jos","lastName":"Gelissen","id":"37085879667"},{"name":"Peter Bingley","affiliation":["Philips Research Europe, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Bingley","id":"37085878184"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0220-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0219-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4615"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"7592213","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"abstract":"Carotid - femoral pulse wave velocity is an established measure to assess cardiovascular risk and an interesting surrogate parameter towards non-invasive continuous blood pressure inference.

The fragmented network view that is widespread in current networks will not stand the challenge posed by next generations of users. A new vision is required, and this paper provides an insight on how network convergence and application-centric approaches will play a leading role toward enabling the 5G vision. This paper, after expressing the view on the need for an end-to-end approach to network design, brings the reader into a journey on the expected 5G network requirements and outlines some of the work currently carried out by main standardisation bodies. It then proposes the use of the concept of network convergence for providing the overall architectural framework to bring together all the different technologies within a unifying and coherent network ecosystem. The novel interpretation of multidimensional convergence we introduce leads us to the exploration of aspects of node consolidation and converged network architectures, delving into details of optical-wireless integration and future convergence of optical data centre and access-metro networks. We then discuss how ownership models enabling network sharing will be instrumental in realising the 5G vision. This paper concludes with final remarks on the role SDN will play in 5G and on the need for new business models that reflect the application-centric view of the network. Finally, we provide some insight on growing research areas in 5G networking.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2016.2617896","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7869456/07592399.pdf","startPage":"535","endPage":"549","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2016.2617896","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Convergence in Future 5G Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592399/","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Convergence in Future 5G Networks","volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"1 Feb.1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16721632","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7592399/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001602","fundingName":"Science Foundation Ireland","grantNumber":"14/IA/2527 and 13/RC/2077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Multidimensional Convergence in Future 5G Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-ruffini-2617896-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108635S","chronDate":"Feb.1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7869456","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7869456","articleId":"7592399","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7592406,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzhangzhi Guo","affiliation":["ModiFace Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8244326/7592406/guo-2614653-small.gif","p":["Wenzhangzhi Guo (S\u201909\u2013M\u201914\u2013GS\u201914\u2013M\u201916) received the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2016, and the B.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2014.","She is currently the Director of the Research and Development Department with ModiFace, Toronto, ON, Canada.

We present here the last enhanced version of a bio-inspired reinforcement-learning (RL) modular architecture able to perform skill-to-skill knowledge transfer and called transfer expert RL (TERL) model. TERL architecture is based on a RL actor-critic model where both actor and critic have a hierarchical structure, inspired by the mixture-of-experts model, formed by a gating network that selects experts specializing in learning the policies or value functions of different tasks. A key feature of TERL is the capacity of its gating networks to accumulate, in parallel, evidence on the capacity of experts to solve the new tasks so as to increase the responsibility for action of the best ones. A second key feature is the use of two different responsibility signals for the experts' functioning and learning: this allows the training of multiple experts for each task so that some of them can be later recruited to solve new tasks and avoid catastrophic interference. The utility of TERL mechanisms is shown with tests involving two simulated dynamic robot arms engaged in solving reaching tasks, in particular a planar 2-DoF arm, and a 3-D 4-DoF arm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592409/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2019","volume":"11","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"18756888","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2019","publicationDate":"June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7592409/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Reinforcement Learning Architecture That Transfers Knowledge Between Skills When Solving Multiple Tasks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"FP7/2007\u20132013"},{"fundingName":"ICT Challenge 2 \u201cCognitive Systems and Robotics\u201d through the Project \u201cIM-CLeVeR\u2014Intrinsically Motivated Cumulative Learning Versatile Robots\u201d","grantNumber":"ICT-IP-231722"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Reinforcement Learning Architecture That Transfers Knowledge Between Skills When Solving Multiple Tasks","sourcePdf":"tcds-baldassarre-2607018-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160198S","chronDate":"June  2019","xplore-pub-id":"7274989","isNumber":"8733947","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7274989","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8733947","articleId":"7592409","onlineDate":"14 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7592413,"authors":[{"name":"Heinz Haderer","affiliation":["Institute for Communications and Information Engineering, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/7777000/7592413/hader-2613530-small.gif","p":["Heinz Haderer (GS\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the Dipl.-Ing. degree in telecommunications from the Technical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, in 2010 and 2012, respectively.","In 2012, he joined the Institute for Communications Engineering and RF-Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria, as a Research Assistant.

Furthermore, we summarize the theoretical limitations of LCZ/ZCZ sequence sets and provide examples with regard to the chosen scenario. We present measurements carried out with a software-defined radar platform, which is equipped with 16 MIMO channels operating at a frequency of 77 GHz. We investigated the behavior of the sequence sets on real hardware in the range, cross-range, and range-Doppler domains.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2613530","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7777000/07592413.pdf","startPage":"4312","endPage":"4323","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2613530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Phase-Coded CW MIMO Radar Using Zero- and Low-Correlation-Zone Sequence Sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592413/","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Phase-Coded CW MIMO Radar Using Zero- and Low-Correlation-Zone Sequence Sets","volume":"64","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519051","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7592413/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Austrian COMET-K2 Programme of the Linz Center of Mechatronics"},{"fundingName":"Austrian Federal Government"},{"fundingName":"federal state of Upper Austria"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-Wave Phase-Coded CW MIMO Radar Using Zero- and Low-Correlation-Zone Sequence Sets","sourcePdf":"tmtt-haderer-2613530-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083851S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7777000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7777000","articleId":"7592413","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7592414,"authors":[{"name":"Tong Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7951114/7592414/wang-2617886-small.gif","p":["Tong Wang (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the B.S.\n and\u00a0\u00a0Ph.D. degrees from North China Electric Power University, China, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.

A polytopic control guarantees requisite damping when the current operating point lies inside it. Multiple polytopes increase the robustness of the control provided the polytope inside which the operating point lies after a disturbance is correctly identified. In this paper, the identification of the correct polytope is performed using Kalman-filters and the mean-chi square variable. A 29-machine 127-bus model of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system is used as the test system for this analysis. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive control is able to provide adequate damping to the interarea modes of oscillation under changing operating conditions without any prior knowledge of the postdisturbance operating state. It is also found to be more robust than some of the modern controllers proposed previously.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2617886","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2617886","startPage":"2509","endPage":"2520","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7951114/07592414.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Use of Polytopic Convexity in Developing an Adaptive Interarea Oscillation Damping Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Use of Polytopic Convexity in Developing an Adaptive Interarea Oscillation Damping Scheme","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","volume":"32","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7592414/","accessionNumber":"16969933","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592414/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407071"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2016MS12"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of Polytopic Convexity in Developing an Adaptive Interarea Oscillation Damping Scheme","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wang-2617886-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085637S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7951114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7951114","articleId":"7592414","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7592415,"authors":[{"name":"Shlomo E.

A hybrid approach is proposed merging the generative mixture of Gaussians (MoG) model and the discriminative deep neural network (DNN). The proposed algorithm is executed in two phases, the training phase, which does not recur, and the test phase. First, the noise-free speech log-power spectral density is modeled as an MoG, representing the phoneme-based diversity in the speech signal. A DNN is then trained with phoneme labeled database of clean speech signals for phoneme classification with mel-frequency cepstral coefficients as the input features. In the test phase, a noisy utterance of an untrained speech is processed. Given the phoneme classification results of the noisy speech utterance, a speech presence probability (SPP) is obtained using both the generative and discriminative models. SPP-controlled attenuation is then applied to the noisy speech while simultaneously, the noise estimate is updated. The discriminative DNN maintains the continuity of the speech and the generative phoneme-based MoG preserves the speech spectral structure. Extensive experimental study using real speech and noise signals is provided. We also compare the proposed algorithm with alternative speech enhancement algorithms. We show that we obtain a significant improvement over previous methods in terms of speech quality measures. Finally, we analyze the contribution of all components of the proposed algorithm indicating their combined importance.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2016.2618007","startPage":"2516","endPage":"2530","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7571201/07592415.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2016.2618007","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7571201","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Approach for Speech Enhancement Using MoG Model and Neural Network Phoneme Classifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech enhancement","Noise","Neural networks","Attenuation","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","mixture models","neural nets","speech enhancement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network phoneme classifier","single-microphone speech enhancement algorithm","generative mixture-of-Gaussian model","discriminative deep neural network","training phase","noise-free speech log-power spectral density","phoneme-based diversity","speech signal","phoneme labeled database","mel-frequency cepstral coefficients","noisy speech utterance","speech presence probability","discriminative model","SPP-controlled attenuation","discriminative DNN","generative phoneme-based MoG model","speech spectral structure","speech enhancement algorithm","speech quality measures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MixMax model","neural-network","phoneme classification","speech enhancement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Approach for Speech Enhancement Using MoG Model and Neural Network Phoneme Classifier","volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7592415/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"04 November 2016","accessionNumber":"16422206","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Approach for Speech Enhancement Using MoG Model and Neural Network Phoneme Classifier","sourcePdf":"taslp-gannot-2618007-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104042S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7571201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7571201","articleId":"7592415","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7592418,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoqing Lu","affiliation":["School of Engineering, RMIT University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7592418/lu-2618120-small.gif","p":["Xiaoqing Lu received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in applied mathematics from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China.

A finite time frequency regulation strategy containing a consensus-based distributed active power regulator is presented, which can not only guarantee the active power sharing but also enable all DGs' frequencies to converge to the reference value within a finite time. This enables the frequency and voltage control designs to be separated. Then an observer-based distributed voltage regulator involving certain reactive power sharing constraints is proposed, which allows different set points for different DGs and, thus, accounts for the line impedance effects. The steady-state performance analysis shows that the voltage regulator can accurately address the issue of global voltage regulation and accurate reactive power sharing. Moreover, all the distributed controllers are equipped with bounded control inputs to suppress the transient overshoot, and they are implemented through sparse communication networks. The effectiveness of the control in case of load variation, plug-and-play capability, communication topology change, link failure, time delays, and data drop-out are verified by the simulation of an islanded MG in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2618120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2618120","startPage":"2726","endPage":"2740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07592418.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Distributed Secondary Coordination Control Approach for Islanded Microgrids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Distributed Secondary Coordination Control Approach for Islanded Microgrids","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17857441","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7592418/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61403133, 61532020 and 61573134"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australia Research Council","grantNumber":"140100544"},{"fundingName":"International Post-Doctoral Foundation","grantNumber":"20140034"},{"fundingName":"National Post-Doctoral Program for Innovative Talents of China","grantNumber":"BX201600055"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013M540627"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004735","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province","grantNumber":"14JJ3051"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002338","fundingName":"Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20130161120016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Distributed Secondary Coordination Control Approach for Islanded Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tsg-lu-2618120-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155887S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7592418","onlineDate":"14 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7592421,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Ding","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment, Department of Electrical Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"p":["Tao Ding (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S.E.E. and\n M.S.E.E. degrees from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from\n Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2015.

Typically, the dispatching optimization objective is to identify critical PV inverters that have the most significant impact on the network voltage level. Following, it ensures the optimal set-points of both active power and reactive power for the selected inverters, guaranteeing the entire system operating constraints (e.g., the network voltage magnitude) within reasonable ranges. However, the intermittent nature of solar PV energy may affect the selection of the critical PV inverters and also the final optimal objective value. In order to address this issue, a two-stage robust centralized-optimal dispatch model is proposed in this paper to achieve a robust PV inverter dispatch solution considering the PV output uncertainties. In addition, the conic relaxation-based branch flow formulation and the column-and-constraint generation algorithm are employed to deal with the proposed robust optimization model. Case studies on a 33-bus distribution network and comparisons with the deterministic optimization approach have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TSTE.2016.2605926","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165391/7882730/07592421.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7882730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSTE.2016.2605926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Two-Stage Robust Optimization for Centralized-Optimal Dispatch of Photovoltaic Inverters in Active Distribution Networks","volume":"8","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7592421/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16759562","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592421/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51607137"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M580847"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Basis Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2016JQ5015"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002412","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Electrical Insulation and Power Equipment in Xi'an Jiaotong University","grantNumber":"EIPE16301"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2016YFB0901904"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Two-Stage Robust Optimization for Centralized-Optimal Dispatch of Photovoltaic Inverters in Active Distribution Networks","sourcePdf":"tste-ding-2605926-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083175S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165391","isNumber":"7882730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165391","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"7882730","articleId":"7592421","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7592422,"authors":[{"name":"Zhutian Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7981437/7592422/yang-2617874-small.gif","p":["Zhutian Yang (M\u201913) received the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees in\n information and communication engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China in 2008 and 2013,\n respectively.","He is currently a Lecturer in HIT.

Instead of the expected number of successful spectrum access attempts per time slot as a design criterion in current literature, we use the average channel capacity as the achievable throughput to jointly optimize energy harvesting and spectrum sensing subject to the constraints on the energy causality, collision, and temporal correlation of probability of sensing the idle/occupied channel, thus achieving or almost achieving both the energy efficiency and the spectrum efficiency in certain conditions. In addition, the corresponding optimum detection threshold and the maximum achievable throughput are obtained, which are substantiated by our comprehensive computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2616353","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07592423.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2616353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"7212","endPage":"7222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimization of Energy Harvesting and Detection Threshold for Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592423","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimization of Energy Harvesting and Detection Threshold for Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592423/","volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7592423/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16470588","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271421, 61301150 and 61571401"},{"fundingName":"NSERC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Optimization of Energy Harvesting and Detection Threshold for Energy Harvesting Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2616353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082816S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7592423","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7592427,"authors":[{"name":"Eyy\u00fcp \u00d6ks\u00fcztepe","affiliation":["School of Avionics, University of F\u0131rat, Elaz\u0131\u011f, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7951139/7592427/oksuz-2618119-small.gif","p":["Eyy\u00fcp \u00d6ks\u00fcztepe received the B.S. degree\n in electric education from Marmara University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 1995, and the M.S. degree in power systems and the\n Ph.D. degree in electric machinery from F\u0131rat University, Elaz\u0131\u011f, Turkey, in 1999 and 2008,\n respectively.","He was an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering, Tunceli University, Tunceli, Turkey, in\n 2009\u20132015.

The performance of the IW-SRM varies by the dimension parameters of the motor. Estimation of optimum motor dimensions is a multiobjective optimization problem. In dimension optimization of the IW-SRM for direct-driven EVs, torque, torque per motor lamination volume, and efficiency are specified as objective functions. The PMODEA is proposed for the solution of the multiobjective optimization problem as designing IW-SRM, and nondominant optimum solution set consisting of motor dimensions is obtained. This study provides flexibility to the decision maker, in selection of desired one from the existing solution set. The analysis of the selected motor is realized by considering optimum dimensions via the finite-element method (FEM). Then, the IW-SRM is manufactured, and then, the experimental results are obtained for static and dynamic analysis. FEM analysis results are compared with the experimental results. Eventually, it is observed that the results are satisfactory.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7951139/07592427.pdf","startPage":"4706","endPage":"4715","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2618119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2618119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951139","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592427","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-Wheel Switched Reluctance Motor Design for Electric Vehicles by Using a Pareto-Based Multiobjective Differential Evolution Algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Torque","Optimization","Linear programming","Vehicles","Rotors","Stators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric vehicles","evolutionary computation","finite element analysis","laminations","Pareto optimisation","reluctance motor drives","torque motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-wheel switched reluctance motor design","IW-SRM","electric vehicles","Pareto-based multiobjective differential evolution algorithm","PMODEA","direct-driven EV","torque per motor lamination volume","finite-element method","FEM analysis","static analysis","dynamic analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric vehicle (EV)","in-wheel switched reluctance motor (IW-SRM) design","multiobjective differential evolution (DE) algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592427/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"In-Wheel Switched Reluctance Motor Design for Electric Vehicles by Using a Pareto-Based Multiobjective Differential Evolution Algorithm","volume":"66","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7592427/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16965056","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TUBITAK (The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey)","grantNumber":"113M090"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Wheel Switched Reluctance Motor Design for Electric Vehicles by Using a Pareto-Based Multiobjective Differential Evolution Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tvt-oksuztepe-2618119-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068218S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7951139","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7951139","articleId":"7592427","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7592429,"authors":[{"name":"Saman Darvish Kermany","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Shahid Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran"],"bio":{"p":["Saman Darvish Kermany received the B.S. degree in electronics\n engineering from Pardis University, Zahedan, Iran in 1998 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shahid\n Chamran University, Ahvaz, Iran in 2011.

The PoI values are determined using a combination of passive, active, and communication islanding detection approaches based on the utility signals measured at the SGs sides which are processed by discrete wavelet transform using an artificial neural network (ANN). If PoIANN is larger than the threshold value (indicating high possibility of islanding) then a more accurate approach based on fuzzy network is used to recompute it (PoI\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">FU Z ZY</sub>\n ) where the fuzzy parameters are determined by an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system.

D2D users can use the delicate spectrum resources in the overlay mode, while reuse the cellular resources in the underlay mode. Based on stochastic geometry, cellular users, D2D transmitters, and relay nodes (RNs) in the networks are all modeled as Poisson point process. Then, we calculate the RN existence probability and the expectation of relay link distance to obtain the successful transmission probabilities for D2D communication. According to two relay mechanisms for enhancing D2D transmission distance, we further obtain the transmission capacities of D2D communication with the assistance of RNs in both two modes, which reflect the influence from D2D density and power. In addition, the D2D transmission capacities with variable D2D link distance are also analyzed in two modes. Simulation results verify that D2D transmission capacity can be enhanced by relay transmission and influenced by a multitude of factors, including the user density, power, the D2D link distance, and the way of using RNs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592433/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","volume":"13","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16668670","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7592433/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Transmission Capacity Analysis of Relay-Assisted Device-to-Device Overlay/Underlay Communication","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571270 and 61271266"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M591177"},{"fundingName":"British Telecom and Tsinghua SEM Advanced ICT LAB","grantNumber":"TII-16-0630"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission Capacity Analysis of Relay-Assisted Device-to-Device Overlay/Underlay Communication","sourcePdf":"tii-dai-2617921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087325S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7851099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7851099","articleId":"7592433","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7592438,"authors":[{"name":"Rajai Nasser","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Rajai Nasser received the B.Sc and M.Sc degrees in Mathematics from the Faculty of Sciences of the Lebanese University, Lebanon, in 2008 and 2010 respectively.

This paper, which is presented in two parts, solves this problem by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for a binary operation to be polarizing. This (second) part provides a foundation of polarization theory based on the ergodic theory of binary operations which we developed in the first part. We show that a binary operation is polarizing if and only if it is uniformity preserving and its right-inverse is strongly ergodic. The rate of polarization of single user channels is studied. It is shown that the exponent of any polarizing operation cannot exceed 1/2, which is the exponent of quasi-group operations. We also study the polarization of multiple access channels (MAC). In particular, we show that a sequence of binary operations is MAC-polarizing if and only if each binary operation in the sequence is polarizing. It is shown that the exponent of any MAC-polarizing sequence cannot exceed 1/2, which is the exponent of sequences of quasi-group operations.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2016.2617958","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7823065/07592438.pdf","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2617958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7823065","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ergodic Theory of Binary Operations\u2014Part II: Applications to Polarization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"An Ergodic Theory of Binary Operations\u2014Part II: Applications to Polarization","volume":"63","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598406","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7592438/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592438/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ergodic Theory of Binary Operations\u2014Part II: Applications to Polarization","sourcePdf":"tit-nasser-2617958-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160241S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7823065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7823065","articleId":"7592438","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7592440,"authors":[{"name":"Jiliang Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Laboratory of Nonlinear Circuits and Intelligent Information Processing, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Southwest University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7592440/zhang-2617893-small.gif","p":["Jiliang Zhang received the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University in 2011.

At each relay, a power splitting receiver is applied to process the received signal for information decoding and energy harvesting simultaneously, and a decode-and-forward scheme is adopted to forward the processed information. Furthermore, the energy harvester at each relay is assumed to be non-linear with a saturation threshold to limit the power level of the energy. Assuming imperfect channel state information is available both at S and D, outage performance is investigated when S adopts transmit antenna selection in the presence of feedback delay and D performs maximal ratio combining technique to deal with the multiple copies of signals with channel estimation errors.

However, this beamformer is very sensitive to sensor self-noise and mismatch among sensors, which considerably restricts its use in practical systems. This paper develops an approach to superdirective beamforming based on the Krylov matrix. We show that the columns of a proposed Krylov matrix, which span a chosen dimension of the whole space, are interesting beamformers; consequently, all different linear combinations of those columns lead to beamformers that have good properties. In particular, we develop the Krylov maximum white noise gain and Krylov maximum DF beamformers, which are obtained by maximizing the WNG and the DF, respectively. By properly choosing the dimension of the Krylov subspace, the developed beamformers that can make a compromise between reasonable values of the DF and white noise amplification. We also extend the basic idea to the design of the Krylov maximum front-to-back ratio, parametric superdirective, and parametric supercardioid beamformers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592442/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16422208","htmlLink":"/document/7592442/","displayDocTitle":"Superdirective Beamforming Based on the Krylov Matrix","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61425005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Superdirective Beamforming Based on the Krylov Matrix","sourcePdf":"taslp-chen-2618003-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1592S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7571201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7571201","articleId":"7592442","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7592443,"authors":[{"name":"Mu Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Mu Zhang received the B.E. degree in electric and electronic engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Electronic and Information Engineering.

First, the robust control problem is transformed into a corresponding optimal control problem with an augmented control and an appropriate cost function. Under the event-based mechanism, we prove that the solution of the optimal control problem can asymptotically stabilize the uncertain system with an adaptive triggering condition. That is, the designed event-based controller is robust to the original uncertain system. Note that the event-based controller is updated only when the triggering condition is satisfied, which can save the communication resources between the plant and the controller. Then, a single network adaptive dynamic programming structure with experience replay technique is constructed to approach the optimal control policies. The stability of the closed-loop system with the event-based control policy and the augmented control policy is analyzed using the Lyapunov approach. Furthermore, we prove that the minimal intersample time is bounded by a nonzero positive constant, which excludes Zeno behavior during the learning process. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2614002","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8244326/07592457.pdf","startPage":"37","endPage":"50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2614002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8244326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-Based Robust Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592457/","displayDocTitle":"Event-Based Robust Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming","volume":"29","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17468821","pubMedId":"27775539","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7592457/","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273136, 61573353, 61533017, 61304086, 61603382 and U1501251"},{"fundingName":"National Key Research and Development Plan","grantNumber":"2016YFB0101000"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4162065"},{"fundingName":"Research Fund of Tianjin Key Laboratory of Process Measurement and Control","grantNumber":"TKLPMC-201612"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event-Based Robust Control for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming","sourcePdf":"tnnls-zhao-2614002-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137882S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8244326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"8244326","articleId":"7592457","onlineDate":"14 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":7592462,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Javad Sanjari","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"p":["Mohammad Javad Sanjari received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees\n in electrical engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2006, 2008, and 2013,\n respectively.

The classification procedure is carried out by applying the pattern discovery method on the historical data of the mentioned variables. An HMC is developed based on the categorized historical data of PV power in each operating point. The 15-min ahead PDF of the PV output power is forecasted through the Gaussian mixture method (GMM) by combining several distribution functions and by using the coefficients defined based on parameters of the HMC-based model. In order to verify the proposed method, the genetic algorithm is applied to minimize a well-defined objective function to achieve the optimal GMM coefficients. Numerical tests using real data demonstrate that the forecast results follow the real probability distribution of the PV power well under different weather conditions.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2616902","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7951114/07592462.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2616902","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951114","startPage":"2942","endPage":"2952","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Forecast of PV Power Generation Based on Higher Order Markov Chain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592462","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Forecast of PV Power Generation Based on Higher Order Markov Chain","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592462/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969918","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7592462/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Energy Innovation Programme Office through the National Research Foundation and Singapore Economic Development Board"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Forecast of PV Power Generation Based on Higher Order Markov Chain","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-sanjari-2616902-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094154S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7951114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7951114","articleId":"7592462","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7592463,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiwei Zhao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7900486/7592463/zhao-2614129-small.gif","p":["Zhiwei Zhao (S\u201911\u2013M\u201916) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Zhejiang University in 2015.

Sender selection is the key to the dissemination performance and has been extensively studied. Sender impact metric plays a significant role in sender selection, since it determines which senders are selected for transmission. Recent studies have shown that spatial link diversity has a significant impact on the efficiency of broadcast. However, the existing metrics overlook such impact. Besides, they consider only gains but ignore the costs of sender candidates. As a result, existing works cannot achieve accurate estimation of the sender impact. Moreover, they cannot well support data dissemination with network coding, which is commonly used for lossy environments. In this paper, we first propose a novel sender impact metric, namely, \u03b3, which jointly exploits link quality and spatial link diversity to calculate the gain/cost ratio of the sender candidates. Then, we develop a generic sender selection scheme based on the \u03b3 metric (called \u03b3-component) that can generally support both types of dissemination using native packets and network coding. Extensive evaluations are conducted through real testbed experiments and large-scale simulations. The performance results and analysis show that \u03b3 achieves far more accurate impact estimation than the existing works. In addition, the dissemination protocols based on \u03b3-component outperform the existing protocols in terms of completion time and transmissions (by 20.5% and 23.1%,

technology in future mobile communications. In this letter, we study the channel estimation and power allocation problem for the two-user NOMA downlink system with one strong user and one weak user. Firstly, we introduce a new type of linear estimator that aims at maximizing the average effective signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) of the strong user with bounded average effective SINR guaranteed for the weak user. We propose a constrained concave convex procedure (CCCP)-based iterative algorithm to solve the estimation problem. Secondly, we also derive the maximum average effective SINR of the strong user under the traditional maximum-likelihood (ML)-based estimator and linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE)-based estimator, respectively. Simulation results have shown that the proposed estimator outperforms the traditional ML and LMMSE estimators, indicating a new way of channel estimation and power allocation for the NOMA downlink systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592469/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","volume":"23","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16442123","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7592469/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Novel Channel Estimation for Non-orthogonal Multiple Access Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472458 and 61672549"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030311032, 2014A030313111 and 2014A030310374"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004000","fundingName":"Guangzhou Science and Technology Program","grantNumber":"201607010098"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"15lgzd10 and 15lgpy15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Channel Estimation for Non-orthogonal Multiple Access Systems","sourcePdf":"lsp-tan-2617897-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049354S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7604153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7604153","articleId":"7592469","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7592535,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Fu Tsai","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Fu","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37085759169"},{"name":"Jen-Chou Tseng","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jen-Chou","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37338725800"},{"name":"Chung-Yu Huang","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-Yu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085875112"},{"name":"Tzu-Heng Chang","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Heng","lastName":"Chang","id":"37734748600"},{"name":"Kuo-Ji Chen","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Kuo-Ji","lastName":"Chen","id":"38183800100"},{"name":"Ming-Hsiang Song","affiliation":["TSMC, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-Hsiang","lastName":"Song","id":"37421000200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5853-7289-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8926-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7592535","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":732},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surges","Clamps","Surge protection","Electrostatic discharges","Stress","System-on-chip","FinFETs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrostatic discharge","MOSFET","surge protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-chip combo clamp","universal ESD protection","surge protection","bulk FinFET technology","ready-made ESD clamp transistor","CDM","HBM","surge event","RC-based core ESD clamp","surge immunity","electrostatic discharge","voltage 0.7 V","voltage 4 V to 19 V"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592535","abstract":"A surge protection consisted of the ready-made ESD clamp transistors has been designed and characterized in FINFET technology.

Cloud and IoT integration resulting in so-called edge cloud and fog computing has started. This requires the combination of data centre technologies with much more constrained devices, but still using virtualised solutions to deal with scalability, flexibility and multi-tenancy concerns. Lightweight virtualisation solutions do exist for this architectural setting with smaller, but still virtualised devices to provide application and platform technology as services. Containerisation is a solution component for lightweight virtualisation solution. Containers are furthermore relevant for cloud platform concerns dealt with by Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) clouds like application packaging and orchestration. We demonstrate an architecture for edge cloud PaaS. For edge clouds, application and service orchestration can help to manage and orchestrate applications through containers. In this way, computation can be brought to the edge of the cloud, rather than data from the Internet-of-Things (IoT) to the cloud. We show that edge cloud requirements such as cost-efficiency, low power consumption, and robustness can be met by implementing container and cluster technology on small single-board devices like Raspberry Pis. This architecture can facilitate applications through distributed multi-cloud platforms built from a range of nodes from data centres to small devices, which we refer to as edge cloud. We illustrate key concepts of an edge cloud PaaS and refer to experimental and conceptual work to make that case.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet

Although the latter methods allow a detailed insight into scientific cooperation and communities, the major part of the data, the text body of the publication, is mostly ignored. Hence, this text body contains valuable data, which can be processed in order to describe entities in a research network, detect synergies between those entities and make use of these synergies, e.g. in further cooperation. This paper aims at the description of a prototypic architecture, which uses data science to detect hidden topics from publication data. These topics are used to describe entities (e.g. institutes or projects) in a research network. Topical proximity between those entities is computed by the application of classification. In order to enable actors to explore the results of these processes, the architecture automatically generates graph-based visualizations of the derived synergies. This paper contains a description and definition of the technical elements and the process chain of the architecture to derive these synergies in network data.

In wireless relay networks, employing SWIET at the source-to-relay link, an energy-constrained relay node can harvest energy from the radio-frequency (RF) signals transmitted by a source node while assisting information relaying, and thus its lifetime can be prolonged. In this paper, we investigate an orthogonal-frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network with SWIET. The goal is to maximize the end-to-end achievable rate. Unlike the work in literature where only peak transmit power constraint at source is considered, we consider both peak and average transmit power constraints at source, by which the operation time of the source's batteries can be extended. The formulated problem is non-convex because the average transmit power constraint at source and the EH constraint at relay are non-convex. To tackle this non-convex problem, we transform it into two fractional programming problems. By solving the two fractional programming problems with Dinkelbach's procedure, we propose two algorithms to achieve optimal resource allocations. Simulation results verify the optimality of our proposed resource allocation scheme and show that the average power constraint at source has much impact on the end-to-end achievable rate of the SWIET-based OFDM AF relay network.","doi":"10.1109/W-FiCloud.2016.68","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592515/7592673/07592742.pdf","startPage":"304","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/W-FiCloud.2016.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7592673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Resource Allocation Optimization in OFDM Relay Networks with SWIET","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592742","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592742/","displayDocTitle":"Joint Resource Allocation Optimization in OFDM Relay Networks with SWIET","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16380138","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7592742/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Resource Allocation Optimization in OFDM Relay Networks with SWIET","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"3946a304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053401S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592515","isNumber":"7592673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592515","xplore-issue":"7592673","articleId":"7592742","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7592745,"authors":[{"name":"Eloi Gabaldon","affiliation":["Dept. of CS., Universitat de Lleida, Lleida, Spain"],"firstName":"Eloi","lastName":"Gabaldon","id":"37085894232"},{"name":"Fernando Guirado","affiliation":["Dept. of CS., Universitat de Lleida, Lleida, Spain"],"firstName":"Fernando","lastName":"Guirado","id":"37297566400"},{"name":"Josep Lluis Lerida","affiliation":["Dept. of CS., Universitat de Lleida, Lleida, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep Lluis","lastName":"Lerida","id":"37296656500"},{"name":"Jordi Planes","affiliation":["Dept. of CS., Universitat de Lleida, Lleida, Spain"],"firstName":"Jordi","lastName":"Planes","id":"37313353200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3946-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3947-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7592745","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy consumption","Resource management","Processor scheduling","Particle swarm optimization","Mathematical model","Turning","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","energy consumption","minimisation","parallel processing","particle swarm optimisation","power aware computing","processor scheduling","workstation clusters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization scheduling","energy saving","cluster computing heterogeneous environments","large-scale computing facilities","load predictions","energy consumption reduction","optimal matching","parallel applications","application-task variability","NP-hard problem","PSO-based heuristics","scheduling decision generation","overall energy consumption minimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Energy Saving","Federated Clusters","Scheduling","Co-allocation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592745","abstract":"Reducing energy consumption in large-scale computing facilities has become a major concern in recent years. Most techniques have been focused on determining the computing requirements based on load predictions and thus turning unnecessary nodes on and off. Nevertheless, once the available resources have been configured, new opportunities arise for reducing energy consumption by providing optimal matching of parallel applications to the available computing nodes. Those techniques have received little attention. The large number of computing nodes, heterogeneity and variability of application-tasks are factors that turn the scheduling into an NP-Hard problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach by using a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based heuristic to generate scheduling decisions that minimize the overall energy consumption.","doi":"10.1109/W-FiCloud.2016.71","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592515/7592673/07592745.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"325","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/W-FiCloud.2016.71","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7592673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Scheduling for Energy Saving in Cluster Computing Heterogeneous Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Particle Swarm Optimization Scheduling for Energy Saving in Cluster Computing Heterogeneous Environments","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16380146","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7592745/","conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle Swarm Optimization Scheduling for Energy Saving in Cluster Computing Heterogeneous Environments","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"3946a321.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091661S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592515","isNumber":"7592673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592515","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7592673","articleId":"7592745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7592746,"authors":[{"name":"Thinh Le Vinh","affiliation":["CEDRIC Lab, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Thinh Le","lastName":"Vinh","id":"37085437831"},{"name":"Reddy Pallavali","affiliation":["CEDRIC Lab, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Reddy","lastName":"Pallavali","id":"37085881189"},{"name":"Fatiha Houacine","affiliation":["CEDRIC Lab, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Fatiha","lastName":"Houacine","id":"37085874720"},{"name":"Samia Bouzefrane","affiliation":["CEDRIC Lab, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Samia","lastName":"Bouzefrane","id":"37660016800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3946-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3947-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7592746","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":547},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","Computer architecture","Servers","Containers","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","mobile computing","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency","mobile cloud computing architectures","MCC","mobile technology","computational services","cloud service providers","network operators","ICT related devices","OSGi","container based solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mobile computing","Cloud computing","OSGi","container"]}],"abstract":"Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) is an emerging and popular mobile technology which uses fully available Cloud Computing services and functionalities.

To securely integrate the UAs into the general airspace, a reliable link to control and monitor those UAs is essentially required. The link between a UA and its GCS (Ground Control Station) is referred to as the CNPC (Control and Non-Payload Communication) link and the network including UAs and GCS is referred to as the integrated CNPC network. The CNPC link may include a terrestrial network such as the LTE (Long Term Evolution) and the terrestrial network connects a UA to a GCS. In this paper, we propose a communication architecture to integrate the LTE technology into the integrated CNPC network and defines the security requirements of the communication architecture. Then, we modify an authentication and key agreement protocol and handover key management protocols for the network. We compare the modified protocols with LTE counterpart protocols. Our comparison shows that the modified protocols outperforms the LTE counterpart protocols in terms of security while it induces almost the same volume of communication overhead. Our future work is to do a series of simulations to evaluate the performance and security of our protocols rigorously.","doi":"10.1109/W-FiCloud.2016.78","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 4th International Conference on Future Internet of Things and Cloud Workshops (FiCloudW)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592515/7592673/07592752.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/W-FiCloud.2016.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7592673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Authentication and Key Management in an LTE-Based Unmanned Aerial System Control and Non-payload Communication Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 Aug. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592752/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Aug. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Authentication and Key Management in an LTE-Based Unmanned Aerial System Control and Non-payload Communication Network","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7592752/","accessionNumber":"16380142","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Authentication and Key Management in an LTE-Based Unmanned Aerial System Control and Non-payload Communication Network","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"3946a355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046385S","chronDate":"22-24 Aug. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7592515","isNumber":"7592673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7592515","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7592673","articleId":"7592752","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-09"},{"_id":7592835,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5044-2335-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7592835","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":587},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592835","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["IEEE Standards","Ethernet","Time measurement","Synchronization","Passive optical networks","IEEE 802.3 Standard"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","local area networks","telecommunication network management","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standard","ethernet","interspersing express traffic","IEEE Std 802.3-2015","express traffic","physical link"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ethernet","express traffic","IEEE 802(R)","IEEE 802.3(TM)","IEEE 802.3br(TM)","preemption"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IEEESTD.2016.7592835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Std 802.3br-2016 (Amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2015 as amended by IEEE Std 802.3bw-2015, IEEE Std 802.3by-2016, IEEE Std 802.3bq-2016, and IEEE Std 802.3bp-2016)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Std 802.3br-2016 (Amendment to IEEE Std 802.3-2015 as amended by IEEE Std 802.3bw-2015, IEEE Std 802.3by-2016, IEEE Std 802.3bq-2016, and IEEE Std 802.3bp-2016)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7592833/7592834/07592835.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEEESTD.2016.7592835","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7592834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"802.3br-2016 -

In our framework, CNNs are directly trained to produce classification maps out of the input images. We first devise a fully convolutional architecture and demonstrate its relevance to the dense classification problem. We then address the issue of imperfect training data through a two-step training approach: CNNs are first initialized by using a large amount of possibly inaccurate reference data, and then refined on a small amount of accurately labeled data. To complete our framework, we design a multiscale neuron module that alleviates the common tradeoff between recognition and precise localization. A series of experiments show that our networks consider a large amount of context to provide fine-grained classification maps.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2612821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2612821","startPage":"645","endPage":"657","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7801970/07592858.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801970","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convolutional Neural Networks for Large-Scale Remote-Sensing Image Classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Convolutional Neural Networks for Large-Scale Remote-Sensing Image Classification","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16581165","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7592858/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Centre National d\u2019Etudes Spatiales"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convolutional Neural Networks for Large-Scale Remote-Sensing Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-maggiori-2612821-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140453S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7801970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"486","xplore-issue":"7801970","articleId":"7592858","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":7592859,"authors":[{"name":"Cheol Ho Kim","affiliation":["Mobile Communication RF Research Section, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Cheol Ho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085566778"},{"name":"Bonghyuk Park","affiliation":["Mobile Communication RF Research Section, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Bonghyuk","lastName":"Park","id":"37085396650"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"7592859","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2299},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592859","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MMICs","Gallium nitride","Linearity","Gain","Power amplifiers","Long Term Evolution","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency response","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","intermodulation distortion","Long Term Evolution","MMIC power amplifiers","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully-integrated two-stage gallium nitride MMIC Doherty power amplifier","LTE small cells","two-stage Doherty PA","gallium nitride-on-silicon carbide monolithic microwave integrated circuit","small-cell base stations","asymmetric Doherty configuration","reversed uneven input power splitting network","third-order intermodulation distortion","IMD3","peaking amplifiers","two-section quarterwave transformer","in-band frequency responses","power-added efficiency","Long-Term Evolution signal","peak-to-average power ratio","adjacent channel leakage ratio","digital pre-distortion linearization","size 0.25 mum","efficiency 46.8 percent","gain 30.9 dB","frequency 2.655 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doherty power amplifiers (Doherty PAs)","gallium nitride (GaN)","long-term evolution (LTE)","monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC)"]}],"abstract":"A novel two-stage Doherty power amplifier (PA) was designed and fully integrated on a 0.25-\u03bcm GaN on SiC monolithic microwave integrated circuit die with a dimension of 3.3 \u00d7 2.6 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n to build small-cell base stations.

To overcome the drawback of sampling-based methods that huge computation resources are required and the shortcoming of initial contingency selection practices that the dependencies in sequences of outages are omitted, this paper proposes a novel risk assessment approach by searching on Markovian Tree. The Markovian tree model is reformulated from the quasi-dynamic multitimescale simulation model proposed recently to ensure reasonable modeling and simulation of cascading outages. Then, a tree search scheme is established to avoid duplicated simulations on same cascade paths, significantly saving the computation time. To accelerate the convergence of a risk assessment, a risk estimation index is proposed to guide the search for states with major contributions to the risk, and the risk assessment is realized based on the risk estimation index with a forward tree search and backward update algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated on a four-node power system, and its convergence profile as well as efficiency is demonstrated on the RTS-96 test system.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7951114/07592860.pdf","startPage":"2887","endPage":"2900","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2618365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2618365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Risk Assessment of Multi-Timescale Cascading Outages Based on Markovian Tree Search","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592860/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Risk Assessment of Multi-Timescale Cascading Outages Based on Markovian Tree Search","htmlLink":"/document/7592860/","publicationDate":"July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16969932","isJournal":true,"volume":"32","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Foundation for Innovative Research Groups"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51321005"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51377091"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008421","fundingName":"Electric Power Research Institute"},{"fundingName":"State Grid Sichuan Electric Power Company"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Risk Assessment of Multi-Timescale Cascading Outages Based on Markovian Tree Search","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-liu-2618365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1638S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7951114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7951114","articleId":"7592860","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7592862,"authors":[{"name":"Shigang Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Image Understanding of Ministry of Education, International Research Center for Intelligent Perception and Computation, Joint International Research Laboratory of Intelligent Perception and Computation, School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China"],"bio":{"p":["\nShigang Wang received the double bachelor's degrees in automation and \nEnglish from Lanzhou Jiaotong University, Lanzhou, China, in 2012.

In this paper, inspired by the multilayer selective cognition property of the human visual system, we advance a new hierarchical saliency filtering method for fast and accurate ship detection in high-resolution SAR images. The saliency of targets is first explored to develop a random-forest-based hierarchical sparse model (HSM) for the selection of candidate target regions. Then, a dynamic constant-false-alarm-rate-based contour saliency model (CSM) is proposed to gradually filter out the false alarms from candidate regions and extract the target outlines for accurate detection. Because of a rapid capture of regions of interest in the HSM and dynamic false alarm removal in the CSM, our method can make efficient ship detection in high-resolution SAR images possible by working in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, the proposed ship detector is tested on high-resolution SAR data collected from TerraSAR and RADARSAT satellites, showing significant agreement with the ground truth.

Contrary to the existing multilayer designs where metallic via is used for the interconnections, the proposed technique uses the folding of the structure designed in a flexible substrate. Thus, the multilayer structure is obtained from a thin printed circuit board that is folded to give the desired 3-D structure. The proposed structure consists of cascaded commensurate transmission line sections (also known as C-sections) coupled at alternative ends. The group delay (GD) characteristic of the C-sections is utilized for encoding. Broad side coupling of the structure is exploited here, which enables large GD with higher frequency selectivity. It is proved that to produce the same amount of delay, linearly cascaded C-sections demands five times more number of C-sections than that of a multilayered structure, which also signifies the factor of miniaturization of the proposed design. A coding capacity of 6 and 12 b is estimated from the simulation, respectively, for single group and multigroup of multilayered C-sections in the allowed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) bands. This shows for the first time that frequency domain chipless technology can be compatible with the use of ISM bands. It also allows a coding capacity of 43 b in the ultra-wideband band which is comparable with the EAN 13 barcode.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2613049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7777000/07592867.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2613049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7777000","startPage":"4298","endPage":"4311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Folded Multilayer C-Sections With Large Group Delay Swing for Passive Chipless RFID Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Folded Multilayer C-Sections With Large Group Delay Swing for Passive Chipless RFID Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519067","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7592867/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001665","fundingName":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche","grantNumber":"ANR-09-VERS-013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Folded Multilayer C-Sections With Large Group Delay Swing for Passive Chipless RFID Applications","sourcePdf":"tmtt-perret-2613049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073384S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7777000","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7777000","articleId":"7592867","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7592875,"authors":[{"name":"Huaping Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, State Key Laboratory of Intelligent Technology and Systems, TNLIST, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/8101048/7592875/liu-2614809-small.gif","p":["Huaping Liu received the Ph.D degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2004.","He is an Associate Professor with the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University.

The model is developed with the objective to simplify the parameter identification procedure, while representing adequately the thermal effects on the battery performance. Most of the well-accepted electrothermal Li-ion battery models require in-depth and proprietary battery data or dedicated test environments for parameter identification. The dedicated test bench usually involves expensive thermal test chambers, calorimeters, and temperatures sensors, and challenges associated with their installations. This makes the electrical and thermal simulation of Li-ion batteries difficult to achieve. This paper proposes a generic electrothermal model with a simpler parameter identification process. The parameters identification process is solely based on datasheet discharge curves and simple experiments at room temperature.

The tuning microchannels are integrated in the organic materials, while the cooling microchannels are micromachined in a copper carrier. The tuning allows the PA to switch the frequency of operation from 2.4 to 5.8 GHz and vice versa. Heat removal is achieved by the motion of distilled water below the GaN die, while tuning is achieved by swapping air and acetone inside the source and load matching network microchannels.

Optical gratings located on various layers are commonly used as the targets for the detection of the overlay displacement offset in DBO measurement. The asymmetry in intensity between the 1st and -1st beams diffracted by the targets is used for the prediction of grating displacement offset. This paper describes the effect of grating targets with sidewall angles (SWAs) on asymmetry in intensity and proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) method for enhancing the accuracy of grating displacement offset prediction. Grating targets with a 1:3 line-to-pitch ratio and SWA profiles varying from 86\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 were employed in this paper. The asymmetry in the intensity of the designed targets was computed for incident beams with transverse-electric and transverse-magnetic polarization at visible wavelength. An ANN feed-forward model was developed for the displacement offset prediction. The ANN, the conventional linear model, and the regression models were evaluated using diffraction data calculated by a numerical electromagnetic solver. The mean square error and the mean of the residual indicated that using the ANN model and incident beams at wavelengths of 600, 650, and 750 nm is substantially more effective for prediction than the conventional linear model is.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2618350","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07592879.pdf","startPage":"7479","endPage":"7486","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2618350","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial Neural Network for Diffraction Based Overlay Measurement","topic":"Industry 4.0","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592879/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Artificial Neural Network for Diffraction Based Overlay Measurement","volume":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"16470586","publicationDate":"2016","htmlLink":"/document/7592879/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"104-3011-E-011-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Artificial Neural Network for Diffraction Based Overlay Measurement","sourcePdf":"access-kuo-2618350-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117378S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Industry 4.0"],"articleId":"7592879","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":7592882,"authors":[{"name":"Usman Ashraf","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Networking, CCSIT, King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Usman","lastName":"Ashraf","orcid":"0000-0001-6288-3513","id":"37640881300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7592882","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":643},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Interference","Energy consumption","Mesh networks","Greedy algorithms","Wireless mesh networks","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","greedy algorithms","integer programming","internetworking","linear programming","radiofrequency interference","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MILP formulation","maximal independent sets","physical-interference model","heuristic-based greedy algorithm","NP-hard problem","mixed-integer linear programming","optimal gateway placement","green wireless mesh networks","energy-aware gateway placement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless mesh networks","energy","interference"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592882","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7809126/07592882.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"159","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618378","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Gateway Placement in Green Wireless Mesh Networks","abstract":"In this letter, we address the following problem: given a mesh network deployment and |G| gateways to be added, what is the optimal gateway placement with the constraint of energy-minimization for green wireless mesh networks. Unlike previous research, which focuses on throughput optimization, we contribute by developing a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, which satisfies the given flow demands while minimizing the global energy consumption of the network. The proposed solution is NP-hard; therefore, we also propose a heuristic-based greedy algorithm to efficiently solve large instances of this problem. To capture interference in the mesh network, we use the physical-interference model but employ a greedy algorithm to reduce the computation time for finding maximal independent sets. We implement both the MILP formulation and the greedy solution along with three other contemporary solutions in the area.

This makes it possible and necessary to comparatively analyze the different data at a network level. Global network alignment is an important network comparison approach to identify conserved subnetworks and get insight into evolutionary relationship across species. Network alignment which is analogous to subgraph isomorphism is known to be an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we introduce a novel heuristic Particle-Swarm-Optimization based Network Aligner (PSONA), which optimizes a weighted global alignment model considering both protein sequence similarity and interaction conservations. The particle statuses and status updating rules are redefined in a discrete form by using permutation. A seed-and-extend strategy is employed to guide the searching for the superior alignment. The proposed initialization method \u201cseeds\u201d matches with high sequence similarity into the alignment, which guarantees the functional coherence of the mapping nodes. A greedy local search method is designed as the \u201cextension\u201d procedure to iteratively optimize the edge conservations. PSONA is compared with several state-of-art methods on ten network pairs combined by five species. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aligner can map the proteins with high functional coherence and can be used as a booster to effectively refine the well-studied aligners.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2016.2618380","startPage":"705","endPage":"718","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/8371203/07592892.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2016.2618380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8371203","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Global Network Alignment Method Using Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proteins","NP-hard problem","Particle swarm optimization","Coherence","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biotechnology","computational complexity","data analysis","graph theory","molecular biophysics","particle swarm optimisation","proteins","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conserved subnetworks","NP-hard problem","novel heuristic Particle-Swarm-Optimization","Network Aligner","weighted global alignment model","protein sequence similarity","interaction conservations","particle statuses","status updating rules","discrete form","superior alignment","high sequence similarity","greedy local search method","network pairs","global network alignment method","discrete particle swarm optimization","molecular interactions data increase","network level","initialization method","data analysis","network comparison approach","seed-and-extend strategy","PSONA","subgraph isomorphism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","biological network alignment","topological similarity","sequence similarity"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Computational Biology","Databases, Protein","Humans","Models, Biological","Protein Interaction Mapping","Proteins","Sequence Alignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592892/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Global Network Alignment Method Using Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7592892/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May-June 2018","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2018","accessionNumber":"17822265","pubMedId":"27775534","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273317, 61422209 and 61473215"},{"fundingName":"National Program for Support of Top-notch Young Professionals of China"},{"fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education","grantNumber":"20130203110011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Global Network Alignment Method Using Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcbb-gong-2618380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137927S","chronDate":"May-June 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"8371203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8371203","articleId":"7592892","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":7592893,"authors":[{"name":"Eva Antonino-Daviu","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicaciones y Aplicaciones Multimedia, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Valencia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7769172/7592893/anton-2618478-small.gif","p":["Eva Antonino-Daviu (M\u201900) was born in Valencia, Spain, in 1978.

The theory of characteristic modes (CMs) is used to identify the collection of current modes that exists on these structures, dealing to a valuable understanding of the radiating mechanisms and allowing a more controlled design process. Modal analysis of a circular aperture cut on a finite square ground plane is presented in order to demonstrate that an optimum choice of the feeding mechanism can be made according to the current distribution of the desired modes. Based on the information yielded by this modal analysis, a capacitive-coupled dual-feed circular aperture antenna is presented. This antenna takes advantage of the symmetries of the characteristic currents by making use of multiple feeding, in order to excite only some particular modes. Usage of commonly-fed and differentially-fed configurations enables an increased control of the excitation of modes in the structure.

As a widely used technique of dimensionality reduction, feature selection is about selecting a feature subset being guided by certain criterion. In this paper, three unsupervised feature selection algorithms are proposed and addressed from the viewpoint of sparse graph embedding learning. First, using the self-characterization of the given data, we view the data themselves as a dictionary, conduct sparse coding and propose the sparsity preserving feature selection (SPFS) algorithm. Second, considering the locality preservation of neighborhoods for the data, we study a special case of the SPFS problem, namely, neighborhood preserving feature selection problem, and come up with a suitable algorithm. Third, we incorporate sparse coding and feature selection into one unified framework, and propose a neighborhood embedding feature selection (NEFS) criterion. Drawing support from nonnegative matrix factorization, the corresponding algorithm for NEFS is presented and its convergence is proved. Finally, the three proposed algorithms are validated with the use of eight publicly available real-world datasets from machine learning repository. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms over four compared state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592899/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 2018","accessionNumber":"17578130","htmlLink":"/document/7592899/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2018","volume":"48","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Sparse Graph Embedding Unsupervised Feature Selection","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61502104 and 61379049"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse Graph Embedding Unsupervised Feature Selection","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wang-2605132-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125415S","chronDate":"March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8291729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"8291729","articleId":"7592899","onlineDate":"17 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7592901,"authors":[{"name":"Abdolmehdi Dadgarpour","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7769172/7592901/dadga-2618485-small.gif","p":["Abdolmehdi Dadgarpour (M\u201916) received the B.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from the Azad University of Jahrom, Fars, Iran, and the M.Sc. degree in telecommunications engineering from Azad University, Science and Research Branch, Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications from the Energy, Materials, and Telecommunications Center at the Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique, University of Qu\u00e9bec, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada, in 2015.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow with Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al.

However, the mostly existing systems only focus on the logic reasoning but ignore the factor of the user's emotion, which is regarded as an important factor to impact human health. In this paper, we design a system for big data application in emotion-aware healthcare (BDAEH), which pays attention to both the logic reasoning and the emotion computing. Meanwhile, the SDN the and 5G technologies are adopted in the BDAHE system to improve the resource utilization and the overall network performance of the system. The BDAEH system includes the following functions: healthcare data collection, healthcare data transmission, healthcare data storage, healthcare data analysis, and human-machine interaction. The healthcare data are generated by wearable devices or sensing-less sensors, and these healthcare data are regarded as the foundation to expand a series of data processing. The healthcare data transmission is performed through leveraging the SDN and the 5G technologies. In the data center, the related technologies based on cloud computing are utilized to store and analyze healthcare data, which obtains both the emotion and the health state of the users, and the relation between the emotion and the illness. Finally, the BDAEH system returns the analysis result to the users or the doctors for further treatment schemes or rehabilitation advice.

Direct conversion architecture, symmetric subcarrier modulation, and bandpass sampling techniques are used to obtain a cost-effective solution. An arcsine algorithm and a motion imaging algorithm are proposed to linearly reconstruct the hand and finger motions in a 2-D plane from the demodulated Doppler phase shifts. Experimental results verified the effectiveness of the proposed architecture and algorithms. Different from the frequency-domain \u201cmicro-Doppler\u201d approach, the proposed remote gesture recognition based on linear motion reconstruction is able to recognize definitive signatures for the corresponding motions, exhibiting promising potential in practical applications of human-computer interaction.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel7/22/7733167/07592916.pdf","startPage":"4012","endPage":"4020","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2016.2610427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2016.2610427","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7733167","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Hand Gesture Recognition Based on Continuous-Wave Doppler Radar Sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler radar","Sensors","Doppler effect","Computer architecture","Radio frequency","Modulation","Imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","gesture recognition","human-robot interaction","image motion analysis","image reconstruction","remote sensing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless hand gesture recognition","continuous-wave Doppler radar sensors","dual-channel Doppler radar sensor","arcsine algorithm","motion imaging algorithm","hand motion","finger motion","demodulated Doppler phase shifts","remote gesture recognition","linear motion reconstruction","human-computer interaction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doppler radar sensor","hand gesture recognition (HGR)","linear motion imaging","mouse","subcarrier modulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Hand Gesture Recognition Based on Continuous-Wave Doppler Radar Sensors","volume":"64","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7592916/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16427809","dateOfInsertion":"03 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61131002, 61528104 and 61071063"},{"fundingName":"Program for the Top Young Innovative Talents","grantNumber":"Q1313-03"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Hand Gesture Recognition Based on Continuous-Wave Doppler Radar Sensors","sourcePdf":"tmtt-ye-2610427-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086837S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7733167","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7733167","articleId":"7592916","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":7592917,"authors":[{"name":"Arthur J.

To perform such a function, the machine had to be designed with a very wide constant power-speed range. During engine-start/motoring mode, a peak torque demand of 54 N \u00b7 m at 8 kr/min was met, while in generating mode, 19.2-32 kr/min, the machine was designed to deliver a constant power of 45 kW.

One prominent characteristic of MMTC is massive connections which brings a critical challenge of multiple access interference (MAI) on channel estimation, user identification, and data detection. Currently, various techniques have been proposed to mitigate the MAI, but those MAI alleviations are limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel technique called tandem spreading network-coded division multiple access (TSNDMA) to effectively cope with the MAI problem. In this technique, first a novel channel-reciprocity-based precompensation scheme is proposed for channel estimation. Then, a tandem spreading mechanism and a physical-layer network coding-based redundancy design are introduced for user identification and data detection with corresponding algorithms at the receiver. Simulation results show that TSNDMA can effectively mitigate the MAI to achieve a favorable system performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Redundancy","Receivers","Uplink","Downlink","Algorithm design and analysis","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","code division multiple access","interference suppression","Internet of Things","network coding","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tandem spreading network-coded division multiple access","TSNDMA","massive machine-type communication","Internet of Things industry","massive connections","multiple access interference mitigation","channel estimation","user identification","data detection","MAI alleviations","channel-reciprocity-based precompensation scheme","physical-layer network coding","redundancy design","radio receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive machine-type communication (MMTC)","network coding","tandem spreading"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TII.2016.2618346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7851099/07592922.pdf","startPage":"390","endPage":"398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7851099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2016.2618346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tandem Spreading Network-Coded Division Multiple Access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592922","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tandem Spreading Network-Coded Division Multiple Access","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592922/","volume":"13","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7592922/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16668693","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004356","fundingName":"Nokia"},{"fundingName":"National 863 Project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A706"},{"fundingName":"Key Project from Beijing Science and Technology Commission","grantNumber":"D151100000115004"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Base Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China","grantNumber":"2015JM6320"},{"fundingName":"Key grant Project of Chinese Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"313006"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1334202 and 61571034"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005023","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety","grantNumber":"RCS2016ZT013"},{"fundingName":"Special Project of Cultivation and Development of Science and Technology Innovation Base","grantNumber":"TII-16-0743"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tandem Spreading Network-Coded Division Multiple Access","sourcePdf":"tii-geai-2618346-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102901S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7851099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7851099","articleId":"7592922","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":7592923,"authors":[{"name":"Sadia Alam","affiliation":["Center for Research in Analog and VLSI Microsystem Design, School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Massey University, Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Sadia","lastName":"Alam","id":"38235495600"},{"name":"S.

However, the somatosensory feedback from the prosthesis to the user is still missing. The sensory substitution methods described in the literature comprise mostly simple position and force sensors combined with discrete stimulation units. The present study describes a novel system for sophisticated electrotactile feedback integrating advanced distributed sensing (electronic skin) and stimulation (matrix electrodes). The system was tested in eight healthy subjects who were asked to recognize the shape, trajectory, and direction of a set of dynamic movement patterns (single lines, geometrical objects, letters) presented on the electronic skin. The experiments demonstrated that the system successfully translated the mechanical interaction into the moving electrotactile profiles, which the subjects could recognize with a good performance (shape recognition: 86 + 8% lines, 73 + 13% geometries, 72 + 12% letters). In particular, the subjects could identify the movement direction with a high confidence. These results are in accordance with previous studies investigating the recognition of moving stimuli in human subjects. This is an important development towards closed-loop prostheses providing comprehensive and sophisticated tactile feedback to the user, facilitating the control and the embodiment of the artificial device into the user body scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592935/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2017","volume":"10","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2017","accessionNumber":"16978069","pubMedId":"27775538","htmlLink":"/document/7592935/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A System for Electrotactile Feedback Using Electronic Skin and Flexible Matrix Electrodes: Experimental Evaluation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004702","fundingName":"University of Genoa"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"231500"},{"fundingName":"MYOSENS","grantNumber":"FP7-PEOPLE-2011-IAPP-286208"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004702","fundingName":"University of Genova"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A System for Electrotactile Feedback Using Electronic Skin and Flexible Matrix Electrodes: Experimental Evaluation","sourcePdf":"toh-franceschi-2618377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118448S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"4543165","isNumber":"7951094","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4543165","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7951094","articleId":"7592935","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7592941,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Yang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Power System Intelligent Dispatch and Control and Collaborative Innovation Center of Global Energy Internet, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7592941/yang-2618623-small.gif","p":["Ming Yang (M\u201909) received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2003 and 2009, respectively.

It is hard to predict the CFR precisely, although great efforts have been made to improve the estimation accuracy. One significant difficulty is the lack of available outage samples, due to which the law of large numbers is no longer applicable and no convincing statistical result can be obtained. To address this problem, in this paper, a novel imprecise probabilistic approach is proposed to estimate the CFR of an OTL. The imprecise Dirichlet model (IDM) is applied to establish the imprecise probabilistic relation between an operational condition and the OTL failure. Then a credal network is constructed to integrate the IDM estimation results corresponding to various operational conditions and infer the CFR of the OTL. Instead of providing a single-valued estimation result, the proposed approach predicts the possible interval of the CFR in order to explicitly indicate the uncertainty of the estimation and more objectively represent the available knowledge. The proposed approach is illustrated by estimating the CFRs of two LGJ-300 transmission lines located in the same region, and it is also compared with the existing approaches by using data generated from a virtual OTL. Test results indicate that the proposed approach can obtain much tighter and more reasonable CFR intervals compared with the contrast approaches.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Power transmission lines","Reliability","Probabilistic logic","Uncertainty","Meteorology","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","power overhead lines","power transmission reliability","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conditional failure rate","overhead transmission line","power system operational reliability assessment","estimation accuracy","novel imprecise probabilistic approach","imprecise Dirichlet model","imprecise probabilistic relation","operational condition","OTL failure","LGJ-300 transmission lines","virtual OTL","tighter CFR intervals","interval estimation","IDM estimation","single-valued estimation","CFR intervals","credal network","estimation uncertainty"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Credal network","failure rate estimation","imprecise Dirichlet model","imprecise probability","overhead transmission line","reliability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSG.2016.2618623","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/8388565/07592941.pdf","startPage":"2752","endPage":"2763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8388565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2016.2618623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interval Estimation for Conditional Failure Rates of Transmission Lines With Limited Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7592941","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165411/8388565/7592941-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interval Estimation for Conditional Failure Rates of Transmission Lines With Limited Samples","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7592941/","volume":"9","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7592941/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17857428","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51007047 and 51477091"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB228205"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009108","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006130","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Interval Estimation for Conditional Failure Rates of Transmission Lines With Limited Samples","sourcePdf":"tsg-wang-2618623-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111782S","chronDate":"July  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"8388565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8388565","articleId":"7592941","onlineDate":"17 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7593025,"authors":[{"name":"Satish S Bhairannawar","affiliation":["Dept. of E&C, DSCE, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Satish S","lastName":"Bhairannawar","id":"38667129100"},{"name":"Rajath Kumar","affiliation":["Dept. of E&C, DSCE, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Rajath","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085875997"},{"name":"Varsha Mirji","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication, DayanandaSagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"Varsha","lastName":"Mirji","id":"37085875496"},{"name":"P S Sindhu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics and Communication, DayanandaSagar College of Engineering, Bengaluru, India"],"firstName":"P S","lastName":"Sindhu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0037-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7593025","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":285},"abstract":"Face recognition is gaining more importance in today's real world for automated transactions.

So an alternative method called active noise cancellation that separates noise signal and speech signal is chosen. Zero frequency filter is a technique used for active noise cancellation of noisy speech signals. This filter is used for the characterization of glottal activity from speech signals thereby cancelling the noise. The main advantage of this method when compared to other noise cancellation methods is that noise need not be modeled separately. In this paper is to present the VLSI implementation architecture of zero frequency filter with useful clock skew optimization. This architecture can be used as voice processor in mobile applications. As clock frequency increases and the technology move towards sub-nanometer process, handling timing violations in the design becomes an increasingly complex and challenging task. Traditional approaches target for global zero skew in the process of timing closure costs in area and power and also limits the maximum achievable operating frequency. Useful clock skew optimization is an emerging technique that helps achieve timing closure. The work presented in this paper achieves timing closure with an area overhead of about 15.87% through useful clock skew optimization.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SATA.2016.7593032","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on VLSI Systems, Architectures, Technology and Applications (VLSI-SATA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on VLSI Systems, Architectures, Technology and Applications (VLSI-SATA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7586733/7593023/07593032.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SATA.2016.7593032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593023","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clock skew optimized VLSI architecture for zero frequency filter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593032","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clock skew optimized VLSI architecture for zero frequency filter","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593032/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408336","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593032/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clock skew optimized VLSI architecture for zero frequency filter","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"PaperID08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063321S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7586733","isNumber":"7593023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7586733","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7593023","articleId":"7593032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593037,"authors":[{"name":"Vikas Kumar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India"],"firstName":"Vikas","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37085847326"},{"name":"Kailash Chandra Ray","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India"],"firstName":"Kailash Chandra","lastName":"Ray","id":"37301796900"},{"name":"Preetam Kumar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India"],"firstName":"Preetam","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37382692600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0033-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0037-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7593037","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CORDIC-based VLSI architecture for implementing CI-OFDM and its FPGA prototype","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593037","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","OFDM","Field programmable gate arrays","Generators","Baseband","Mathematical model","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic","field programmable gate arrays","intercarrier interference","interferometry","OFDM modulation","satellite communication","signal processing","VLSI","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coordinate rotational digital computer","CORDIC-based VLSI architecture","carrier interferometry orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","CI-OFDM architecture","peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR","intercarrier symbol interference","ISI","real time wireless communication","satellite communication","orthogonal subcarriers","data symbols","FPGA device XC3S500E-5FG320","Matlab simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CI-OFDM","CORDIC","VLSI Architecture","FPGA Prototyping"]}],"abstract":"Since decades, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been drawing its attention in the area of wireless and satellite communication systems such as IEEE 802.11 a/g/n, ADSL, WiMAX and DVB-T/SH. In these applications, OFDM has drawbacks of high Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and Inter carrier symbol interference (ISI). Recently, Carrier Interferometry OFDM (CI-OFDM) as an alternative to OFDM is being studied to minimize the aforesaid drawbacks. To the knowledge of authors, there is no Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) prototyping of CI-OFDM is addressed for real time wireless and satellite communication system.

In CDMA system, a procedure used by a Mobile Station (MS) to search for the best cell site and achieve code, time, and frequency synchronization with it is referred as cell search. Fast cell search is essential to reduce switch on delay (initial cell search), increase stand by time (idle mode search) and maintain good link quality (active-mode search). This is particularly true for the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access-Frequency Division Duplex (W-CDMA-FDD) system since it employs nonsynchronous base stations instead of synchronous ones of other CDMA systems to extend coverage from outdoor to indoor. Cell search is critical for achieving code and time synchronization. The main process of achieving cell search is divided into three stages followed by code verification, tracking and carrier frequency adjustment: 1) slot synchronization, 2) frame synchronization and code group identification, 3) primary scrambling code identification. This paper addresses slot synchronization in downlink as cell search algorithm in W-CDMA. In the three step search, the receiver searches for the slot timing by correlating the received signal with the Primary Synchronization (PSCH) code using Matched Filter (MF). This paper propose a design for a hierarchical matched filter for Primary Synchronization Code (PSC). The aim is to reduce the hardware complexity using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) logic resources required to realize the filter.","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SATA.2016.7593051","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on VLSI Systems, Architectures, Technology and Applications (VLSI-SATA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on VLSI Systems, Architectures, Technology and Applications (VLSI-SATA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7586733/7593023/07593051.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SATA.2016.7593051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593023","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance enhancement of slot synchronization in W-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593051","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance enhancement of slot synchronization in W-CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593051/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408350","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593051/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance enhancement of slot synchronization in W-CDMA","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"PaperID27.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039951S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7586733","isNumber":"7593023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7586733","xplore-issue":"7593023","articleId":"7593051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593056,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Finally the same algorithm is modeled using Verilog HDL and implemented using ALTERA QUARTUS-II.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real time watermarking of grayscale images using integer DWT transform","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on VLSI Systems, Architectures, Technology and Applications (VLSI-SATA)","doi":"10.1109/VLSI-SATA.2016.7593056","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on VLSI Systems, Architectures, Technology and Applications (VLSI-SATA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7586733/7593023/07593056.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSI-SATA.2016.7593056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Jan. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Real time watermarking of grayscale images using integer DWT transform","conferenceDate":"10-12 Jan. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593056/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408353","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time watermarking of grayscale images using integer DWT transform","confLoc":"Bengaluru, India","sourcePdf":"PaperID32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069749S","chronDate":"10-12 Jan. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7586733","isNumber":"7593023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7586733","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7593023","articleId":"7593056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593065,"authors":[{"name":"M.

After adapting the metric to the FSK waveforms, EXIT chart performance results are extended and compared to short packet lengths using extensive Bit Error Rate (BER) computations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Detectors","Frequency shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency shift keying","modulation coding","radio receivers","turbo codes","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["turbo-FSK EXIT chart optimization","low power wide area network","LPWA network","link budget","physical layer","frequency shift keying modulation","FSK modulation and coding","turbo receiver","extrinsic information transfer chart analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low Power Wide Area","LPWA","Internet of Things","PHY-layer","FSK","Turbo Code","Low Rate","Low SNR","Machine-to-Machine","EXIT Chart"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593074","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593074.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EXIT chart optimization of Turbo-FSK: Application to Low Power Wide Area networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"EXIT chart optimization of Turbo-FSK: Application to Low Power Wide Area networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593074/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593074/","accessionNumber":"16397717","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EXIT chart optimization of Turbo-FSK: Application to Low Power Wide Area networks","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570262620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053817S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7593076,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Steiner","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Methoden der Signalverarbeitung, Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Fabian","lastName":"Steiner","id":"38468786200"},{"name":"Patrick Schulte","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technical University of Munich"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Schulte","id":"37085665050"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593076","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":310},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["AWGN","Wireless sensor networks","Channel coding","Optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","AWGN channels","binary codes","channel capacity","channel coding","error statistics","evolutionary computation","minimax techniques","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust protograph based LDPC code design","robust protograph based low-density parity check code","rate adaptive communication","probabilistic amplitude shaping","PAS","bitwise demapper","binary decoder","specific spectral efficiency","SE","bit-interleaved coded modulation bit channel","BIeM bit channel","min-max approach","differential evolution","16 amplitude shift keying constellation","ASK constellation","frame error rate","continuous AWGN capacity"]}],"abstract":"In this work, the design of robust, protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes for rate-adaptive communication via probabilistic shaping is considered.

One is the more common parallel serial MAP architecture (PSMAP) and the other is the XMAP architecture.

MS often results in an overestimation of the log likelihood ratio (LLR) in particular in the early stage of the iterative process. A linear post-processing is usually performed as a compensation. With regular low density parity check codes (LDPC), a fixed scaling of the LLR yields sufficiently good results. In contrast, adaptive strategies are mandatory with irregular codes. It is well known that the scaling factor is an increasing function of the reliability of the LLR. In most of the publications, the scaling factor is envisioned as a function of both the iteration number and the signal-to-noise ratio. It is proposed here to use the mutual information between extrinsics as a measure of the reliability of the LLR. A practical implementation is derived with reasonable complexity. Compared to the literature, the proposed method yields slightly better results in terms of BER and a significant reduction in the number of iterations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593079/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16408419","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593079/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Min-Sum decoding of irregular LDPC codes with adaptive scaling based on mutual information","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Min-Sum decoding of irregular LDPC codes with adaptive scaling based on mutual information","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570269003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056862S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593079","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593081,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Sandgren","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Sandgren","id":"37085899492"},{"name":"Alexandre Graell i Amat","affiliation":["Chalmers tekniska hogskola, Goteborg, SE"],"firstName":"Alexandre Graell","lastName":"i Amat"},{"name":"Fredrik Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","id":"37283169100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593081","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","decoding","delays","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite frame length analysis","asymptotic analysis","frame asynchronous coded slotted ALOHA","FA-CSA","frame-synchronous CSA","density evolution","asymptotic performance","spatially-coupled codes","analytical approximations","finite frame length regime"]}],"abstract":"We consider a frame-asynchronous coded slotted ALOHA (FA-CSA) system where users join according to a Poisson random process. In contrast to standard frame-synchronous CSA (FS-CSA), when a user joins the system, it transmits a first replica of its message in the following slot and other replicas uniformly at random in a number of subsequent slots. We derive the (approximate) density evolution that characterizes the asymptotic performance of FA-CSA when the frame length goes to infinity. We show that, if the receiver can monitor the system before users start transmitting, a boundary effect similar to that of spatially-coupled codes occurs, which greatly improves the decoding threshold as compared to FS-CSA. We also derive analytical approximations of the error floor (EF) in the finite frame length regime. We show that FA-CSA yields in general lower EF, better performance in the waterfall region, and lower average delay, as compared to FS-CSA.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593081","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593081.pdf","startPage":"81","endPage":"85","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic and finite frame length analysis of frame asynchronous coded slotted ALOHA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic and finite frame length analysis of frame asynchronous coded slotted ALOHA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593081/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16408427","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593081/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic and finite frame length analysis of frame asynchronous coded slotted ALOHA","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570269267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051452S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593082,"authors":[{"name":"Huixiao Ma","affiliation":["All Optics Lab, Shenzhen, P.

This paper investigates the use of systematic polar codes in a distributed source coding application. A system model is proposed for the compression of distributed sources with side information at the decoder, along with a theoretical approach for estimating the ideal compression ratio. The system performance is assessed in terms of compression efficiency and bit error rate, for different code parameters and source correlation levels. Simulation results show the efficiency of systematic polar codes in distributed source coding, which makes them suitable for practical distributed compression applications such as wireless sensor networks and distributed video coding. Furthermore, despite the fact that error correction performance of polar codes improves with larger blocks, results show that for a compression rate below 0.4 (i.e. compression stronger than 2.5:1), better error rates can be achieved with smaller blocks.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593084","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","startPage":"96","endPage":"100","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593084.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Systematics","Source coding","Decoding","AWGN","MATLAB"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","error correction","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed compression","correlated sources","systematic polar codes","near-capacity channel codes","turbo codes","distributed source coding","compression ratio","bit error rate","code parameters","source correlation levels","distributed source coding","wireless sensor networks","distributed video coding","error correction performance","error rates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["channel coding","compression","distributed source coding","entropy","systematic polar codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Distributed compression of correlated sources using systematic Polar Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593084/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593084/","accessionNumber":"16397739","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed compression of correlated sources using systematic Polar Codes","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570269688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05672S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7593085,"authors":[{"name":"Sudarsan V.

Usually, an RC code family supports successively lower code rates by sending specific increments of additional redundancy at each rate. That is, the order of the increments is fixed. However, in some multi-hop communication systems and also in recently proposed inter-frame coding, the order in which the decoder of the RC code receives the increments is not predetermined. A different ordering of the increments at the decoder may change the codes of various rates. This paper seeks RC codes that are universally good over all increment orderings. We call RC codes satisfying this requirement universal for any increment ordering (UIO) codes. We design protograph-based Raptor-like (PBRL) low-density parity-check (LDPC) code ensembles for UIO codes using protograph thresholds as components of two design metrics. One metric seeks codes that, at each code rate, have exactly the same frame error rate for all increment orderings. The other metric sacrifices strictly identical performance for every ordering to seek codes that achieve the best possible throughput in a variable-length setting with random increment ordering, as would occur with inter-frame coding. Simulation results of UIO-PBRL codes from the new ensembles show that our designs satisfy the two metrics.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593085/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16397748","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593085/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Universal rate-compatible LDPC code families for any increment ordering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal rate-compatible LDPC code families for any increment ordering","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570269699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049127S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593085","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7593086,"authors":[{"name":"Eirik Rosnes","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Simula Research Lab, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Eirik","lastName":"Rosnes","id":"37272234600"},{"name":"Michael Helmling","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics ITWM, Kaiserslautern, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Helmling","id":"37888189000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593086","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crime","Signal to noise ratio","Customer relationship management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","binary codes","decoding","dynamic programming","linear codes","linear programming","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive linear programming decoding","nonbinary linear code","prime field","constant-weight embedding","single parity-check code","SPC code","linear complexity","binary code","dynamic programming","adaptive LP decoder","general nonSPC linear code","ALP decoding algorithm"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we study linear programming (LP) decoding of nonbinary linear codes over prime fields.

The algorithm has linear (in the length of the SPC code) complexity, is structurally different from the one for binary codes, and is based on the principle of dynamic programming. Furthermore, it is the basis of the proposed efficient (relaxed) adaptive LP (ALP) decoder for general (non-SPC) linear codes over any prime field, generalizing the well-known ALP decoding algorithm for binary codes.

This receiver structure has been proposed for several scenarios, including systems for high order modulations, MIMO, ISI, and Multi User systems. It has been shown that the bit turbo-receiver provides performance close to the optimal receiver if the bit-detector EXIT chart \u201cmatches\u201d that of the outer code. Motivated by the observation that most bit-detector EXIT charts exhibit an almost linear behavior we then introduce the \u201cslope\u201d of the EXIT chart as a new parameter for the LDPC design. A family of binary LDPC codes having the possibility of tuning not only the rate, but also the slope of their EXIT chart, as well as the decoder complexity, is then an ideal candidate for being considered in future advanced transmission systems where the bit turbo-receiver will replace the more common BICM receiver that does not consider possible iterations with the bit detector. In this paper we provide an efficient algorithm for the design of LDPC codes ensembles with excellent performances with those constraints and derive some conclusions. It is shown that with a given performance threshold the complexity of LDPC decoder actually decreases when increasing the target slope, confirming the already observed fact that bit turbo-receiver requires weaker outer codes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593090","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593090.pdf","startPage":"126","endPage":"130","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of LDPC codes with tunable slope of their EXIT charts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design of LDPC codes with tunable slope of their EXIT charts","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593090/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408403","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593090/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of LDPC codes with tunable slope of their EXIT charts","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570270019.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034854S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593091,"authors":[{"name":"Flavio Zabini","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna"],"firstName":"Flavio","lastName":"Zabini","id":"37295109700"},{"name":"Gianni Pasolini","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna"],"firstName":"Gianni","lastName":"Pasolini","id":"37284735800"},{"name":"Andrea Conti","affiliation":["ENDIF, University of Ferrara"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Conti","id":"37266585500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593091","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion","Rate distortion theory","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","signal sampling","source coding","source separation","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["remote source coding","signal estimation","random sampling","stationary Gaussian source","homogeneous Poisson point process","homogeneous Poisson sampling","white noise","signal spectrum estimation","indirect source coding","overall distortion rate","bit rate constraint","distortion component","Poisson random sampling","band-limited signal","nonband-limited signal"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593091","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593091","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593091","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593091.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On remote source coding for signal estimation via Poisson sampling","abstract":"Remote source coding for signal estimation via random sampling is analyzed.

This confirms that the linear model can accurately predict the performance of LDPC codes in the high SNR region.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593100","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593100.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear model for the iterative decoding of random LDPC codes in the high SNR region","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A linear model for the iterative decoding of random LDPC codes in the high SNR region","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593100/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16408422","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593100/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear model for the iterative decoding of random LDPC codes in the high SNR region","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570270181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063078S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593102,"authors":[{"name":"Umar-Faruk Abdu-Aguye","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Environment, Plymouth University, Plymouth, UK"],"firstName":"Umar-Faruk","lastName":"Abdu-Aguye","id":"37085899383"},{"name":"Marcel Adrian Ambroze","affiliation":["University of Plymouth, Plymouth, Devon, GB"],"firstName":"Marcel Adrian","lastName":"Ambroze"},{"name":"Martin Tomlinson","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Environment, Plymouth University, Plymouth, UK"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Tomlinson","id":"37283995300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593102","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","cyclic codes","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved minimum weight girth and ACE distribution","short block length irregular LDPC code","PEG algorithm","cyclic PEG algorithm","CPEG algorithm","progressive edge-growth algorithm","edge establishment sequence","low-density parity-check code","approximate cycle extrinsic message degree","local ACE distribution","minimum codeword weight","minimum stopping set weight","local girth","ACE modified standard PEG","ACE modified CPEG standard"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate cycle extrinsinsic message degree (ACE)","edge connections sequence","girth","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","minimum distance","minimum stopping set weight","PEG algorithm","Tanner graph"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we introduce a novel progressive edge-growth (PEG) algorithm, the cyclic PEG (CPEG) algorithm.

ABP is a multistage BP based decoder that uses a backtracking processing when decoding fails. The algorithm proceeds in two main steps, namely a symbol selection step and an augmented decoding step. The former is based on a criterion related both to the stopping subgraph connectivity and to the input reliability, while the latter can be either implemented using a list based or a greedy approach. Compared to the original implementation, we consider a different approach for both steps. First, the proposed node selection is only based on the dynamic of sign changes of the extrinsic messages at the variable nodes output. This enables us to consider indifferently general memoryless channels, while still taking into account the graph irregularity. Then, we propose a simple yet efficient implementation of the augmented decoding procedure based on pruning of the branching tree The proposed algorithm shows near maximum likelihood decoding performance while decreasing the overall complexity (computation and memory) of the original algorithm. Moreover, complexity-performance trade-off is an built-in feature for this kind of algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Belief propagation","Complexity theory","Algorithm design and analysis","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","failure analysis","graph theory","maximum likelihood decoding","parity check codes","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified augmented belief propagation","general memoryless channel","ABP algorithm","low-density parity-check code","multistage BP-based decoder","backtracking processing","decoding failure","symbol selection step","augmented decoding step","stopping graph connectivity","input reliability","list based approach","greedy approach","graph irregularity","branching tree pruning","maximum likelihood decoding performance","overall complexity reduction","complexity-performance trade-off"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593103","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593103","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593103.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593103","startPage":"191","endPage":"195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified augmented belief propagation for general memoryless channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modified augmented belief propagation for general memoryless channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593103/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593103/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397716","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified augmented belief propagation for general memoryless channels","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570270385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056944S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7593104,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9dric Marchand","affiliation":["Lab-STICC (UMR 6285), Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Sud, Lorient, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9dric","lastName":"Marchand","id":"37408122500"},{"name":"Emmanuel Boutillon","affiliation":["Lab-STICC (UMR 6285), Universit\u00e9 de Bretagne Sud, Lorient, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Boutillon","id":"37085891570"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593104","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":203},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593104","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Standards","Degradation","Switches","Lead","Decoding","Bridges","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parity check codes","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NB-LDPC check node","nonbinary low-density parity-check code","reliability criteria","extended min-sum check node processing","EMS check node processing","syndrome based algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NB-LDPC","Check Node","syndrome-based","EMS"]}],"abstract":"Non-binary low-density parity-check codes have better communication performance compared to their binary counterparts but they suffer from higher complexity, especially for the check node processing.

In this paper, we propose an integer form of stochastic computation and introduce some elementary circuits.

Among them, the interleave division multiple access (IDMA) and low-density spreading CDMA (LDS-CDMA) are of special interest because of their overloading capability. In this paper, we present a unified system structure that encompasses both systems. We call this unified structure as codeword interleaved LDS CDMA (cILDS-CDMA) and present an iterative decoding structure. We analyze the decoder performance via an EXIT-chart like approach and demonstrate the advantage of low density (sparse) spreading. Numerical results in AWGN channel show that LDS reduces the decoding latency and the cILDS-CDMA scheme also offer a larger diversity gain in frequency selective fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593111/","accessionNumber":"16397730","displayDocTitle":"Overloaded multiple access systems: A generalized model and a low-complexity multiuser decoder","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overloaded multiple access systems: A generalized model and a low-complexity multiuser decoder","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570270504.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041436S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593113,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Tajan","affiliation":["IMS UMR 5218, Univ. of Bordeaux, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Romain","lastName":"Tajan","id":"37712509000"},{"name":"Charly Poulliat","affiliation":["INPT-ENSEEIHT/IRIT, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Charly","lastName":"Poulliat","id":"37269105300"},{"name":"Marie-Laure Boucheret","affiliation":["INPT-ENSEEIHT/IRIT, University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Laure","lastName":"Boucheret","id":"38491572500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593113","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":278},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Computer architecture","Conferences","Correlation","Modulation","Intersymbol interference","Niobium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","linear codes","receivers","transmitters","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low complexity transmitter architecture","low complexity receiver architecture","circular faster than Nyquist communication","circular convolution","turbo-equalization scheme","linear MMSE equalization","time compression factor","equalizer complexity","FTN system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593113","abstract":"In this article, we propose low complexity transmitter and receiver architectures for Faster Than Nyquist communications.

A joint design of bit-interleaver and the polar code is then proposed. The core of the design is to intensify the channel polarization of polar coding by viewing the BICM channel as a set of equivalent subchannels with possibly different capacities.

The symbols are read by measuring a single bit from the symbol in each read step, starting from the most significant bit. An error event occurs when not all the symbol bits are known, e.g., due to a premature termination of the read sequence. To deal with such error events, we propose the use of GF(q) low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and analyze their iterative-decoding performance. In particular, we show how to exploit the algebraic structure of the QBMC channel for efficient analysis, and study the effect of the Tanner graph's edge-label distribution on the decoding performance. It is shown that for q = 4 the optimal correction of single-bit erasures is achieved by a distribution different from the uniform distribution on the non-zero elements of GF(4).","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593117","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593117.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","startPage":"261","endPage":"265","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC codes for the q-ary bit-measurement channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"LDPC codes for the q-ary bit-measurement channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593117/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397724","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593117/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC codes for the q-ary bit-measurement channel","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570270777.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078457S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593119,"authors":[{"name":"Cheng Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Services Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, P.

Similar to other locally repairable codes (LRCs), the presented codes are suitable for applications that require a low repair locality. The novelty that we introduce in our construction is that we relax the strict requirement the repair locality to be a fixed small number l, and we allow the repair locality to be either l or l + 1. This gives us the flexibility to construct BLRCs for arbitrary values of n and k which partially solves the open problem of finding a general construction of LRCs. Additionally, the relaxed locality criteria gives us an opportunity to search for BLRCs that have a low repair locality even when double failures occur. We use metrics such as a storage overhead, an average repair bandwidth, a Mean Time To Data Loss (MTTDL) and an update complexity to compare the performance of BLRCs with existing LRCs.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593121","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593121","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593121.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balanced locally repairable codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Balanced locally repairable codes","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593121/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397738","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593121/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balanced locally repairable codes","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570270955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065416S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7593122,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Tigr\u00e9at","affiliation":["Electronics Department, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Tigr\u00e9at","id":"37085860209"},{"name":"Carlos Rosar Kos Lassance","affiliation":["IMT Atlantique Bretagne-Pays de Loire, Brest, Bretagne, FR"],"firstName":"Carlos Rosar Kos","lastName":"Lassance","id":"37086435146"},{"name":"Xiaoran Jiang","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes"],"firstName":"Xiaoran","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086048032"},{"name":"Vincent Gripon","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Gripon","id":"37591295000"},{"name":"Claude Berrou","affiliation":["Electronics Department, T\u00e9l\u00e9com Bretagne"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Berrou","id":"37269008100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593122","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","Hamming codes","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["assembly output code","learning neural network","neural network-based classifier","completely disjoint code","binary vector","coding theory","assembly code","higher minimum Hamming distance","classification performance","clustered clique-based network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Assembly coding","Clustered Clique Networks","ECOC","Deep Learning","Coding theory","Classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593122","abstract":"Neural network-based classifiers usually encode the class labels of input data via a completely disjoint code, i.e. a binary vector with only one bit associated with each category.

In [1], the authors showed the utility of projecting the signal on a basis of the modulation alphabet, looking for the sparsest vector representation. As an extension of this work and in order to reduce the detection complexity, we present first an equivalent real-valued formulation of the optimization problem, all the more interesting as the modulation order is high. Then we consider an outer forward error correcting (FEC) code and we propose a turbo detection scheme. We focus on the medium SNR value range where detection errors involve adjacent symbols. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a sparse vector formulation to be treated as a soft detection output that can be directly exploited in a symbol-to-binary conversion to feed the FEC decoder with reliable soft input. The FEC decoder output will be exploited to provide a priori information within the detection criterion based on a regularization approach. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed scheme in comparison with reference schemes of the state-of-art.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593123.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"294","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593123","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593123","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo detection based on sparse decomposition for massive MIMO transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Reliability","Convolutional codes","Detectors","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction","MIMO communication","modulation coding","signal detection","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse decomposition","massive MIMO transmission","massive MIMO detection problem","QAM constellation","modulation alphabet","sparsest vector representation","detection complexity reduction","optimization problem","forward error correcting code","FEe decoder","turbo detection scheme","soft detection output","symbol-to-binary conversion","regularization approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["sparse representation","source separation","massive MIMO","turbo-detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593123/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Turbo detection based on sparse decomposition for massive MIMO transmission","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593123/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408404","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo detection based on sparse decomposition for massive MIMO transmission","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570271113.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072502S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593123","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593124,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Abdmouleh","affiliation":["Universite de Bretagne-Sud, Lorient, FR"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Abdmouleh"},{"name":"Emmanuel Boutillon","affiliation":["Universite de Bretagne Sud, Lab-STICC (UMR 6582), Lorient, France"],"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Boutillon","id":"37281706400"},{"name":"Laura Conde-Canencia","affiliation":["Universite de Bretagne Sud, Lab-STICC (UMR 6582), Lorient, France"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Conde-Canencia","id":"38272782600"},{"name":"Charbel Abdel Nour","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Lab-STICC (UMR 6582), Brest, France"],"firstName":"Charbel","lastName":"Abdel Nour","id":"37589344600"},{"name":"Catherine Douillard","affiliation":["Telecom Bretagne, Lab-STICC (UMR 6582), Brest, France"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Douillard","id":"37269013300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593124","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":211},"abstract":"This paper is dedicated to the optimisation of Non-Binary LDPC codes when associated to high-order modulations.

This peculiar behavior has been observed in the finite codeword length regime, where the noise perturbating the decoder dynamics help to escape the attraction of fixed points such as trapping sets. In this paper, we will study two recently introduced LDPC decoders derived from noisy versions of the gradient descent bit-flipping decoder (GDBF). Although the GDBF is known to be a simple decoder with limited error correction capability compared to more powerful softdecision decoders, it has been shown that the introduction of a random perturbation in the decoder could greatly improve the performance results, approaching and even surpassing belief propagation or min-sum based decoders. For both decoders, we evaluate the probability of escaping from a Trapping set, and relate this probability to the parameters of the injected noise distribution, using a Markovian model of the decoder transitions in the state space of errors localized on isolated trapping sets. In a second part of the paper, we present a modified scheduling of our algorithms for the binary symmetric channel, which allows to approach maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) at the cost of a very large number of iterations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408417","htmlLink":"/document/7593125/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Noise-aided gradient descent bit-flipping decoders approaching maximum likelihood decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise-aided gradient descent bit-flipping decoders approaching maximum likelihood decoding","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570271120.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062799S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593129,"authors":[{"name":"Amina Piemontese","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Amina","lastName":"Piemontese","id":"37085905696"},{"name":"Alexandre Graell i Amat","affiliation":["Chalmers tekniska hogskola, Goteborg, SE"],"firstName":"Alexandre Graell i","lastName":"Amat"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593129","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content management","mobile radio","network coding","radio networks","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content downloading","download time reduction","download delay","BS","base station","device-to-device communication","mobile device","content storage","wireless network reliability","maximum distance separable coded DS","low-delay wireless content delivery","MDS-coded distributed storage"]}],"abstract":"We address the use of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes for distributed storage (DS) to enable efficient content delivery in wireless networks.

Our analysis shows that MDS-coded DS can dramatically reduce the download time with respect to the reference scenario where content is always downloaded from the BS.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593129","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593129.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MDS-coded distributed storage for low delay wireless content delivery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593129/","displayDocTitle":"MDS-coded distributed storage for low delay wireless content delivery","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408418","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593129/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MDS-coded distributed storage for low delay wireless content delivery","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570271133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071794S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593130,"authors":[{"name":"Fran\u00e7ois Leduc-Primeau","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, Canada"],"firstName":"Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Leduc-Primeau","id":"38273560300"},{"name":"Warren J.

The vision calls for a paradigm shift in the design and operation of wireless access schemes to enable efficient and reliable massive connectivity with many channel collisions occurring when (uncoordinated) multiple MTC devices concurrently access a shared wireless channel. Motivated by recent results in information theory, this paper proposes a promising approach to the massive access problem by combining the concept of network densification (i.e., ultra-dense deployment of base stations) with physical-layer network coding and pulse-shaped (filtered) OFDM as the most promising air-interface for 5G. The basic idea is to exploit channel collisions at nearby base stations to reliably decode linear equations of transmitted messages. The linear equations are then forwarded through the backbone to a macro base station that solves a system of linear equations to reconstruct the original messages.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","startPage":"335","endPage":"339","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593132.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Harnessing channel collisions for efficient massive access in 5G networks: A step forward to practical implementation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Mathematical model","Reliability","Decoding","Parity check codes","OFDM","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","cellular radio","Internet of Things","network coding","OFDM modulation","radio access networks","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel collision","massive access","5G network","fifth generation cellular network","massive machine type communication","MTC device","wireless spectrum","Internet of Things","wireless access scheme","shared wireless channel","information theory","network densification concept","physical-layer network coding","pulse-shaped OFDM","air-interface","decode linear equation","macro base station","original message reconstruction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Harnessing channel collisions for efficient massive access in 5G networks: A step forward to practical implementation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593132/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593132/","accessionNumber":"16397727","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Harnessing channel collisions for efficient massive access in 5G networks: A step forward to practical implementation","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570272435.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091307S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7593133,"authors":[{"name":"Nurul H.

In spite of the potential benefits of C-RAN, the operational costs are still a challenging issue, mainly due to the centralized processing scheme and the large number of operating remote radio head (RRH) connecting to the cloud. In this work we consider a setup in which a C-RAN is powered partially with a set of renewable energy sources (RESs), our aim is to minimize the processing/backhauling costs at the cloud center as well as the transmission power at the RRHs, while satisfying some user quality of service (QoS). This problem is first formulated as a mixed integer non linear program (MINLP) with a large number of optimization variables. The underlying NLP is non-convex, though we address this issue through reformulating the problem using the mean squared error (MSE)-rate relation. To account to the large-scale of the problem, we introduce slack variables to decompose the reformulated (MINLP) and enable the application of a distributed optimization framework by using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","startPage":"375","endPage":"379","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593140.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint beamforming and network topology optimization of green cloud radio access networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593140/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593140/","displayDocTitle":"Joint beamforming and network topology optimization of green cloud radio access networks","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397722","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint beamforming and network topology optimization of green cloud radio access networks","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570283918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060782S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7593141,"authors":[{"name":"Gayan Amarasuriya","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Southern Illinois University"],"firstName":"Gayan","lastName":"Amarasuriya","id":"37394070900"},{"name":"Rafael F.

A secondary (cognitive) multi-user massive MIMO system is underlaid within a primary (licensed) multi-user massive MIMO system. A passive multi-antenna eavesdropper is eavesdropping upon either the primary or secondary transmission. To this end, physical layer secure transmissions are provisioned for both primary and secondary systems by exploiting linear precoders and artificial noise (AN) generation. The excess degrees-of-freedom at the primary massive MIMO base-station are exploited to transmit the AN sequence by using random AN shaping matrices for the purpose of degrading the signal decodability at the eavesdropper. Achievable asymptotic secrecy rates for infinitely many base-station antennas are derived, and these secrecy rates are shown to be independent of the eavesdropper channels. Moreover, for infinitely many secondary base-station antennas, the secondary system becomes independent of the primary system allowing it to operate at its maximum transmission power without disturbing the primary system.","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593141","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593141.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure transmission in cognitive massive MIMO systems with underlay spectrum sharing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593141/","displayDocTitle":"Secure transmission in cognitive massive MIMO systems with underlay spectrum sharing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408409","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593141/","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure transmission in cognitive massive MIMO systems with underlay spectrum sharing","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570284116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057194S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593141","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593144,"authors":[{"name":"Di Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering University of Rostock"],"firstName":"Di","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085812626"},{"name":"Volker Kuehn","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering University of Rostock"],"firstName":"Volker","lastName":"Kuehn","id":"37530885800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3401-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3400-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3402-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2165-4719"}],"articleNumber":"7593144","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":553},"abstract":"Content caching has been recently shown to be an efficient way to increase the Spectral Efficiency (SE) or Energy Efficiency (EE) of the network, as well as to reduce the burden on backhaul links. In this paper, the network design for the downlink of multicast Cache-Enabled Fog Radio Access Network (F-RAN) is investigated, where Radio Units (RUs) equipped with cache modules form different clusters to serve different multicast groups by Cooperative Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission. We aim to maximize the minimum scaled (weighted) SINR among all multicast groups for fairness, which depends on the associated user with the worst-case SINR. Moreover, load-balancing among backhauls is taken into account in order to meet their individual capacity constraints. Hence, based on the channel states, requested and cached files as well as individual capacities of backhaul links, a joint optimization of clustering formulation and multicast beamforming is required, so as to achieve the weighted Max-Min Fairness (wMMF) of the network. We show that this problem can be solved efficiently by combining the solution of a related power consumption minimization problem with the Bi-Section method. Numerical results show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587668/7593064/07593144.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"399","publicationTitle":"2016 9th International Symposium on Turbo Codes and Iterative Information Processing (ISTC)","doi":"10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTC.2016.7593144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593064","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593144","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Weighted Max-Min Fairness oriented load-balancing and clustering for multicast Cache-Enabled F-RAN","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Gain","3GPP","Fading channels","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cache storage","channel capacity","cooperative communication","minimax techniques","minimisation","multicast communication","pattern clustering","power consumption","radio access networks","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast cache-enabled F-RAN","weighted max-min fairness oriented load-balancing","weighted max-min fairness oriented clustering","content caching","spectral efficiency","SE","energy efficiency","EE","backhaul link burden reduction","multicast cache-enabled fog radio access network","radio unit","RU","cooperative multipoint transmission","CoMP transmission","minimum scaled SINR maximization","multicast group","capacity constraint","clustering formulation and multicast beamforming joint optimization","wMMF","power consumption minimization problem","bisection method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Weighted Max-Min Fairness oriented load-balancing and clustering for multicast Cache-Enabled F-RAN","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593144/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408402","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Weighted Max-Min Fairness oriented load-balancing and clustering for multicast Cache-Enabled F-RAN","confLoc":"Brest, France","sourcePdf":"1570288788.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046853S","chronDate":"5-9 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587668","isNumber":"7593064","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587668","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7593064","articleId":"7593144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593145,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel J.

Finally, a deep understanding of the strong interrelation of code structure, decoding algorithms, communications performance and efficient implementation in state-of-the-art semiconductor technology is mandatory.

Previously, material on ferroelectric, pyroelectric, and electrooptical materials had comprised a large portion of the chapter. However, a \"Bibliography of Ferroelectrics\" by Toyoda is published several times a year in the journal Ferroelectrics. Sections covering the periods, March-June 1975 (1) and July-December 1975 (2) appeared this year. Lang publishes an annual \"Literature Guide to Pyroelectricity\" containing a review and a key-word-in-context index in Ferroelectrics. This year's index covered the years 1974- 1975 (3). The literature in electrooptics is included in a separate chapter in the Digest of Literature on Dielectrics. It is believed that these other areas are now adequately covered and that only piezoelectricity should be included in this chapter. The literature used in preparing this review was found by use of Chemical Abstracts~ Science Abstracts~ several computerizedretrieval services, as well as by a study of the major journals. A total of more than 600 references, the majority having appeared in 1976 with a small number from 1975, were found. Out of this total, 271 were selected for review. The material not reviewed included reports for government agencies, relatively inaccessible nonEnglish language publications, more than 75 Japanese patents, and more than 20 Russian patents. Abstracts of all the patents can be found in Chemical Abstracts. The proceedings of two major conferences, published in their entirety in Ferroelectrics~ were a rich source of papers on piezoelectricity and related topics. These conferences were the 1975 IEEE Symposium on Applications of Ferroelectrics held in Albuquerque, New Mexico on 9-11 June 1975 and the Third European Conference on Ferroelectricity held in Zurich, Switzerland on 22-26 September 1975. A large number of papers on applications of electroacoustics were presented at the IEEE Ultrasonics Symposium held in Los Angeles, California on 22-24 September 1975.

Since the rapid growth of the amount of the PV systems in recent year has greatly affected the stability of the power system, the grid codes demand the grid-connected PV systems to have the low-voltage ride through (LVRT) capability to help sustaining the stability of power system especially during the grid faults. To satisfy the LVRT requirements and ensure the injected current within the safety value, the active and reactive power commands are calculated by using the current profile of the LVRT grid requirements and the current limit of the inverter. Moreover, the proposed RFCMANN controller uses the signed distance and input space repartition mechanisms to convert the dual-input variables to sole-input variable and repartition the input space to an appropriate quantity. Therefore, the structure and computation complexities of the proposed RFCMANN controller are effectively reduced and make it more practical. Furthermore, varied learning-rate coefficients are designed to guarantee the convergence of the tracking error for the proposed RFCMANN controller.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2618882","startPage":"1258","endPage":"1268","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7812803/07593213.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2618882","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7812803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recurrent Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Neural Network Based Power Control of a Single-Stage Three-Phase Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System During Grid Faults","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Reactive power","Maximum power point trackers","Neural networks","Power system stability","Power quality","Aerospace electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cerebellar model arithmetic computers","fuzzy control","neurocontrollers","photovoltaic power systems","power generation control","power generation faults","power grids","power system stability","reactive power control","recurrent neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recurrent fuzzy cerebellar model articulation neural network-based power control","single-stage three-phase grid-connected photovoltaic system","power grid fault","RFCMANN-based controller","reactive power regulation","active power regulation","single-stage three-phase grid-connected PV system","power system stability","low-voltage ride through capability","LVRT capability","power system safety","computation complexity","tracking error convergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grid faults","low-voltage ride through (LVRT)","maximum power point tracking (MPPT)","photovoltaic (PV) system","reactive power control","recurrent fuzzy cerebellar model articulation neural network (RFCMANN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593213/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Neural Network Based Power Control of a Single-Stage Three-Phase Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System During Grid Faults","volume":"64","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7593213/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16584963","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Neural Network Based Power Control of a Single-Stage Three-Phase Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System During Grid Faults","sourcePdf":"tie-lin-2618882-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100201S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7812803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7812803","articleId":"7593213","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7593216,"authors":[{"name":"Emeshaw Ashenafi","affiliation":["Computer Science Electrical Engineering Department, University of Missouri Kansas-City, Kansas City, MO, USA"],"firstName":"Emeshaw","lastName":"Ashenafi","id":"37085873518"},{"name":"Masud H.

Most of the power gating techniques utilize sleep transistors in different configurations to reduce the subthreshold leakage current, which is the primary source of the standby power. These sleep transistors, which are added between the supply lines and the circuits as header and footer switches, impose additional area, delay, power, and other overheads and complexities. This brief introduces the concept of combining the functionality of the sleep transistors with the logic devices by utilizing fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) device. This FDSOI transistor-based power gating circuit design approach will eliminate the requirement of employing a separate set of sleep transistors to place the circuit in the sleep or idle mode. This will reduce the overall complexity and overheads of integrated circuits and simplify power gating techniques. In addition, it improves the overall power efficiency and lower thermal effects. SOI devices are becoming critically important for various very-large-scale integration applications, because SOI devices provide higher performance and reliability, and options to design circuits with multiple-threshold voltages to ensure faster switching and lower power consumption. In the proposed circuit design approach, the flexibility to control the threshold voltage of a double-gate FDSOI device via back gate has been exploited to eliminate the need for using a separate set of sleep transistors. The presented sleep transistor design is verified via HSPICE simulation using the Leti-UTSOI model from CEA-Leti.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2618768","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2618768","startPage":"1074","endPage":"1078","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8423543/07593216.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8423543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Power Gating Circuit Design Approach Using Double-Gate FDSOI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A New Power Gating Circuit Design Approach Using Double-Gate FDSOI","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2018","accessionNumber":"17989822","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7593216/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Power Gating Circuit Design Approach Using Double-Gate FDSOI","sourcePdf":"tcsii-ashenafi-2618768-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07018S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8423543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8423543","articleId":"7593216","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593221,"authors":[{"name":"Kilho Lee","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kilho","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0003-3651-0427","id":"37086031072"},{"name":"Daehyeok Kim","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Daehyeok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086036887"},{"name":"Insik Shin","affiliation":["School of Computing, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Insik","lastName":"Shin","id":"37086038726"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7593221","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","IP networks","Wireless networks","Packet loss","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio networks","telecommunication traffic","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["REboost","wireless networks","traffic redundancy elimination","bandwidth limited networks","TCP congestion control","TCP packet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Traffic redundancy elimination (RE)","deduplication","congestion control","packet loss","link delay"]}],"abstract":"Traffic redundancy elimination (RE) is an attractive approach to improve the throughput in bandwidth-limited networks. While previous studies show that the RE is useful for improving the throughput in such networks, we observed that the RE would not be an effective solution in wireless networks. We found the TCP congestion control cannot take advantage of the RE, without knowing how the underlying RE system manipulates each TCP packet. In this letter, we present a novel technique called REboost to enable the TCP layer to be aware of the underlying RE system and improve the throughput. Our evaluation with a prototype shows that REboost significantly improves the throughput compared with the previous RE systems.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618798","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7809126/07593221.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"$\\mathsf{REboost}$ : Improving Throughput in Wireless Networks Using Redundancy Elimination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593221","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"$\\mathsf{REboost}$ : Improving Throughput in Wireless Networks Using Redundancy Elimination","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593221/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16597855","htmlLink":"/document/7593221/","volume":"21","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"BSRP","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1D1A1A01058713"},{"fundingName":"IITP","grantNumber":"B0101-15-0557"},{"fundingName":"NCRC","grantNumber":"2010-0028680"},{"fundingName":"NRF","grantNumber":"2015M3A9A7067220"},{"fundingName":"Korea Government","grantNumber":"MEST/MSIP/MOTIE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"$\\mathsf{REboost}$ : Improving Throughput in Wireless Networks Using Redundancy Elimination","sourcePdf":"lcomm-shin-2618798-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051404S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7809126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7809126","articleId":"7593221","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":7593223,"authors":[{"name":"Konglin Zhu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7593223/zhu-2618940-small.gif","p":["Konglin Zhu received the master\u2019s degree in computer science from UCLA and the Ph.D. degree from the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 2009 and 2014, respectively.

The data caching is introduced in D2D networks to enable the quick data access in mobile networks. Due to the selfish nature of users, they wish to get as much replication as possible in the opportunistic connections, seeking to maximize their own profits. However, caching data for other nodes may result in additional cost to the node serving as cache, where the cost is invoked by the cache placement of cache nodes and accessing cost of other nodes. In this paper, we propose a social-aware caching game to incentivize nodes to cache data for others. In the game, we consider the social ties and physical distance as the factors to formulate the caching cost. We obtain the Nash equilibrium of the game and propose a social-aware algorithm to minimize the total cost of getting object data in the network.

Several transmission technologies and precoding techniques have been developed in order to exploit the spatial dimension so that simultaneous transmission of independent data streams reuse the same radio resources. The achievable performance of such techniques heavily depends on the channel characteristics of the selected users, the amount of channel knowledge, and how efficiently interference is mitigated. In systems where the total number of receivers is larger than the number of total transmit antennas, user selection becomes a key approach to benefit from multiuser diversity and achieve full multiplexing gain. The overall performance of MU-MIMO systems is a complex joint multi-objective optimization problem since many variables and parameters have to be optimized, including the number of users, the number of antennas, spatial signaling, rate and power allocation, and transmission technique. The objective of this literature survey is to provide a comprehensive overview of the various methodologies used to approach the aforementioned joint optimization task in the downlink of MU-MIMO communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2016.2618870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2016.2618870","startPage":"239","endPage":"284","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7862305/07593225.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Overview on Resource Allocation Techniques for Multi-User MIMO Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"An Overview on Resource Allocation Techniques for Multi-User MIMO Systems","volume":"19","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16691080","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7593225/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Portuguese Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e Tecnologia FCT/MEC through national funds, PURE-5GNET and VELOCE-MTC","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Overview on Resource Allocation Techniques for Multi-User MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"comst-castaneda-2618870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.600132S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7862305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"7862305","articleId":"7593225","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593229,"authors":[{"name":"Jianfeng Li","affiliation":["Array and Information Processing Laboratory, College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianfeng","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-4055-7017","id":"37086018195"},{"name":"Defu Jiang","affiliation":["Array and Information Processing Laboratory, College of Computer and Information, Hohai University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Defu","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37086023163"},{"name":"Xiaofei Zhang","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaofei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279338600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7593229","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1821},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Covariance matrices","MIMO radar","Multiple signal classification","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combined unitary estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique based algorithm","coprime multiple-input multiple-output radar","direction of arrival estimation","coprime MIMO radar","combined unitary ESPRIT","DOA estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO radar","coprime array","DOA estimation","unitary ESPRIT"]}],"abstract":"Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for coprime multiple-input multiple-output radar is studied, and a combined unitary estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique (ESPRIT)-based algorithm is proposed. The transmitter and the receiver adopt coprime arrays, which are sparse but still uniform. Therefore, unitary ESPRIT is first used to obtain arbitrary ambiguous DOA estimations based on the rotational invariances of transmit and receive arrays, respectively. After recovering all the other estimations, unique DOA estimation is achieved by finding the coincide results from transmit and receive arrays based on the coprimeness. The proposed algorithm obtains more accurate DOA estimation, achieves higher angle resolution, and identifies more targets than conventional methods.

Novel nonvolatile memories (NVMs), such as phase change memory and spin-transfer torque random access memory, can provide fast read/write operations. In this paper, we propose a unified NVM/flash architecture to improve the I/O performance. A transparent scheme, virtualized flash (vFlash), is also proposed to manage the unified architecture. Within vFlash, interapp and intra-app techniques are proposed to optimize the application performance by exploiting the historical locality and I/O access patterns of applications. Since vFlash is on the bottom of the I/O stack, the application features will be lost. Therefore, we also propose a cross-layer technique to transfer the application information from the application layer to the vFlash layer. The proposed scheme is evaluated based on an Android platform, and the experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve the I/O performance of mobile devices.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2016.2618881","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2016.2618881","startPage":"1203","endPage":"1214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7951135/07593233.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"vFlash: Virtualized Flash for Optimizing the I/O Performance in Mobile Devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"vFlash: Virtualized Flash for Optimizing the I/O Performance in Mobile Devices","volume":"36","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16970052","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7593233/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"GRF 152138/14E and GRF 15222315/15E"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272103, 61373049, 61502309, 61309004 and 61572331"},{"fundingName":"National 863 Program","grantNumber":"2013AA013202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004377","fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"4-ZZD7, G-YK24, G-YM10 and GYN36"},{"fundingName":"Chongqing High-Tech Research Program","grantNumber":"cstc2016jcyjA0332"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030313553, 2013B090500055, 2014A030310269 and 2016A030313045"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Science and Technology Foundation","grantNumber":"JCYJ20150529164656096 and JCYJ20150525092941059"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of SZU","grantNumber":"201534 and 2015/827-000073"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"vFlash: Virtualized Flash for Optimizing the I/O Performance in Mobile Devices","sourcePdf":"tcad-chen-2618881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114208S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7951135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7951135","articleId":"7593233","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593236,"authors":[{"name":"Pritam Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Pritam Mukherjee received his B.

In each case, we establish the optimal sum secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) by providing achievable schemes and matching converses. We show that the unavailability of the eavesdropper's channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) does not reduce the s.d.o.f. of the wiretap channel with helpers. However, there is loss in s.d.o.f. for both the multiple access wiretap channel and the interference channel with an external eavesdropper. In particular, we show that in the absence of eavesdropper's CSIT, the K-user multiple access wiretap channel reduces to a wiretap channel with (K - 1) helpers from a sum s.d.o.f. perspective, and the optimal sum s.d.o.f. reduces from K(K-1) /K(K-1)+1 to K-1 K . For the interference channel with an external eavesdropper, the optimal sum s.d.o.f. decreases from K(K-1) /2K-1 to K-1/ 2 in the absence of the eavesdropper's CSIT. Our results show that the lack of eavesdropper's CSIT does not have a significant impact on the optimal s.d.o.f. for any of the three channel models, especially when the number of users is large. This implies that physical layer security can be made robust to the unavailability of eavesdropper CSIT at high signal-to-noise ratio regimes by the careful modification of the achievable schemes as demonstrated in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure Degrees of Freedom of One-Hop Wireless Networks With No Eavesdropper CSIT","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2016.2618725","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7855839/07593236.pdf","startPage":"1898","endPage":"1922","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2618725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855839","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593236","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/18/7855839/7593236-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Secure Degrees of Freedom of One-Hop Wireless Networks With No Eavesdropper CSIT","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"63","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7593236/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16669107","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS 13-14733, CCF 14-22111 and CCF 14-22129"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Secure Degrees of Freedom of One-Hop Wireless Networks With No Eavesdropper CSIT","sourcePdf":"tit-ulukus-2618725-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130831S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7855839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7855839","articleId":"7593236","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7593238,"authors":[{"name":"Ignacio Martin-Diaz","affiliation":["CA Telematica at DICIS, University of Guanajuato, Salamanca, Mexico","Escuela de Ingenier\u00edas Industriales, University of Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7931767/7593238/diaz-2618756-small.gif","p":["Ignacio Martin-Diaz (S'13) received the B.S. degree in\n industrial engineering from the Escuela de Ingenier\u00edas Industriales, University of Valladolid (UVA),\n Valladolid, Spain, in 2014.

Various artificial-intelligence-based approaches have been proposed to deal with a large amount of data obtained from destructive laboratory testing. However, in real applications, such volume of data is not always available due to the effort required in obtaining the predictors for classifying the faults. Therefore, in realistic scenarios, it is necessary to cope with the small-data problem, as it is known in the literature. Fault-related instances along with healthy state observations obtained from the IM compose datasets that are usually imbalanced, where the number of instances classified as the faulty class (minority) is much lower than those classified under the healthy class (majority). This paper presents a novel supervised classification approach for IM faults based on the adaptive boosting algorithm with an optimized sampling technique that deals with the imbalanced experimental dataset. The stator current signal is used to compose a dataset with features both from the time domain and from the frequency domain. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher performance metrics than others classifiers used in this field for the incipient detection and classification of faults in IM.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Rotors","Monitoring","Classification algorithms","Harmonic analysis","Bars","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","induction motors","sampling methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["early fault detection","induction motors","AdaBoost","imbalanced small data","optimized sampling","intelligent fault detection","supervised classification approach","IM faults","adaptive boosting algorithm","stator current signal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification algorithms","condition monitoring","data analysis","fault diagnosis","induction motors (IMs)","rotors","sampling methods"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIA.2016.2618756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/7931767/07593238.pdf","startPage":"3066","endPage":"3075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7931767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2016.2618756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Early Fault Detection in Induction Motors Using AdaBoost With Imbalanced Small Data and Optimized Sampling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593238","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Early Fault Detection in Induction Motors Using AdaBoost With Imbalanced Small Data and Optimized Sampling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593238/","volume":"53","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May-June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7593238/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16898631","dateOfInsertion":"19 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003141","fundingName":"Mexican Council of Science and Technology (CONACyT)","grantNumber":"598078"},{"fundingName":"Universidad Autonoma de Queretaro"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006054","fundingName":"Universidad de Guanajuato, DAIP","grantNumber":"733/2016"},{"fundingName":"Universidad de Valladolid"},{"fundingName":"Universidad de Valladolid for doctoral students"},{"fundingName":"Universidad de Valladolid"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad"},{"fundingName":"Proyectos I+D del Subprograma de Generaci\u00f3n de Conocimiento, Programa Estatal de Fomento de la Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y T\u00e9cnica de Excelencia","grantNumber":"DPI2014-52842-P"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Early Fault Detection in Induction Motors Using AdaBoost With Imbalanced Small Data and Optimized Sampling","sourcePdf":"tia-romerotroncoso-2618756-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079065S","chronDate":"May-June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7931767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7931767","articleId":"7593238","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":7593240,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos A.

However, BD is not easily translated to frequency-selective channels, since space-time information must be included in the transceiver design. In this paper, we demonstrate that BD is possible in frequency-selective MIMO broadcast channels to eliminate inter-user interference and derive the conditions on the number of transmit antennas and the transmission block length (as functions of the number of users and channel delay spread) for the existence of BD precoders. We also propose three different approaches to mitigate/eliminate inter-symbol interference in block transmissions: time-reversal-based BD (TRBD), equalized BD (EBD), and joint processing BD (JPBD). We show that any transmit-processing-only method (including TRBD and EBD) yields zero diversity and multiplexing gains (high SNR regime). We also demonstrate that JPBD, which uses linear processing at the transmitter and the receiver, approximates full multiplexing gain for a sufficiently large transmit block length, and show its diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. Extensive numerical simulations show that the achievable rate and probability of error performance of all the proposed techniques remarkably improve that of conventional time-reversal beamforming. Moreover, JPBD provides the highest achievable rate region for frequency-selective MIMO broadcast channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

The approximant numerator is computed by means of genetic algorithm (GA) tools and a square error criterion. As a result, an optimal approximant of lower order is derived. To show its performances, to highlight some important of its characteristics, and to conclude to its efficiency, a comparative study is carried out.

SDN has the capability to adapt its network parameters on the fly based on its operating environment. The decoupled structure of SDN serves as a solution for managing the network with more flexibility and ease. In SDN, the centralized cost effective architecture provides network visibility which helps to achieve efficient resource utilization and high performance. Due to the increasingly pervasive existence of smart programmable devices in the network, SDN provides security, energy efficiency, and network virtualization for enhancing the overall network performance. We present various security threats that are resolved by SDN and new threats that arise as a result of SDN implementation. The recent security attacks and countermeasures in SDN are also summarized in the form of tables. We also provide a survey on the different strategies that are implemented to achieve energy efficiency and network security through SDN implementation. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this new paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts, challenges, and research trends in this area. With this paper, readers can have a more thorough understanding of SDN architecture, different security attacks and countermeasures, and energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2016.2618874","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7862305/07593247.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"346","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7862305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2016.2618874","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software Defined Networking Architecture, Security and Energy Efficiency: A Survey","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593247","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/9739/7862305/7593247-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2017","displayDocTitle":"Software Defined Networking Architecture, Security and Energy Efficiency: A Survey","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593247/","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16691061","htmlLink":"/document/7593247/","volume":"19","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000144","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) CAREER","grantNumber":"CNS-1650831"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000144","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1658972"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Software Defined Networking Architecture, Security and Energy Efficiency: A Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-rawat-2618874-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.223429S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7862305","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"161","xplore-issue":"7862305","articleId":"7593247","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593248,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey Loyka","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Sergey Loyka was born in Minsk, Belarus.

A closed-form solution for an optimal transmit covariance matrix is obtained when the channel is strictly degraded.

The cases of weak eavesdropper and high SNR are considered. It is shown that the optimal covariance does not converge to a scaled identity in the high-SNR regime. Necessary optimality conditions and a tight upper bound on the rank of an optimal covariance matrix are established for the general case, along with a lower bound to the secrecy capacity, which is tight in a number of scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2016.2618857","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7748579/07593248.pdf","startPage":"7207","endPage":"7215","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2618857","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7748579","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Signaling for Secure Communications Over Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593248","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593248/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Signaling for Secure Communications Over Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels","volume":"62","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16465918","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593248/","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Signaling for Secure Communications Over Gaussian MIMO Wiretap Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-loyka-2618857-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117982S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7748579","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7748579","articleId":"7593248","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7593250,"authors":[{"name":"Fahimeh Farahnakian","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, University of Turku, Turku, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8731803/7593250/farah-2617374-small.gif","p":["Fahimeh Farahnakian received the MS degree in computer engineering from the University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran.

Many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to tackle the VM consolidation as a vector bin-packing problem. However, the existing algorithms have focused mostly on the number of active Physical Machines (PMs) minimization according to their current resource requirements and neglected the future resource demands. Therefore, they generate unnecessary VM migrations and increase the rate of Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations in data centers. To address this problem, we propose a VM consolidation approach that takes into account both the current and future utilization of resources. Our approach uses a regression-based model to approximate the future CPU and memory utilization of VMs and PMs. We investigate the effectiveness of virtual and physical resource utilization prediction in VM consolidation performance using Google cluster and PlanetLab real workload traces. The experimental results show, our approach provides substantial improvement over other heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms in reducing the energy consumption, the number of VM migrations and the number of SLA violations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593250/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2019","volume":"7","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"18737353","dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2019","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2019","htmlLink":"/document/7593250/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware VM Consolidation in Cloud Data Centers Using Utilization Prediction Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Aware VM Consolidation in Cloud Data Centers Using Utilization Prediction Model","sourcePdf":"tcc-farahnakian-2617374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.225859S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2019","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8731803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"8731803","articleId":"7593250","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2019","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593251,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Gutjahr","affiliation":["BMW Group Research and Technology, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7935171/7593251/gutja-2614705-small.gif","p":["Benjamin Gutjahr received the degrees from Universit\u00e4t Stuttgart, Germany; University of Connecticut, USA; and Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway, all in engineering cybernetics, and the Dipl.-Ing. degree in 2012.

The optimization problem is solved by means of a linear time-varying model predictive control scheme that generates trajectories for path following under consideration of various time-varying system constraints in a receding horizon fashion. Formulating the system dynamics linearly in combination with a quadratic cost function has two great advantages. First, the system constraints can be set up not only to achieve collision avoidance with both static and dynamic obstacles, but also aspects of human driving behavior can be considered. Second, the optimization problem can be solved very efficiently, such that the algorithm can be run with little computational effort. In addition, due to an elaborate problem formulation, reference curves with discontinuous, high curvatures will be effortlessly smoothed out by the algorithm. This makes the proposed algorithm applicable to different traffic scenarios, such as parking or highway driving.

In our proposed scheme, the periodicity and the symmetry of the cyclic spectrum will be exploited to establish a concise feature representation of multiple graphs. The modulated signal is first transformed from the cycle-frequency domain into the graph domain. Consequently, the concise graph-presentation, namely, a set of weighted directed rings, will be formulated as the robust features of the original signal. Those features can be easily expressed by the corresponding adjacency matrices. It can be verified that the adjacency matrices are sparse and the non-zero entries therein can be registered as the efficient feature parameters. Through the Hamming distance measure to enumerate the difference between the feature parameters resulting from the training data and the test data, one can perform the modulation classification. Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve much better classification accuracy than the existing technique when the cyclic spectrum is used.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618868","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7809126/07593256.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"19","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Innovative Robust Modulation Classification Using Graph-Based Cyclic-Spectrum Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Innovative Robust Modulation Classification Using Graph-Based Cyclic-Spectrum Analysis","volume":"21","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593256/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16597817","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593256/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61601091"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China","grantNumber":"ZYGX2015J121"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006952","fundingName":"Louisiana Board of Regents Pilot Fund and OPT-IN Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Innovative Robust Modulation Classification Using Graph-Based Cyclic-Spectrum Analysis","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wu-2618868-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084539S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7809126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7809126","articleId":"7593256","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593257,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaoquan Zeng","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7862305/7593257/zeng-2618841-small.gif","p":["Zhaoquan Zeng received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2013, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of British Columbia, Kelowna, BC, Canada, in 2015.

Therefore, we focus, in this paper, on the UOWC that employs optical wave as the transmission carrier. In recent years, many potential applications of UOWC systems have been proposed for environmental monitoring, offshore exploration, disaster precaution, and military operations. However, UOWC systems also suffer from severe absorption and scattering introduced by underwater channels. In order to overcome these technical barriers, several new system design approaches, which are different from the conventional terrestrial free-space optical communication, have been explored in recent years.

The two fundamental physical differences from conventional sub-6-GHz cellular systems are: 1) vulnerability to blocking and 2) the need for significant directionality at the transmitter and/or receiver, which is achieved through the use of large antenna arrays of small individual elements. We overview and compare models for both of these factors, and present a baseline analytical approach based on stochastic geometry that allows the computation of the statistical distributions of the downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and also the per link data rate, which depends on the SINR as well as the average load. There are many implications of the models and analysis: 1) mmWave systems are significantly more noise-limited than at sub-6 GHz for most parameter configurations; 2) initial access is much more difficult in mmWave; 3) self-backhauling is more viable than in sub-6-GHz systems, which makes ultra-dense deployments more viable, but this leads to increasingly interference-limited behavior; and 4) in sharp contrast to sub-6-GHz systems cellular operators can mutually benefit by sharing their spectrum licenses despite the uncontrolled interference that results from doing so. We conclude by outlining several important extensions of the baseline model, many of which are promising avenues for future research.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2618794","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2618794","startPage":"403","endPage":"430","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7818052/07593259.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818052","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Analyzing Millimeter Wave Cellular Systems","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7818052/7593259-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Analyzing Millimeter Wave Cellular Systems","volume":"65","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16598311","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7593259/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CIF-1514275"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Modeling and Analyzing Millimeter Wave Cellular Systems","sourcePdf":"tcomm-andrews-2618794-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.288702S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7818052","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"316","xplore-issue":"7818052","articleId":"7593259","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593264,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Chen","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Industrial Control Technology College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/8246762/7593264/chen-2618886-small.gif","p":["Jian Chen (M\u201906\u2013SM\u201910) received the B.E. degree in\n detection technology and instrumentation and the M.E. degree in control science and engineering from Zhejiang\n University, Hangzhou, China, in 1998 and 2001, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from\n Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA, in 2005.","From 2006 to 2008, he was a Research Fellow with the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, where he was\n involved in fuel cell modeling and control.

Specifically, we research the problem of estimating the mobile doubly selective channels for the IEEE 802.11p orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based communication. To mitigate some of the major challenges imposed by the time-varying vehicular environments and to solve this estimation problem a new standard-compliant channel estimator block is proposed. The estimator structure is an innovative construct stemming from the idea of subcarrier frequencies self-organization, which leverages intersubbands connections through decision directed feedback, spectral smoothing, and time tracking. Comparisons between the new method and existing alternatives already indicate that the proposed scheme outperforms the latter. Furthermore, the bit error rate (BER) and frame error rate (FER) performance of the new estimator is close to the one with perfect channel state information for low and medium SNRs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2016.2612886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7956367","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7956367/07593266.pdf","endPage":"1942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Self-Organizing Frequency Approach to 802.11p Channel Estimation","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2016.2612886","startPage":"1930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593266","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Self-Organizing Frequency Approach to 802.11p Channel Estimation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593266/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16969458","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7593266/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"18","issue":"7","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU Project HIGHTS","grantNumber":"656537 and H2020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Self-Organizing Frequency Approach to 802.11p Channel Estimation","sourcePdf":"tits-stoica-2612886-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087718S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7956367","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7956367","articleId":"7593266","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":7593272,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Setting a relatively large period, the considered systems are capable of approximating the general S-MJLSs (without any requirements on sojourn-time PDFs) for which numerically testable stability and stabilization conditions are rather difficult to obtain. Necessary and sufficient criterion for mean square stability of the general S-MJLSs is first derived, which involves an infinite number of conditions and as such not checkable. However, the developments lay a foundation to further establish the numerically testable conditions for the systems when the PDF of sojourn time is EMP albeit the sojourn time can tend to infinity. The derivations explicitly depend on the PDF of sojourn time, which circumvents the difficulty in obtaining the memory transition probabilities of S-MJLSs. The adopted Lyapunov function is sojourn-time-dependent (STD), by which the existence conditions of STD controller are developed as well using certain techniques that can eliminate the terms of power of matrices in the stability conditions. Two illustrative examples including a class of population ecological systems are presented to show the validity and applicability of the developed theoretical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593281/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16918099","volume":"62","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7593281/","publicationDate":"June 2017","dateOfInsertion":"25 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Stability and Stabilization of Semi-Markov Jump Linear Systems With Exponentially Modulated Periodic Distributions of Sojourn Time","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61322301"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of Heilongjiang","grantNumber":"F201417 and JC2015015"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities, China","grantNumber":"HIT.BRETIII.201211, HIT.BRETIV.201306 and HIT.MKSTISP.2016.32"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability and Stabilization of Semi-Markov Jump Linear Systems With Exponentially Modulated Periodic Distributions of Sojourn Time","sourcePdf":"tac-zhang-2618844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103036S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7934112","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"7934112","articleId":"7593281","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7593283,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard F.

The requirements are two orthogonal polarizations with good purity and suitability of the array column for 1-D beamforming applications. Since single-layer fabrication without using vertical interconnection accesses is another important requirement, the chosen radiating elements are square microstrip patches, fed at two orthogonal edges. The array feeding is designed in series microstrip line fashion, providing a highly compact structure. In that way, 1-D beamforming agility is gained, when multiple array columns are arranged side by side and the individual columns are fed with appropriate phases. The sidelobe level of the array columns is decreased by implementing an amplitude taper within the series array, following the Dolph-Chebychev distribution. A fast scattering parameter calculation procedure is presented to achieve an efficient simulation and design process. The simulated and measured antenna properties are very stable over a bandwidth of 500 MHz around the center frequency proving that such a challenging dual-polarized design can be successfully implemented at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies with just one metallization layer on a grounded substrate. The design parameters and the design procedure are demonstrated in a step by step manner to give sufficient insight into the process together with the possibility of reusing the antenna array itself, as well as the underlying concepts.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2618847","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7803621/07593283.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7803621","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2618847","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"142","endPage":"149","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Planar Dual-Polarized Microstrip 1-D-Beamforming Antenna Array for the 24-GHz Band","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593283","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Planar Dual-Polarized Microstrip 1-D-Beamforming Antenna Array for the 24-GHz Band","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593283/","volume":"65","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7593283/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16581745","dateOfInsertion":"02 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy","grantNumber":"KF3151001NT3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Planar Dual-Polarized Microstrip 1-D-Beamforming Antenna Array for the 24-GHz Band","sourcePdf":"tap-hamberger-2618847-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059813S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7803621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7803621","articleId":"7593283","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7593284,"authors":[{"name":"Kun Yan","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory of Wireless Wideband Communication & Signal Processing, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Kun","lastName":"Yan","id":"37086180216"},{"name":"Hsiao-Chun Wu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"firstName":"Hsiao-Chun","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-0178-1246","id":"37292236100"},{"name":"Hailin Xiao","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory of Wireless Wideband Communication & Signal Processing, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Hailin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37085526377"},{"name":"Xiangli Zhang","affiliation":["Guangxi Key Laboratory of Wireless Wideband Communication & Signal Processing, Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Xiangli","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38666505900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7593284","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":903},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal detection","Signal to noise ratio","Laplace equations","Quantization (signal)","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","AWGN","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","Monte Carlo methods","signal detection","signal representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust band-limited signal detection approach","graph-based adequate-concise information representation paradigm","signal representation framework","communication signals","graph-based signal characterization","Monte Carlo simulation","graph-based signal detection method","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph representation","cyclic spectral analysis","sparse signal","weak signal detection"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a novel graph-based adequate and concise information representation paradigm is explored.

According to Monte Carlo simulation results, the proposed graph-based signal detection method leads to the outstanding performance, compared with other existing techniques especially when the signal-to-noise ratio is rather small.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618871","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7809126/07593284.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"23","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Robust Band-Limited Signal Detection Approach Using Graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Novel Robust Band-Limited Signal Detection Approach Using Graphs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593284/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16597849","htmlLink":"/document/7593284/","volume":"21","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"NSFC 61163060, NSFC 61261034 and NSFC 61261018"},{"fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Wireless Wideband Communication & Signal Processing","grantNumber":"12202 and 12105"},{"fundingName":"Guangxi Province, Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Ministry of Education"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006952","fundingName":"Louisiana Board of Regents OPT-IN program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Robust Band-Limited Signal Detection Approach Using Graphs","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wu-2618871-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052706S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7809126","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7809126","articleId":"7593284","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593285,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Cheng Zhong","affiliation":["EHF Key Laboratory of Fundamental Science, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7769172/7593285/zhong-2618849-small.gif","p":["Yi Chen Zhong (SM\u201914) received the B.S. degree from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2009, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include phase shift surface, nondiffraction beams, and near-field focusing antennas."]},"firstName":"Yi Cheng","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37086133383"},{"name":"Yu Jian Cheng","affiliation":["EHF Key Laboratory of Fundamental Science, School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7769172/7593285/cheng-2618849-small.gif","p":["Yu Jian Cheng (SM\u201914) was born in Sichuan, China, in 1983.

The theory and transfer functions of the realized 2-D lattice DAFs are derived. Some variations of the 2-D lattice structure are also presented. We use the Roesser state space model to verify the minimal realization of the proposed 2-D recursive lattice DAF. We present a least-squares design technique and a minimax design technique to solve the nonlinear optimization problems of the proposed 2-D lattice DAF structure. The novelty of the presented lattice structure is that it not only inherits the desirable attributes of 1-D Gray-Markel lattice allpass structure but also possesses the advantage of better performance over the existing 2-D lattice allpass structures.

This phenomenon may be caused by multiple spatial or temporal factors (e.g., 3-D field solvers discretizations and multirate circuit simulation), nonlinearity of devices and circuits, large number of design or optimization parameters (e.g., full-chip routing/placement and circuit sizing), or extensive process variations (e.g., variability /reliability analysis and design for manufacturability). The computational challenges generated by such high-dimensional problems are generally hard to handle efficiently with traditional EDA core algorithms that are based on matrix and vector computation. This paper presents \u201ctensor computation\u201d as an alternative general framework for the development of efficient EDA algorithms and tools. A tensor is a high-dimensional generalization of a matrix and a vector, and is a natural choice for both storing and solving efficiently high-dimensional EDA problems. This paper gives a basic tutorial on tensors, demonstrates some recent examples of EDA applications (e.g., nonlinear circuit modeling and high-dimensional uncertainty quantification), and suggests further open EDA problems where the use of tensor computation could be of advantage.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tensor Computation: A New Framework for High-Dimensional Problems in EDA","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2016.2618879","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7880730/07593292.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2016.2618879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7880730","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593292","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/43/7880730/7593292-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593292/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Tensor Computation: A New Framework for High-Dimensional Problems in EDA","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"36","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7593292/","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16756657","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF NEEDS Program"},{"fundingName":"AIM Photonics Program"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council","grantNumber":"17212315"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003802","fundingName":"University Research Committee of the University of Hong Kong"},{"fundingName":"MIT Greater China Fund for Innovation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Tensor Computation: A New Framework for High-Dimensional Problems in EDA","sourcePdf":"tcad-zhang-2618879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166869S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7880730","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7880730","articleId":"7593292","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7593295,"authors":[{"name":"Yingfeng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7904755/7593295/zhang-2618892-small.gif","p":["Yingfeng Zhang received the B.Eng., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in\n mechanical engineering, all from Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 1999, 2002, and 2005,\n respectively.","He is currently a Professor in the Department of Industrial Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University,\n Xi'an, China.

We consider the relaying communication between one secondary user (SU) source and one SU destination by using an opportunistic relay selection from multiple SU relays and sharing the licensed spectrum of multiple primary users (PUs) in the underlay network. While the transmission between the SUs imposes interference on each PU, the relayed transmission is intercepted by one SU eavesdropper. In the absence of the eavesdropper's channel state information, the relay selection is based on the largest channel gain of relay-to-destination link, which is assumed to be outdated due to feedback delay. We derive the exact probability of non-zero secrecy capacity and the exact secrecy outage probability (SOP) in the closed form. Furthermore, we derive the asymptotic SOP in two different cases, and explicitly show the effects of system parameters on the secrecy diversity order and the secrecy diversity gain, respectively. Both asymptotic analysis and simulation results show that the secrecy performance can be improved by increasing either the number of relays or the Nakagami parameter of the legitimate relay channels, whereas the secrecy diversity gain deteriorates as the number of the PUs increases.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2618793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07593296.pdf","startPage":"549","endPage":"563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2618793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secrecy Performance Analysis of Cognitive Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks in Nakagami- $m$ Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593296","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Secrecy Performance Analysis of Cognitive Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks in Nakagami- $m$ Fading Channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593296/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16669148","htmlLink":"/document/7593296/","volume":"65","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401165 and 61372129"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003392","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province","grantNumber":"2015J01262 and 2014J01243"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Funds for Distinguished Young Scholar","grantNumber":"2014A030306027"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003815","fundingName":"Promotion Program for Young and Middle-aged Teacher in Science and Technology Research of Huaqiao University","grantNumber":"ZQN-PY407"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secrecy Performance Analysis of Cognitive Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks in Nakagami- $m$ Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zhao-2618793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169889S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7593296","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593297,"authors":[{"name":"Wenhao Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Wenhao","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-3957-340X","id":"37085364995"},{"name":"Hans Mittelmann","affiliation":["School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Hans","lastName":"Mittelmann","id":"37401773100"},{"name":"Zhi Ding","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at Davis, Davis, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Ding","id":"37278651400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7593297","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":359},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593297","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Optimization","Rician channels","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Covariance matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","diversity reception","iterative methods","MIMO communication","modulation","optimisation","Rician channels","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterated local search method","quadratic 3D assignment problem","packet loss mitigation","Rician fading channel","MIMO-coordinated multipoint scenario","link throughput","packet loss rate reduction","modulation mappings","transmission enhancement technique","hybrid-automatic repeat request systems","MoDiv","modulation diversity","MIMO-CoMP HARQ","modulation design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MoDiv","MIMO","CoMP","HARQ","Q3AP"]}],"abstract":"Modulation diversity (MoDiv) is a simple and practical transmission enhancement technique that utilizes different modulation mappings to reduce packet loss rate and achieve higher link throughput.

The proposed architecture employs time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and phase interpolation techniques to reach a sampling rate, higher than the clock frequency (maximum 400 MHz), up to 1.2 GSa/s. The resulting FPGA ADC can achieve a 6 bit resolution (ENOB) over a 0.9 to 1.6 V input range and an effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW) of 15 MHz. This implies that the ADC has an effective Nyquist rate of 30 MHz, with an oversampling ratio of 40\u00d7. The system non-linearities are less than 1 LSB. The main advantages of this architecture are its scalability and reconfigurability, enabling applications with changing demands on one single platform.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2599927","startPage":"1854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7676403/07593301.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2599927","endPage":"1865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7676403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cryogenic 1 GSa/s, Soft-Core FPGA ADC for Quantum Computing Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593301/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Cryogenic 1 GSa/s, Soft-Core FPGA ADC for Quantum Computing Applications","volume":"63","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7593301/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"16411229","dateOfInsertion":"25 October 2016","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Cryogenic 1 GSa/s, Soft-Core FPGA ADC for Quantum Computing Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsi-homulle-2599927-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070161S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7676403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7676403","articleId":"7593301","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7593310,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7809129/7593310/liu-2606353-small.gif","p":["Yao Liu (S\u201916) Yao Liu received the B.Sc. and M.S. degrees from Fudan University, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

Circuit performance can be improved with some auxiliary modules such as analog circuits and post-processing components, which usually involve the compromising of cost, compatibility, throughput, and security as well. In some cases only sub-optimal designs can be achieved. In this paper, by utilizing the diverse timing characteristics of different initial states, a staged-running Self-timed Ring (STR) architecture, which is able to suppress the degree of bias, is proposed. The proposed architecture is compared with some conventional free-running architectures using a Xilinx Zynq-7000 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform for a throughput of 100 Mbps. With the increase of the ring size, the bias degree of the newly proposed structure is within a negligible level of less than 1%; whereas those of the conventional architectures can exceed 10%. Statistical tests were also conducted and the results show that the quality of randomness rises as the complexity in initial-state mapping and the ring nodes of the proposed structure increases. The test passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite with high p-values.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593310/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"16618478","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7593310/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Bias-Bounded Digital True Random Number Generator Architecture","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002920","fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"CityU 111913 and CityU 123612"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001692","fundingName":"Croucher Foundation Startup Allowance","grantNumber":"9500015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bias-Bounded Digital True Random Number Generator Architecture","sourcePdf":"tcsi-cheung-2606353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077696S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7809129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7809129","articleId":"7593310","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593313,"authors":[{"name":"Eddie Hung","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7951135/7593313/hung-2618862-small.gif","p":["Eddie Hung received the M.Eng. degree from the University of Bristol, Bristol, U.K., in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, in 2013.","He is currently the Technical Lead with Invionics, Vancouver, a startup offering a platform for building custom EDA tools.

Although assertions apply equally to hardware design, they are typically supported only for logic simulation, and discarded prior to physical implementation. We propose a new hardware design language-agnostic language for describing latency-insensitive assertions and novel methods to add such assertions transparently to an already placed-and-routed circuit without affecting the existing design. We also describe how this language and associated methods can be used to implement semi-transparent exception handling. The key to this paper is that by treating hardware assertions and exceptions as being oblivious or less sensitive to latency, assertion logic need only use spare FPGA resources. We use network-flow techniques to route necessary signals to assertions via spare flip-flops, eliminating any performance degradation, even on large designs (92% of slices in one test). Experimental evaluation shows zero impact on critical-path delay, even on large benchmarks operating above 200 MHz, at the cost of a small power penalty.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2016.2618862","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7951135/07593313.pdf","startPage":"1193","endPage":"1202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2016.2618862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951135","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593313","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transparent In-Circuit Assertions for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593313/","displayDocTitle":"Transparent In-Circuit Assertions for FPGAs","volume":"36","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7593313/","publicationDate":"July 2017","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","accessionNumber":"16970061","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"U.K. EPSRC","grantNumber":"EP/I012036/1, EP/N031768/1 and EP/L00058X/1"},{"fundingName":"European Union Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme","grantNumber":"671653"},{"fundingName":"Maxeler University Programme"},{"fundingName":"Intel PSG"},{"fundingName":"Xilinx"},{"fundingName":"HiPEAC NoE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transparent In-Circuit Assertions for FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tcad-hung-2618862-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107362S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7951135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7951135","articleId":"7593313","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7593316,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Liu","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086337999"},{"name":"Xun Chen","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xun","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086157431"},{"name":"Rabab K.

However, due to the patch-based manner applied in sparse coding, most existing SR-based fusion methods suffer from two drawbacks, namely, limited ability in detail preservation and high sensitivity to misregistration, while these two issues are of great concern in image fusion. In this letter, we introduce a recently emerged signal decomposition model known as convolutional sparse representation (CSR) into image fusion to address this problem, which is motivated by the observation that the CSR model can effectively overcome the above two drawbacks. We propose a CSR-based image fusion framework, in which each source image is decomposed into a base layer and a detail layer, for multifocus image fusion and multimodal image fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed fusion methods clearly outperform the SR-based methods in terms of both objective assessment and visual quality.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2618776","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2016.2618776","startPage":"1882","endPage":"1886","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7604153/07593316.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7604153","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Fusion With Convolutional Sparse Representation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Image Fusion With Convolutional Sparse Representation","volume":"23","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16490818","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593316/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007458","fundingName":"Qatar Foundation"},{"fundingName":"National Priorities Research Program","grantNumber":"7-684-1-127"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Fusion With Convolutional Sparse Representation","sourcePdf":"lsp-liu-2618776-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094166S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7604153","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"271","xplore-issue":"7604153","articleId":"7593316","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7593318,"authors":[{"name":"Gangtao Han","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Gangtao","lastName":"Han","id":"37085832547"},{"name":"Zheng Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37076184500"},{"name":"Jian-Kang Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Jian-Kang","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0003-0203-7918","id":"37281463700"},{"name":"Xiaomin Mu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiaomin","lastName":"Mu","id":"37287621700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7593318","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":672},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593318","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading channels","Coherence","Modulation","Uplink","Antennas","Channel models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal binary modulation division","two-user uplink massive MIMO systems","noncoherent ML detection","base station","Rayleigh fading","small scale channel fading","noncoherent maximum likelihood receiver","channel orthogonality approximation","fast decoding algorithm","exact bit error probability formula","BEP formula","closed-form optimal power loading","computer simulations","signal-to-noise ratio region"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","orthogonal binary modulation division","noncoherent ML detection"]}],"abstract":"This letter considers a noncoherent two-user uplink system, where each user has a single antenna and a base station is equipped with a large number of antennas. It is assumed that small scale channel fading is Rayleigh fading and quasi-static in two consecutive time slots and changes to other values independently in the next block. For such massive MIMO uplink system, we propose an orthogonal binary modulation scheme and utilize a noncoherent maximum likelihood receiver rather than a commonly adopted channel orthogonality approximation to analyze its error performance. A fast decoding algorithm is obtained and an exact bit error probability (BEP) formula is derived. When the large scale fading coefficients are available at the transmitters, a closed-form optimal power loading is attained that minimizes a tight upper bound of BEP. Computer simulations demonstrate that in a mild signal-to-noise ratio region, the optimized upper bound is almost equal to the truly optimized BEP. Hence, our derived BEP formula can be used to quantify how many antennas we need for the given BEP. In addition, the extension of all these results to the system with coherence time longer than two is also briefly discussed.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618787","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2618787","startPage":"294","endPage":"297","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7849238/07593318.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Binary Modulation Division for Two-User Uplink Massive MIMO Systems With Noncoherent ML Detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593318/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Binary Modulation Division for Two-User Uplink Massive MIMO Systems With Noncoherent ML Detection","volume":"21","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668411","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7593318/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271421, 61301150 and 61571401"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"NSERC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Binary Modulation Division for Two-User Uplink Massive MIMO Systems With Noncoherent ML Detection","sourcePdf":"lcomm-zhang-2618787-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120379S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7849238","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7849238","articleId":"7593318","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":7593323,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Kang","affiliation":["Fert Beijing Institute, BDBC, and School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang Univeristy, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7809129/7593323/kang-2606438-small.gif","p":["Wang Kang (S\u201912, M\u201915) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in microelectronics from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2009 and in 2015, respectively.

To deal with the read reliability challenge, we propose herein a dynamic dual-reference sensing (DDRS) scheme. The key features of the proposed DDRS scheme include: (a) two reference signals, generated by two reference cells with the same structures as those of the data cells, are provided to the sensing circuit; (b) the reference signals are adaptively dynamical depending on the content stored in the target data cell; (c) two output signals are obtained to decide the sensing result, adding redundancy for supporting self-error detection (SED) capability. The proposed DDRS scheme can achieve a great improvement in sensing margin (SM) and bit error rate (BER), in comparison with conventional sensing schemes. In addition, no regularity problems exist in the proposed DDRS scheme, as the reference cells maintain exactly the same structures as those of the data cells. Our simulation results show that the proposed DDRS scheme can achieve a ~ 7\u00d7 increase in average SM, and a ~ 70% reduction in average BER, compared with conventional sensing schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2606438","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7809129/07593323.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809129","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2606438","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Dual-Reference Sensing Scheme for Deep Submicrometer STT-MRAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593323","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Dual-Reference Sensing Scheme for Deep Submicrometer STT-MRAM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593323/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16618485","htmlLink":"/document/7593323/","volume":"64","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M570024 and 2016T90025"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501013 and 61571023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005081","fundingName":"Beijing Municipal of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"D15110300320000"},{"fundingName":"111 talent program","grantNumber":"B16001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Dual-Reference Sensing Scheme for Deep Submicrometer STT-MRAM","sourcePdf":"tcsi-zhao-2606438-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115544S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7809129","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7809129","articleId":"7593323","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593328,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Badr","affiliation":["University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Ahmed Badr (S\u201910) received the B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Cairo University, Egypt in 2007, Nile University, Egypt in 2009 and University of Toronto, Canada in 2014.

In our setup, the encoder observes a stream of source packets in a sequential fashion, and M channel packets must be transmitted between the arrival of successive source packets. Each channel packet can depend on all the source packets observed up to and including that time, but not on any future source packets. The decoder must reconstruct the source stream with a delay of T packets. We consider a class of packet erasure channels with burst and isolated erasures, where the erasure patterns are locally constrained. Our proposed model provides a tractable approximation to statistical models, such as the Gilbert-Elliott channel, for capacity analysis. When M = 1, i.e., when the source-packet arrival and channel-packet transmission rates are equal, we establish upper and lower bounds on the capacity, that are within one unit of the decoding delay T. We also establish necessary and sufficient conditions on the column distance and column span of a convolutional code to be feasible, and in turn establish a fundamental tradeoff between these. Our proposed codes-maximum distance and span codes- achieve a near-optimal tradeoff between the column distance and column span, and involve a layered construction. When M > 1, we establish the capacity for the burst-erasure channel and an achievable rate in the general case. Extensive numerical simulations over Gilbert-Elliott and Fritchman channel models suggest that our codes also achieve significant gains in the residual loss probability over statistical channel models.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2016.2618924","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2618924","startPage":"111","endPage":"141","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7792231/07593328.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7792231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered Constructions for Low-Delay Streaming Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Layered Constructions for Low-Delay Streaming Codes","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2016","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593328/","accessionNumber":"16636501","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593328/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ontario Early Researcher Award"},{"fundingName":"Canada Research Chair Program"},{"fundingName":"Hewlett Packard through a HP-IRP Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered Constructions for Low-Delay Streaming Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-khisti-2618924-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.18374S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7792231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7792231","articleId":"7593328","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":7593330,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiyun Yu","affiliation":["Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7593330/yu-2607766-small.gif","p":["Ruiyun Yu received the B.S. degree in fluid transmission and control, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer application technology from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 1997, 2004, and 2009, respectively.

Location-based services are widely used with the development of wireless communication and mobile Internet technology. A number of popular spatial-temporal cloaking technologies have been proposed, and the number of users in an anonymizing spatial region (ASR) is uncontrollable. This paper, based on the semi-trusted server architecture proposes a location cloaking algorithm (LCA) based on combinatorial optimization. First, the semi-trusted server architecture divides the information of mobile users into three parts, so adversaries are unable to obtain the location and identity at the same time, then utilize the spatial k -anonymity algorithm LCA to hide the real locations of user, which controls the number of real users to around k in the anonymous result sets (Aset), so that both the number of users in ASR and the area of ASR are minimized, thereby improving query precision and decreasing the resources consumption. Finally, complete further improvement that the location is distinguishable in ASR and the query contents are diverse in Aset. Simulations show that the LCA performs well on cloaking success rate, query precision, and resources saving.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2607766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07593330.pdf","startPage":"6515","endPage":"6527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2607766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Location Cloaking Algorithm Based on Combinatorial Optimization for Location-Based Services in 5G Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593330","topic":"5G Wireless Technologies: Perspectives of the Next Generation Mobile Communications and Networking","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"A Location Cloaking Algorithm Based on Combinatorial Optimization for Location-Based Services in 5G Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593330/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16433295","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593330/","volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272529 and 61672148"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272529"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"N130817003"},{"fundingName":"Hundred Thousand and Ten Thousand Talent Project of Liaoning Province","grantNumber":"201514"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Location Cloaking Algorithm Based on Combinatorial Optimization for Location-Based Services in 5G Networks","sourcePdf":"access-bai-2607766-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134789S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["5G Wireless Technologies: Perspectives of the Next Generation Mobile Communications and Networking"],"articleId":"7593330","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593331,"authors":[{"name":"Guang-Hua Duan","affiliation":["III-V Lab, Palaiseau, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/7456399/7593331/duan-2614661-small.gif","p":["Guang-Hua Duan (S\u201988\u2013M\u201990\u2013SM\u201901)\n received the B.E. degree from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 1983, and the M.E. and Doctorate degrees from\n the Ecole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des T\u00e9l\u00e9communications (Telecom-ParisTech), Paris, France, in 1987\n and 1991, respectively, all in applied physics.

The device is proposed to further reduce the read noise of QIS jots and ultimately realize a read noise of 0.15e-r.m.s. for accurate photoelectron counting. We take advantage of the small gate capacitance in a p-channel JFET SF to reduce the total capacitance of the floating diffusion, which yields a greatly improved conversion gain of 1.38 mV/e- in TCAD simulation compared to MOSFET SF with the same pitch size. Lower 1/f noise is also anticipated yielding a low input-referred read noise. The device is designed in a 45 nm CMOS image sensor process. The fundamental working principles of this device are discussed, and important functionalities are analyzed with simulation and theory.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytical Modeling and TCAD Simulation of a Quanta Image Sensor Jot Device With a JFET Source-Follower for Deep Sub-Electron Read Noise","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society","doi":"10.1109/JEDS.2016.2618721","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of the Electron Devices Society","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245494/7792235/07593336.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JEDS.2016.2618721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7792235","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593336","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593336/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Analytical Modeling and TCAD Simulation of a Quanta Image Sensor Jot Device With a JFET Source-Follower for Deep Sub-Electron Read Noise","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7593336/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16561768","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Rambus"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Analytical Modeling and TCAD Simulation of a Quanta Image Sensor Jot Device With a JFET Source-Follower for Deep Sub-Electron Read Noise","sourcePdf":"jeds-ma-2618721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088682S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6245494","isNumber":"7792235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245494","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7792235","articleId":"7593336","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7593338,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Lian","affiliation":["School of Control Science and Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7812803/7593338/lian-2618872-small.gif","p":["Jie Lian (M\u201910) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in control\n theory and control engineering from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering,\n Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China.

Recently, efforts have been made to integrate molecular communication with Lab-on-chip (LOC); one of the techniques used in LOC for manipulation and transportation of molecules is Dielctrophoresis (DEP). We propose the use of DEP in molecular communication to maintain in-sequence delivery of molecules. DEP planar electrodes are modeled as relays used in telecommunications. We describe the theoretical system model and analyze the effect of introducing DEP relays in diffusive channel in terms of probability of in-sequence delivery of molecules. Information rate of DEP-based channel is analytically obtained for in-sequence delivery. The numerical results obtained show that the information rate for in-sequence delivery of molecules through diffusive channel increases by 26% if DEP relays are used in the channel. Though the system is sensitive to noise variance, incorporation of DEP relay results in a substantial improvement in the capacity of the channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593340/","volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7593340/","accessionNumber":"16561780","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"27775531","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dielectrophoretic Relay Assisted Molecular Communication for In-Sequence Molecule Delivery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dielectrophoretic Relay Assisted Molecular Communication for In-Sequence Molecule Delivery","sourcePdf":"tnb-manocha-2618904-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106094S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7792105","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7792105","articleId":"7593340","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7593341,"authors":[{"name":"Nuno Souto","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, ISCTE-University Institute of Lisbon, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Nuno","lastName":"Souto","id":"37270173100"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["Faculdade de Ci\u00eancias e Tecnologia da Universidade Nova de Lisboa and Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Caparica, Portugal"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Dinis","id":"37269209500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"7593341","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":462},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency-domain analysis","MIMO","Complexity theory","Signal processing algorithms","Dispersion","Receivers","Time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","decoding","equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO detection","MIMO equalization","single-carrier systems","alternating direction method of multipliers","multiple-input multiple-output detection algorithm","ADMM","single-carrier transmissions","time dispersive channels","heuristic","maximum likelihood detection problem","arbitrary signal constellations","frequency domain","decoding steps","reduced complexity cost"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Alternating direction method of the multipliers (ADMM)","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection","nonconvex optimization","single carrier-frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE)"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a multiple-input multiple-output detection algorithm based on the alternating direction method of the multipliers (ADMM) is proposed for single-carrier transmissions in time dispersive channels.

The VSM scheme conveys information through both the indices of the virtual parallel channels and the M -ary modulated symbols. We derive a closed-form upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP), which considers the impact of imperfect channel estimation. Moreover, the asymptotic ABEP is also studied, which characterizes the error floor under imperfect channel estimation and the resulting diversity order as well as the coding gain under perfect channel estimation. Computer simulations verify the analysis and show that the VSM scheme can outperform the existing pre-coding aided spatial modulation schemes under the same spectral efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2618772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07593342.pdf","startPage":"6929","endPage":"6938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2618772","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Spatial Modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593342","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593342/","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Spatial Modulation","volume":"4","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16433056","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593342/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501190, 61201249, 61622101 and 61571020"},{"fundingName":"Nature Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2014A030310389"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Virtual Spatial Modulation","sourcePdf":"access-wen-2618772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10431S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7593342","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7593345,"authors":[{"name":"Khadijeh Masumnia-Bisheh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Trabiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/7827179/7593345/bishe-2614128-small.gif","p":["Khadijeh Masumnia-Bisheh (S'15) received the B.S.\n and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Babol Noshirvani University of Technology, Babol, Iran, in 2011 and\n 2015, respectively.

S-FDTD calculates both the mean and standard deviation of SAR caused by variability or uncertainty in the electrical properties of the human head tissues. The accuracy of the S-FDTD result is controlled by the approximations for correlation coefficients between the electrical properties of the tissues and the fields propagating in them. Hence, different approximations for correlation coefficients are tested in order to evaluate their effect on the standard deviation of SAR. The 1-D Monte Carlo correlation coefficient (MC-CC) approximation reported in our previous work is successfully extended to 2-D and also tested for the head model. Then, all the results are compared with that of full-fledged Monte Carlo method (considered as gold standard in statistical simulations). In order to accelerate the simulations, the proposed algorithm is run on graphics processing unit by exploiting OpenACC application program interface. Using different correlation coefficients shows that the extended 2-D MC-CC S-FDTD results are very close to that of Monte Carlo and yield more accurate results than other approximations in SAR calculations.","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2016.2614128","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel7/15/7827179/07593345.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2016.2614128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7827179","startPage":"509","endPage":"517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Different Approximations for Correlation Coefficients in Stochastic FDTD to Estimate SAR Variance in a Human Head Model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593345","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Different Approximations for Correlation Coefficients in Stochastic FDTD to Estimate SAR Variance in a Human Head Model","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593345/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16618143","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7593345/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Different Approximations for Correlation Coefficients in Stochastic FDTD to Estimate SAR Variance in a Human Head Model","sourcePdf":"temc-masumniabisheh-2614128-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098935S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"7827179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7827179","articleId":"7593345","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7593346,"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Hammler","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computing Sciences, Durham University, Durham, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503871/7728151/7593346/hamml-2609204-small.gif","p":["Jonathan Hammler (S\u201912\u2013GS\u201914) received the M.Eng.\n degree in general engineering (with a specialization in electronic engineering) from Durham University, Durham, U.K.,\n in 2014, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering.","His recent work has focused on single-pixel imaging schemes and their implementation at terahertz frequencies.

Free-space (noncontact), nondestructive testing has been performed on various planar dielectric and semiconducting samples. This system topology is well suited for quality control testing in an industrial setting requiring high throughput. Scattering parameters, measured in the absence of a sample, were used to computationally move the measurement plane to the surface of the samples being characterized. This de-embedding process can be completed much faster than a traditional calibration process and does not require exact knowledge of system geometric lengths. An iterative method was developed for simultaneously determining both sample geometric thickness and electric permittivity, through calculation of theoretical scattering parameters at material boundaries. A constrained nonlinear optimization process was employed to minimize the discrepancy between measured transmission and reflection data with this simulated data, in lieu of a closed-form parameter inversion algorithm. Monte Carlo simulations of parameter retrieval in the presence of artificial noise have demonstrated our method's robustness and superior noise rejection compared with a noniterative method. The precision of derived results has been improved by a factor of almost 50, compared to a closed-form extraction technique with identical input.","doi":"10.1109/TTHZ.2016.2609204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7728151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TTHZ.2016.2609204","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503871/7728151/07593346.pdf","startPage":"817","endPage":"823","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Free-Space Permittivity Measurement at Terahertz Frequencies With a Vector Network Analyzer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Free-Space Permittivity Measurement at Terahertz Frequencies With a Vector Network Analyzer","volume":"6","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593346/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16428095","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593346/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/M506321/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Free-Space Permittivity Measurement at Terahertz Frequencies With a Vector Network Analyzer","sourcePdf":"tthz-hammler-2609204-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078373S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5503871","isNumber":"7728151","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503871","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7728151","articleId":"7593346","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593352,"authors":[{"name":"Haifeng Yuan","affiliation":["Centre of Advanced Microelectronic Devices, NUS Suzhou Research Institute, Suzhou, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7809190/7593352/yuan-2618877-small.gif","p":["Haifeng Yuan was born in Shenyang, China, in 1983.

By introducing the smoothness function to measure the extent of channel fluctuation, we derive a robust soft-decision-aided (SDA) channel estimator based on Pareto optimality of the double-objective optimization of the likelihood function of the received signal sequence and the smoothness constraint of the channel estimates. Compared with the conventional maximum-likelihood-based channel estimators derived under the block-fading assumption, the newly derived SDA-Pareto estimator gives more freedom to the channel estimation process, allowing channel estimates to have controlled variations to track the time-varying channel more closely. Compared with estimators derived based on the maximum a posteriori probability or the minimum mean-square error criterion which require explicit acquisition of the CMI, the SDA-Pareto estimator significantly simplifies the channel measurement process by requiring only a suitable regularization parameter to balance the trade-off between the likelihood function and the smoothness condition. An adaptive algorithm is proposed to adjust the regularization parameter adaptively, enabling an efficient and effective implementation of the SDA-Pareto estimator in practical applications. Simulation studies are provided to demonstrate the advantage of the SDA-Pareto estimator over the conventional estimators in both channel estimation accuracy and error-rate performance.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7809190/07593352.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"86","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2618877","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2618877","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809190","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft-Decision-Aided, Smoothness-Constrained Channel Estimation over Time-Varying Fading Channels With No Channel Model Information","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593352/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Soft-Decision-Aided, Smoothness-Constrained Channel Estimation over Time-Varying Fading Channels With No Channel Model Information","htmlLink":"/document/7593352/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16618425","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NUS AcRF TIER 1","grantNumber":"WBS R-263-000-A51-112"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61571316 and 61302112"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft-Decision-Aided, Smoothness-Constrained Channel Estimation over Time-Varying Fading Channels With No Channel Model Information","sourcePdf":"twc-yuan-2618877-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09658S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7809190","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7809190","articleId":"7593352","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7593353,"authors":[{"name":"Le Van Hien","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Deakin University, Geelong, VIC, Australia","Department of Mathematics, Hanoi National University of Education, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Le","lastName":"Van Hien","orcid":"0000-0003-1787-3011","id":"37086314132"},{"name":"Doan Thai Son","affiliation":["Tran Phu High School for Gifted Students, Haiphong, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Doan Thai","lastName":"Son","id":"37086312166"},{"name":"Hieu Trinh","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Deakin University, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Hieu","lastName":"Trinh","orcid":"0000-0003-3438-9969","id":"37299173900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"7593353","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":597},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Neural networks","Stability analysis","Learning systems","Trajectory","Mathematical model","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","delays","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global dissipativity analysis","nonautonomous neural networks","multiple proportional delays","differential inequalities","explicit delay-independent conditions","generalized exponential attracting sets","generalized exponential estimate","Halanay-type inequalities","constructive approach","M-matrix theory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attracting sets","dissipativity","M-matrix","proportional delays"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593353","abstract":"This brief addresses the problem of global dissipativity analysis of nonautonomous neural networks with multiple proportional delays.

Finally, three numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and improvement of the obtained results.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2614998","startPage":"225","endPage":"231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2614998","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8244326","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8244326/07593353.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Global Dissipativity of Nonautonomous Neural Networks With Multiple Proportional Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593353/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"On Global Dissipativity of Nonautonomous Neural Networks With Multiple Proportional Delays","volume":"29","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7593353/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17468826","pubMedId":"27775543","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Global Dissipativity of Nonautonomous Neural Networks With Multiple Proportional Delays","sourcePdf":"tnnls-le-2614998-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107085S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8244326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8244326","articleId":"7593353","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7593364,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadreza Fakhari Moghaddam Arani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7951114/7593364/arani-2618391-small.gif","p":["Mohammadreza Fakhari Moghaddam Arani (S\u201912) was born in Kashan,\n Iran, in 1987.

Droop and virtual inertia are the most reported methods in the literature. However, their impact on the generator and system frequency stability, when the double-mass mechanical dynamics of a wind power generator are considered, has not been addressed thoroughly. In this paper, small-signal modeling, analysis, and eigenvalues studies are used to show that incorporating a wind power generator in the frequency regulation can expose its shaft to forces stimulating its natural resonance frequency dynamics and lead to instability. This paper shows that the mechanical resonance of frequency-regulating wind generators must be studied and enhanced not individually but as a part of the whole power system stability analyses. To overcome the stability problem caused by implementing frequency regulation in wind generators, this paper investigates different alternatives to stabilize the generator dynamics and, at the same time, minimize undesirable interference in the conventional wind power generator controllers. Time-domain simulation results validate the analytical results and discussions.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7951114","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2618391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7951114/07593364.pdf","startPage":"3195","endPage":"3204","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2618391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Damping of Mechanical Resonance of Wind Power Generators Contributing to Frequency Regulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Damping of Mechanical Resonance of Wind Power Generators Contributing to Frequency Regulation","volume":"32","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7593364/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969954","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593364/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Damping of Mechanical Resonance of Wind Power Generators Contributing to Frequency Regulation","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-arani-2618391-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087443S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7951114","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7951114","articleId":"7593364","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7593373,"authors":[{"name":"Dongrae Cho","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Science and Engineering, Institute of Integrated Technology, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/8003524/7593373/cho-2618937-small.gif","p":["Dongrae Cho received the B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from the Inje University, Gimhae, Korea and M.S. degree in School of Mechatronics, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST), Gwangju, Korea.

We prepared simulation data and 65 clinical cases of seizure. In addition, various filtering algorithms including bandpass filtering, empirical mode decomposition, multivariate empirical mode decomposition and noise-assisted multivariate empirical mode decomposition (NA-MEMD) were used to decompose spectral components from the data. Moreover, in the case of clinical data, the PLVs were used to classify between interictal and preictal stages using a support vector machine. The highest PLV was achieved with NA-MEMD with 0-dB white noise algorithm (0.9988), which exhibited statistically significant differences compared to other filtering algorithms. Moreover, the classification rate was the highest for the NA-MEMD with 0-dB algorithm (83.17%). In terms of frequency components, examining the gamma band resulted in the highest classification rates for all algorithms, compared to other frequency bands such as theta, alpha, and beta bands. We found that PLVs calculated with the NA-MEMD algorithm could be used as a potential biological marker for seizure prediction. Moreover, the gamma frequency band was useful for discriminating between interictal and preictal stages.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG-Based Prediction of Epileptic Seizures Using Phase Synchronization Elicited from Noise-Assisted Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2618937","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Systems and Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7333/8003524/07593373.pdf","startPage":"1309","endPage":"1318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2016.2618937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8003524","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","displayDocTitle":"EEG-Based Prediction of Epileptic Seizures Using Phase Synchronization Elicited from Noise-Assisted Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7593373/","dateOfInsertion":"09 August 2017","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17136103","pubMedId":"27775526","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"GIST Research Institute (GRI) in 2016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Pioneer Research Center Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"2012-0009462"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"EEG-Based Prediction of Epileptic Seizures Using Phase Synchronization Elicited from Noise-Assisted Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition","sourcePdf":"tnsre-lee-2618937-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.16043S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"8003524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"8003524","articleId":"7593373","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7593380,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Yin","affiliation":["Research Institute of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/7948816/7593380/yin-2618901-small.gif","p":["Shen Yin (M'12\u2013SM'15) received the B.E. degree in automation\n from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2004, the M.Sc. degree in control and information system, and\n the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and information technology from the University of Duisburg-Essen, Duisburg,\n Germany.","He is currently a Professor with the Research Center of Intelligent Control and Systems, Harbin Institute of\n Technology.

Generalized neural networks consist of a finite number of modes, which may jump from one mode to another according to a Markovian chain with known transition probability. By constructing novel augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) with triple integral terms that contain more and more information on the state vectors of the NNs, the upper bound of the successive time-varying delays is formulated. By employing a new integral inequality technique, free-weighting matrix-based integral inequality approach, and Wirtinger double integral inequality technique and that is combined with the reciprocally convex combination approach to estimate the single and double integral terms in the time derivative of the LKFs, a new set of delay-dependent conditions for the asymptotic stability of the considered NNs are represented in the form of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, five numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach with a four-tank benchmark real-world problem.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2016.2609147","startPage":"485","endPage":"499","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2609147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8318008","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/8318008/07593382.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Criteria for Stability of Generalized Neural Networks Including Markov Jump Parameters and Additive Time Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593382/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New Criteria for Stability of Generalized Neural Networks Including Markov Jump Parameters and Additive Time Delays","volume":"48","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7593382/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17617451","publicationDate":"April 2018","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology, Science and Engineering Research Board, Government of India, New Delhi","grantNumber":"SR/FTP/MS-041/2011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A1A1006101"},{"fundingName":"Brain Korea 21 Plus Project in 2016"},{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung","grantNumber":"1121070 STP"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Criteria for Stability of Generalized Neural Networks Including Markov Jump Parameters and Additive Time Delays","sourcePdf":"tsmc-ahn-2609147-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155607S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"8318008","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"8318008","articleId":"7593382","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":7593385,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Sun","affiliation":["School of Reliability and Systems Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China","Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hung Hom, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7886374/7593385/sun-2618422-small.gif","p":["Bo Sun (M\u201907) received the B.S. degree in mechanical\n engineering from Beijing Institute of Mechanical Industry, Beijing, China, in 2001, and the Ph.D. degree in\n reliability engineering and systems engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, in 2007.","He is currently an Assistant Professor and a member of the Faculty of Systems Engineering, School of Reliability and\n Systems Engineering, Beihang University.

In particular, the need for high reliability and long lifetime poses new challenges for the research and development, production, and application of LED lighting. Accurate and effective prediction of the lifetime or reliability of LED lighting has emerged as one of the key issues in the solid-state lighting field. Prognostic is an engineering technology that predicts the future reliability or determines the remaining useful lifetime of a product by assessing the extent of deviation or degradation of a product from its expected normal operating conditions. Prognostics bring benefits to both LED developers and users, such as optimizing system design, shortening qualification test times, enabling condition-based maintenance for LED-based systems, and providing information for return-on-investment analysis. This paper provides an overview of the prognostic methods and models that have been applied to both LED devices and LED systems, especially for use in long-term operational conditions. These methods include statistical regression, static Bayesian network, Kalman filtering, particle filtering, artificial neural network, and physics-based methods. The general concepts and main features of these methods, the advantages and disadvantages of applying these methods, as well as LED application case studies, are discussed. The fundamental issues of prognostics and photoelectrothermal theory for LED systems are also discussed for clear understanding of the reliability and lifetime concepts for LEDs. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in developing effective prognostic techniques are addressed.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2618422","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7886374/07593385.pdf","startPage":"6338","endPage":"6362","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2618422","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7886374","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review of Prognostic Techniques for High-Power White LEDs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593385/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Review of Prognostic Techniques for High-Power White LEDs","volume":"32","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16773913","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7593385/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673037"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2015AA033304"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150249"},{"fundingName":"Changzhou Sci & Tech Program","grantNumber":"CJ20159053"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006579","fundingName":"Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of PRC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004377","fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"G-YBDY"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review of Prognostic Techniques for High-Power White LEDs","sourcePdf":"tpel-fan-2618422-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.296982S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7886374","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7886374","articleId":"7593385","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-26"},{"_id":7593387,"authors":[{"name":"Chenguang Yang","affiliation":["Zienkiewicz Centre for Computational Engineering, Swansea University, Swansea, U.K.","Key Laboratory of Autonomous Systems and Networked Control, College of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7982810/7593387/yang-2615061-small.gif","p":["Chenguang Yang (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.Eng. degree in measurement and control from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in control engineering from the National University of Singapore, Singapore, in 2010.","He received Post-Doctoral training from Imperial College London, London, U.K. He is a Senior Lecturer with the Zienkiewicz Centre for Computational Engineering, Swansea University, Swansea, U.K. He is also with the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China.

The teleoperation system is set up with a TouchX joystick as the master device and a simulated Baxter robot arm as the slave robot. The haptic feedback is provided to the human operator to sense the interaction force between the slave robot and the environment when manipulating the stylus of the joystick. To utilize the workspace of the telerobot as much as possible, a matching process is carried out between the master and the slave based on their kinematics models. The closed loop inverse kinematics (CLIK) method and RBF NN approximation technique are seamlessly integrated in the control design. To overcome the potential instability problem in the presence of delayed communication channels, wave variables and their corrections are effectively embedded into the control system, and Lyapunov-based analysis is performed to theoretically establish the closed-loop stability. Comparative experiments have been conducted for a trajectory tracking task, under the different conditions of various communication delays. Experimental results show that in terms of tracking performance and force reflection, the proposed control approach shows superior performance over the conventional methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2016.2615061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7982810","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2615061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7982810/07593387.pdf","startPage":"2125","endPage":"2136","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Teleoperation Control Based on Combination of Wave Variable and Neural Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"18 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Teleoperation Control Based on Combination of Wave Variable and Neural Networks","volume":"47","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593387/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17031071","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593387/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61473120, 61573147 and 91520201"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030313266"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Collaboration","grantNumber":"2015A050502017"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangzhou","grantNumber":"201607010006"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015ZM065"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Teleoperation Control Based on Combination of Wave Variable and Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tsmc-yang-2615061-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.221763S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7982810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7982810","articleId":"7593387","onlineDate":"18 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7593399,"authors":[{"name":"Neethu Robinson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India"],"bio":{"p":["Neethu Robinson (neethur@goa.bits-pilani.ac.in) earned her B.Tech.

The objective is to observe consumers\u2019 energy usage pattern and exploit this information to assist the grid in designing incentives, energy management mechanisms, and real-time demand response protocols, so as help the grid achieve lower costs and improve energy supply stability. Further, by feeding the observed information back to the consumers instantaneously, it is also possible to promote energy efficient behavior among users. To this end, this paper performs a literature survey on smart grid testbeds around the world, and presents the main accomplishments toward realizing a smart grid testbed at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The testbed is able to monitor, analyze, and evaluate smart grid communication network design and control mechanisms, and test the suitability of various communications networks for both residential and commercial buildings. The testbeds are deployed within the SUTD student dormitories and the main university campus to monitor and record end-user energy consumption in real-time, which will enable us to design incentives, control algorithms, and real-time demand response schemes. The testbed also provides an effective channel to evaluate the needs of communication networks to support various smart grid applications. In addition, our initial results demonstrate that our testbed can provide an effective platform to identify energy waste, and prompt the needs of a secure communications channel as the energy usage pattern can provide privacy related information on individual users.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7811822","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2016.1400377RP","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7811822/07593427.pdf","startPage":"70","endPage":"80","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2016.1400377RP","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Grid Testbed for Demand Focused Energy Management in End User Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"December  2016","displayDocTitle":"Smart Grid Testbed for Demand Focused Energy Management in End User Environments","volume":"23","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7593427/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"December 2016","accessionNumber":"16597969","dateOfInsertion":"10 January 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593427/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart Grid Testbed for Demand Focused Energy Management in End User Environments","sourcePdf":"014TUSHAR_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075435S","chronDate":"December  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7811822","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7811822","articleId":"7593427","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7593429,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Taleb","affiliation":["Sejong Univesity, Aalto University"],"bio":{"p":["Tarik Taleb [s'04, M'05, Sm' (tarik.taleb@aaltc.fi) received the B.E. degree (with distinction) in information engineering and the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in information science from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2001, 2003, and 2005, respectively.

However, it is generally agreed that cloud computing, network function virtualization (NFV), and software defined networking (SDN) will be key enabling technologies for 5G. Indeed, putting all these technologies together ensures several advantages in terms of network configuration flexibility, scalability, and elasticity, which are highly needed to fulfill the numerous requirements of 5G. Furthermore, 5G network management procedures should be as simple as possible, allowing network operators to orchestrate and manage the lifecycle of their virtual network infrastructures (VNIs) and the corresponding virtual network functions (VNFs), in a cognitive and programmable fashion. To this end, we introduce the concept of \u201cAnything as a Service\u201d (ANYaaS), which allows a network operator to create and orchestrate 5G services on demand and in a dynamic way. ANYaaS relies on the reference ETSI NFV architecture to orchestrate and manage important services such as mobile Content Delivery Network as a Service (CDNaaS), Traffic Offload as a Service (TOFaaS), and Machine Type Communications as a Service (MTCaaS). Ultimately, ANYaaS aims for enabling dynamic creation and management of mobile services through agile approaches that handle 5G network resources and services.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2016.1500244RP","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764265","startPage":"84","endPage":"91","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel7/65/7764265/07593429.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\"Anything as a Service\" for 5G Mobile Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"November-December  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593429/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"\"Anything as a Service\" for 5G Mobile Systems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"November-December 2016","accessionNumber":"16518742","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"30","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\"Anything as a Service\" for 5G Mobile Systems","sourcePdf":"016TALEB_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03991S","chronDate":"November-December  2016","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"7764265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7764265","articleId":"7593429","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7593430,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed M.

These prominent features include but are not limited to abundant license-free spectrum, the ability to provide multiple gigabit-per-second data rates, low energy consumption, and low implementation costs. In this article a heterogeneous multi-layer 5G cellular architecture with a control plane and user plane separation scheme is presented. Three layers - the macrocell layer operating below 3 GHz, the picocell layer operating in the mmWave spectrum, and the optical attocell layer operating at the visible spectrum - are considered in this architecture, with each layer targeting a different coverage and communication need. We further address potential solutions for uplink communications, backhaul connections, and downlink communications in an optical attocell. Several key technologies employed in VLC downlink communications, including modulation, multiple access, and error control schemes, are also discussed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593453/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"November-December  2016","volume":"30","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16518740","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"November-December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593453/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Applying VLC in 5G Networks: Architectures and Key Technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying VLC in 5G Networks: Architectures and Key Technologies","sourcePdf":"015HU1_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065041S","chronDate":"November-December  2016","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"7764265","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7764265","articleId":"7593453","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7593454,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zhang","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Jing Zhang (M'13) (zhangjing@hust.edu.cn) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electronics and information engineering from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2002 and 2010, respectively.

Although mmw communication systems have been successfully applied to indoor scenarios, various external factors in an outdoor environment limit the applications of mobile communication systems working at the mmw bands. In this article, we discuss the issues involved in the design of antenna array architecture for future 5G mmw systems, in which the antenna elements can be deployed in the shapes of a cross, circle, or hexagon, in addition to the conventional rectangle. The simulation results indicate that while there always exists a non-trivial gain fluctuation in other regular antenna arrays, the circular antenna array has a flat gain in the main lobe of the radiation pattern with varying angles. This makes the circular antenna array more robust to angle variations that frequently occur due to antenna vibration in an outdoor environment. In addition, in order to guarantee effective coverage of mmw communication systems, possible solutions such as distributed antenna systems and cooperative multi-hop relaying are discussed, together with the design of mmw antenna arrays. Furthermore, other challenges for the implementation of mmw cellular networks, for example, blockage, communication security, hardware development, and so on, are discussed, as are potential solutions.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2016.1400374RP","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2016.1400374RP","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7909083/07593454.pdf","startPage":"106","endPage":"112","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5G Millimeter-Wave Antenna Array: Design and Challenges","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"5G Millimeter-Wave Antenna Array: Design and Challenges","volume":"24","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593454/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16838342","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593454/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5G Millimeter-Wave Antenna Array: Design and Challenges","sourcePdf":"023GUIZANI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066334S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7909083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"7909083","articleId":"7593454","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":7593456,"authors":[{"name":"Adnan Aijaz","affiliation":["Telecommunications Research Laboratories, Toshiba Research Europe Ltd., Bristol, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Adnan Aijaz [M'14] (adnan.aijaz@toshiba-trel.com) received the M.Sc. degree in mobile and personal communications, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering from Kings College London, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.

The current popular cloud computing models encompass a cluster of expensive and dedicated machines to provide cloud computing services, incurring significant investment in capital outlay and ongoing costs. A more cost effective solution would be to exploit the capabilities of an ad hoc cloud which consists of a cloud of distributed and dynamically untapped local resources. The ad hoc cloud can be further classified into static and mobile clouds: an ad hoc static cloud harnesses the underutilized computing resources of general purpose machines, whereas an ad hoc mobile cloud harnesses the idle computing resources of mobile devices. However, the dynamic and distributed characteristics of ad hoc cloud introduce challenges in system management. In this article, we propose a generic em autonomic mobile cloud (AMCloud) management framework for automatic and efficient service/resource management of ad hoc cloud in both static and mobile modes. We then discuss in detail the possible security and privacy issues in ad hoc cloud computing. A general security architecture is developed to facilitate the study of prevention and defense approaches toward a secure autonomic cloud system. This article is expected to be useful for exploring future research activities to achieve an autonomic and secure ad hoc cloud computing system.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7909083/07593457.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"AMCloud: Toward a Secure Autonomic Mobile Ad Hoc Cloud Computing System","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2016.1500119RP","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7909083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2016.1500119RP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593457/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 October 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"AMCloud: Toward a Secure Autonomic Mobile Ad Hoc Cloud Computing System","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16838333","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7593457/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"AMCloud: Toward a Secure Autonomic Mobile Ad Hoc Cloud Computing System","sourcePdf":"019CHENG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039861S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7909083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7909083","articleId":"7593457","onlineDate":"20 October 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7593464,"authors":[{"name":"Gerard Rankin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, Australia"],"firstName":"Gerard","lastName":"Rankin","id":"37394719500"},{"name":"Andrew Tirkel","affiliation":["Scientific Technology Pty Ltd, Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Tirkel","id":"37270187000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0429-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0430-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7593464","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":143},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Australia","Doppler radar","MIMO","Doppler effect","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler radar","millimetre wave radar","MIMO radar","radar imaging","radar transmitters","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar imaging","millimeter-wave radar","collision avoidance","mechanically scanned radars","resolution imaging","electronically scanned array","transceivers","image quality","transmitter","signal processing scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radar","MIMO","spreading sequence","Doppler","UAV"]}],"abstract":"Millimeter-wave radar for collision avoidance, takeoff and landing in challenging environments requires high resolution imaging.

source. The Prognostics & Health Management of fuel cell is an emerging field, which is paving the way for large scale industrial deployment of PEMFC technology. More precisely, prognostics of PEMFC become a major area of focus nowadays that enables predicting the behavior of PEMFC to produce actionable information to extend its life span. This paper contributes the first application on data-driven prognostics of PEMFC stack under variable load for combined heat and power generation (\u03bcCHP). In brief, an ensemble structure of Summation Wavelet-Extreme Learning Machine models is proposed with a new incremental learning scheme, to achieve long-term predictions on stack state of health (SOH) and to give confidence for better decisions. The proposed prognostics model is validated on data from PEMFC stack used for a \u03bcCHP application under variable load profile for a complete year. A thorough comparison on SOH predictions results clearly shows the significance of proposed prognostics model, which can predict with few learning data for a long-term prognostics horizon around 650 hours with high accuracy and low uncertainty.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593569/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"16397588","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"PEM fuel cell prognostics under variable load: A data-driven ensemble with new incremental learning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PEM fuel cell prognostics under variable load: A data-driven ensemble with new incremental learning","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"Paper050.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105855S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587666","isNumber":"7593519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587666","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7593519","articleId":"7593569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7593570,"authors":[{"name":"Houssam Nahilia","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical and Industrial Systems, University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Houssam","lastName":"Nahilia","id":"37085704728"},{"name":"Mohamed Boudour","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electrical and Industrial Systems, University of Science and Technology Houari Boumediene Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Boudour","id":"37299921400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2188-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2187-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2189-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7593570","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593570","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power system stability","Genetic algorithms","Stability criteria","Particle swarm optimization","Generators","Minimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","genetic algorithms","IEEE standards","minimisation","particle swarm optimisation","power grids","power system stability","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","genetic algorithm","distribution power loss minimization","Algerian isolated grid","distributed generator placement","PSO","GA","DG placement","stochastic method application","electrical distribution network","distributed renewable generation source integration","standard IEEE test system","active loss minimization","voltage stability enhancement","voltage profile improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PSO","GA","Voltage index","Distributed Generation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CoDIT.2016.7593570","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587666/7593519/07593570.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","startPage":"258","endPage":"262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CoDIT.2016.7593570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution power loss minimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and genetic algorithms: Application on Algerian isolated grid","abstract":"The objective of this work is the application of stochastic methods of optimization as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) in order to locate the distributed generators (DG) placement and minimize the power loss in the electrical distribution network, taking into account the integration of distributed renewable generation sources. Thus, a comparative study with previous techniques proposed in literature is performed. The first step of the study is to apply the proposed methodology on standard IEEE test systems such as: IEEE 12-bus and IEEE 69-bus to validate the calculation program. In a second step, the proposed approach is tested on a real isolated distribution system from the Algerian network. Minimizing the active losses is subject to several constraints which are undertaken in this paper, depending on the penetration rate of the renewable source. Indeed, the aim of the study is not only minimizing active loss using PSO and GA, but also enhancing voltage stability by improving the voltage profile.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593570/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16397687","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593570/","publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Distribution power loss minimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and genetic algorithms: Application on Algerian isolated grid","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distribution power loss minimization using Particle Swarm Optimization and genetic algorithms: Application on Algerian isolated grid","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"Paper051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036064S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587666","isNumber":"7593519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587666","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7593519","articleId":"7593570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7593590,"authors":[{"name":"\u015eaban \u00d6zt\u00fcrk","affiliation":["Electrical-Electronics Engineering, Sel\u00e7uk University, Konya, Turkey"],"firstName":"\u015eaban","lastName":"\u00d6zt\u00fcrk","id":"37085887298"},{"name":"Bayram Akdem\u0131r","affiliation":["Electrical-Electronics Engineering, Sel\u00e7uk University, Konya, Turkey"],"firstName":"Bayram","lastName":"Akdem\u0131r","id":"37670291000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2188-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2187-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2189-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7593590","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":445},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593590","abstract":"In this study, an effective segmentation method is presented for defect detection on the glass surface. Defect detection on the glass surface is compelling and strenuous job for human eyes. Transparency and reflection properties of the glass surface reduce success of image processing algorithms using detection of the factors that unwanted and affecting quality of products such as crack, scratch, bubble. Traditional methods have limited success and long processing time in this process. Therefore, fast and effective method has been proposed. In the proposed method (BiasFeed CNN), bias input which is single number value traditional CNN algorithm is converted bias template. Bias template is used to balance the brightness level of the image. Input image and bias template convolution is applied bias input. Through the contribution from bias input, background reflections and negative effects arising from transparency are decreased. The developed method is fast as traditional CNN, because it does not cause significant changes in the structure of traditional CNN. 35 pieces of glass was tested using the algorithm. Damages in the glass surface and location of these damages were determined. Accuracy rates of inspected images are; sensivity %91, specificity %99, accuracy %98. BiasFeed CNN algorithm was tested on various images and it is more successful than traditional CNN algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CoDIT.2016.7593590","startPage":"366","endPage":"371","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587666/7593519/07593590.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CoDIT.2016.7593590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel BiasFeed cellular neural network model for glass defect inspection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Glass","Lighting","Mathematical model","Cameras","Prototypes","Optimization","Reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic optical inspection","cellular neural nets","convolution","glass products","image segmentation","object detection","product quality","production engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BiasFeed cellular neural network model","BiasFeed CNN","glass surface defect inspection","glass surface defect detection","segmentation method","glass surface transparency properties","glass surface reflection properties","image processing algorithms","glass product quality","crack","scratch","bubble","bias template convolution","background reflections"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cellular neural network","biasfeed","glass defect detection","texture inspection","cnn"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593590/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","displayDocTitle":"Novel BiasFeed cellular neural network model for glass defect inspection","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593590/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","accessionNumber":"16397692","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel BiasFeed cellular neural network model for glass defect inspection","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"Paper071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.129023S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587666","isNumber":"7593519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587666","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7593519","articleId":"7593590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593599,"authors":[{"name":"Ayman K.

Collaborative in-network processing among different sensor nodes is critical due to the limited capability of a single node. Task allocation is required to assign efficiently the workload of each task. In this paper, Logic Gate-based Evolutionary Algorithm (LGEA) is introduced which implements the logic gate mechanism in order to solve the task allocation problem. Each individual stands for a potential task allocation solution. The overall problem is formulated as a binary multiobjective optimization problem. The task workload and connectivity are the constraints that must be satisfied. The aim is to minimize the number of active nodes, the computation and the communication load distribution. Simulations confirm the potential of the logic gate mechanism to find the optimized task allocation scheme. The LGEA also outperforms the binary approach based on the Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO). Therefore, the Logic operation represents an original strategy and an efficient procedure for the binary optimization.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless sensor networks","Logic gates","Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","logic gates","particle swarm optimisation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor network","logic gate-based evolutionary algorithm","WSN","multiple computationally heavy in-network processing task execution","collaborative in-network processing","sensor nodes","LGEA","logic gate mechanism","task allocation problem","binary multiobjective optimization problem","task workload","task connectivity","computation load distribution","communication load distribution","binary particle swarm optimization","BPSO"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["logic gate","evolutionary algorithm","task allocation","binary optmization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593519","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CoDIT.2016.7593640","startPage":"654","endPage":"658","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies (CoDIT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7587666/7593519/07593640.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CoDIT.2016.7593640","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task allocation for wireless sensor network using logic gate-based evolutionary algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Task allocation for wireless sensor network using logic gate-based evolutionary algorithm","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16397576","publicationDate":"April 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 April 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593640/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593640/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 April 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task allocation for wireless sensor network using logic gate-based evolutionary algorithm","confLoc":"Saint Julian's, Malta","sourcePdf":"Paper121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06329S","chronDate":"6-8 April 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7587666","isNumber":"7593519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7587666","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7593519","articleId":"7593640","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593814,"authors":[{"name":"Krzysztof Duda","affiliation":["Department of Measurement and Electronics, AGH University of Science and Technology, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Krzysztof","lastName":"Duda","id":"37295607200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2667-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2666-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2668-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7593814","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Conferences","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","signal reconstruction","signal sampling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computationally efficient signal reconstruction","zero-crossing sampling","three points DFTs","discrete Fourier transform","uniformly sampled signals","inverse DFT","IDFT","polynomial representation","discrete signal","scaling factor","reversible transform","signal zero-crossings"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Fourier Transform","DFT","sampling","Implicit sampling","non-uniform sampling","zero-crossings"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593814","doi":"10.1109/ICSES.2016.7593814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSES.2016.7593814","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593801","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7586210/7593801/07593814.pdf","startPage":"29","endPage":"32","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally efficient signal reconstruction from zero-crossing sampling by the three points DFTs","abstract":"The DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) is defined for uniformly sampled signals.

In the paper basic theory of implicit sampling is reviewed and a new algorithm for efficient signal reconstruction from its zero-crossings, based on three points DFTs, is proposed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7593814/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397562","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient signal reconstruction from zero-crossing sampling by the three points DFTs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient signal reconstruction from zero-crossing sampling by the three points DFTs","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"01Topicpaper05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039492S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7586210","isNumber":"7593801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7586210","xplore-issue":"7593801","articleId":"7593814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593822,"authors":[{"name":"Marta Kolasa","affiliation":["UTP University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Telecommunications, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Kolasa","id":"37546752100"},{"name":"Tomasz Tala\u015bka","affiliation":["UTP University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Telecommunications, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Bydgoszcz, Poland"],"firstName":"Tomasz","lastName":"Tala\u015bka","id":"37294952800"},{"name":"Rafa\u0142 D\u0142ugosz","affiliation":["DELPHI Automotive Company, Krak\u00f3w, Poland"],"firstName":"Rafa\u0142","lastName":"D\u0142ugosz","id":"37085874458"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2667-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2666-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2668-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7593822","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":80},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Adders","Artificial neural networks","Logic gates","Power dissipation","Switches","CMOS technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","circuit simulation","CMOS integrated circuits","Gaussian processes","integrated circuit layout","learning (artificial intelligence)","self-organising feature maps"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["triangular neighborhood function","self-organizing neural network","CMOS technology","transistor level implementation","TNF","SOM","self-organizing map","application-specific integrated circuit","ASIC","Gaussian neighborhood function","GNF","learning property","single multiplication operation","asynchronous parallel binary tree","clock generator","post layout simulation","energy consumption","word length 4 bit","energy 2 pJ"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["neighborhood functions","SOM","parallel data processing","asynchronous circuits","CMOS implementation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593822","abstract":"The paper presents a novel transistor level implementation of a triangular neighborhood function (TNF) suitable for self-organizing maps (SOMs) realized as Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC). Our previous investigations have shown that using the TNF instead of more complex Gaussian neighborhood function (GNF) is sufficient to achieve good learning properties. It can be said that the TNF is a very good approximation of the GNF, while its hardware implementation requires only a single multiplication operation followed by shifting the bits to the right. The second operation is the substitute of a division operation by a number that is one of the powers of 2. In the proposed solution the multiplication is realized in an asynchronous parallel binary tree, without the use of any clock generator. As a result, this operation is very fast. The prototype circuit have been realized in the CMOS 130 nm technology and verified by means of the postlatout simulations. For the resolution of the input signals of 4 bits (sufficient even for relatively large maps), the overall calculation time equals about 5 ns. An average energy consumption for a single calculation cycle equals 2 pJ. The chip area equals about 0.01 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/ICSES.2016.7593822","startPage":"68","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSES.2016.7593822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593801","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7586210/7593801/07593822.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Triangular neighborhood function for self-organizing neural networks implemented in the CMOS 130nm technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593822/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Triangular neighborhood function for self-organizing neural networks implemented in the CMOS 130nm technology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593822/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16408308","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Triangular neighborhood function for self-organizing neural networks implemented in the CMOS 130nm technology","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"01Topicpaper13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057068S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7586210","isNumber":"7593801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7586210","xplore-issue":"7593801","articleId":"7593822","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7593836,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Several graphs show comparisons between characteristics of an ideal element and the model of real one with parasitics.","doi":"10.1109/ICSES.2016.7593845","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7586210/7593801/07593845.pdf","startPage":"173","endPage":"176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSES.2016.7593845","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling the generic TiO<inf>2</inf> memristor with the parasitic components","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593845/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Modelling the generic TiO<inf>2</inf> memristor with the parasitic components","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7593845/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408316","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling the generic TiO<inf>2</inf> memristor with the parasitic components","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"03Topicpaper10.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054857S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7586210","isNumber":"7593801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7586210","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7593801","articleId":"7593845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7593865,"authors":[{"name":"Jerzy D\u0105browski","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"D\u0105browski","id":"37273900000"},{"name":"Fahad Qazi","affiliation":["Catena Wireless Electronics AB, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fahad","lastName":"Qazi","id":"38194261200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2667-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2666-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2668-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7593865","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Communication systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","interference suppression","intermodulation distortion","multi-access systems","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency filters","radiofrequency interference","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum sensing","flexible RF filtering","cognitive radio","CR","congestion mitigation","multiple access communication system","spectrum sensor nonlinearity","SS nonlinearity","built-in flexible RF filter","intermodulation distortion","IMD","vacant channel detection","S/N ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","flexible RF filters","N-path filters","intermodulation distortions"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum sensing for cognitive radio based on flexible RF filtering","doi":"10.1109/ICSES.2016.7593865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7593801","endPage":"275","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Signals and Electronic Systems (ICSES)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7586210/7593801/07593865.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSES.2016.7593865","startPage":"270","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7593865","abstract":"In this paper we investigate a spectrum sensing technique suitable for cognitive radio (CR) considered a means to mitigate congestion in the future multiple access communication systems. The ultimate objective is opportunistic use of unoccupied frequency bands called spectrum holes or white spaces, which belong to another system. For this purpose, first, we identify the spectrum sensor (SS) nonlinearities and scan the available spectrum in wideband mode where the primary task is to identify strong interference. Next, by a complementary analysis we pick up channels which are likely to be spectrum holes. In the second stage the SS is tuned to a selected sub-band by making use of a built-in flexible RF filter which largely attenuates interference and the related intermodulation distortions (IMD). The scan process carried out in this stage is aimed at detection of a vacant channel, i.e. containing only noise that must be distinguished from a possible weak signal that usually requires a significant computation overhead, but as the scan is narrowband and the S/N ratio can be high, the related overhead is largely reduced compared to the wideband sensing approach. The strength of this technique is in the flexible RF filter eliminating IMD which typically tend to obscure the spectrum holes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7593865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16397548","htmlLink":"/document/7593865/","conferenceDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum sensing for cognitive radio based on flexible RF filtering","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum sensing for cognitive radio based on flexible RF filtering","confLoc":"Krakow, Poland","sourcePdf":"06Topicpaper03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04331S","chronDate":"5-7 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7586210","isNumber":"7593801","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7586210","xplore-issue":"7593801","articleId":"7593865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7594025,"authors":[{"name":"Tauqeer Safdar","affiliation":["Department of Computer & Information Sciences Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Perak Darul Ridzuan, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Tauqeer","lastName":"Safdar","id":"37085900748"},{"name":"Halabi B.

The addition of reinforcement learning (RL) based network management agents can improve Quality of Service (QoS) by reconfiguring the network layer protocol parameters in response to observed network performance conditions. This paper presents a closed-loop approach to tuning the parameters of the protocol of network layer based on current and previous network state observation for user and channel interference, specifically by modifying some parameters of Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol for Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Network (CRAHN) environment. In this work, we provide a self-contained learning method based on machine-learning techniques that have been or can be used for developing cognitive routing protocols. Generally, the developed mathematical model based on the one RL technique to handle the route decision in channel switching and user mobility situation so that the overall end-to-end delay can be minimized and the overall throughput of the network can be maximized according to the application requirement in CRAHN environment. Here is the proposed self-configuration method based on RL technique can improve the performance of the original AODV protocol, reducing protocol overhead and end-to-end delay for CRAHN while increasing the packet delivery ratio depending upon the traffic model. Simulation results are shown using NS-2 which shows the proposed model performance is much better than the previous AODV protocol.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7594025/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16397492","htmlLink":"/document/7594025/","conferenceDate":"19-20 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Effect of reinforcement learning on routing of cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of reinforcement learning on routing of cognitive radio ad-hoc networks","confLoc":"Ipoh, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"CR12.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057728S","chronDate":"19-20 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7585846","isNumber":"7594011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585846","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7594011","articleId":"7594025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7594039,"authors":[{"name":"Tahir Mehmood","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Tahir","lastName":"Mehmood","id":"37297334600"},{"name":"Helmi B Md Rais","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, University Teknologi PETRONAS, Tronoh, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Helmi B Md","lastName":"Rais","id":"37400308300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7896-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7897-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7594039","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":369},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Support vector machines","Intrusion detection","Classification algorithms","Feature extraction","Data models","Ant colony optimization","Machine learning algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimisation","data integrity","digital signatures","feature selection","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","security of data","set theory","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network anomaly detection","ACO feature subset","network security","data integrity","data availability","intrusion detection systems","confidentiality violation","detection techniques","signature-based technique","anomaly-based technique","classification approach","anomaly detection model development","data classification","normal class","attack class","ant system","ant colony optimization","redundant feature filtering","irrelevant feature filtering","support vector machine classification algorithm","SVM","KDD99","reduced feature set training","true positive rate","false positive rate","precision measure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["intrusion detection system","machine learning","network-based intrusion detection system","anomaly detection","ant colony optimization","support vector machine"]}],"abstract":"Over the past short time, network security facing a lot of challenges. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are the major concerns of the data. To cope with this problem different systems have been developed and the systems are known as Intrusion detection systems. Intrusion detection system detects the violation of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data. Intrusion detection systems are developed on the bases of two different detection techniques, signature-based technique and anomaly-based technique. Classification approach has been widely adopted for the development of the anomaly detection model to classify the data into normal class and attack class. But irrelevant and redundant features are the obstacle for classification algorithm to build an efficient detection model. This paper proposes a detection model, ant system with support vector machine, which uses ant system, a variation of ant colony optimization, to filter out the redundant and irrelevant features for support vector machine classification algorithm. KDD99, which is a benchmark dataset used for anomaly detection, has been adopted here. Each instance in KDD99 has been represented by 41 features which also has some redundant or irrelevant features. Ant system has been used to remove those redundant and irrelevant features. The selected feature subset using ant system is then validated using support vector machine. The experimental results showed that the performance of the classification algorithm, when trained with the reduced feature set, has been improved. The performance measures used in this comparison are true positive rate, false positive rate, and precision.","doi":"10.1109/ISMSC.2015.7594039","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Mathematical Sciences and Computing Research (iSMSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Mathematical Sciences and Computing Research (iSMSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585846/7594011/07594039.pdf","startPage":"121","endPage":"126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMSC.2015.7594039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7594011","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SVM for network anomaly detection using ACO feature subset","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7594039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7594039/","displayDocTitle":"SVM for network anomaly detection using ACO feature subset","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"16397519","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7594039/","conferenceDate":"19-20 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SVM for network anomaly detection using ACO feature subset","confLoc":"Ipoh, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"CR42.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063381S","chronDate":"19-20 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7585846","isNumber":"7594011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585846","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7594011","articleId":"7594039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7594056,"authors":[{"name":"Gamal Abdulnaser Alkawsi","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Seri Iskandar, Perak, MY"],"firstName":"Gamal Abdulnaser","lastName":"Alkawsi","id":"37085892459"},{"name":"Ahmad Kamil Mahmood","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Ahmad Kamil","lastName":"Mahmood","id":"37408373600"},{"name":"Yahia Mohamed Baashar","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Universiti Teknologi PETRONAS, Perak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Yahia Mohamed","lastName":"Baashar","id":"37085895106"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7896-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-7897-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7594056","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":680},"abstract":"The main purpose of this paper is to review the literatures on the adoption of Cloud Computing by SMEs in order to learn the current state of Cloud Computing studies and identify gaps for future research.

Findings revealed that there are growing numbers of studies in the adoption of Cloud Computing from different perspectives, yet there is a lack of theoretical and empirical studies in the field. Findings also indicated that there are only few articles evaluated the organizational perspective of Cloud Computing adoption in SMEs, while the majority of studies discussed operational and technical issues. Furthermore, this review observed various factors influencing the adoption of Cloud computing, which were addressed based on the four main criteria of the acceptance and diffusion of technological innovations, which are individual, organization, technology and environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Mathematical Sciences and Computing Research (iSMSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585846/7594011/07594056.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"225","publicationTitle":"2015 International Symposium on Mathematical Sciences and Computing Research (iSMSC)","doi":"10.1109/ISMSC.2015.7594056","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISMSC.2015.7594056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7594011","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7594056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Factors influencing the adoption of cloud computing in SME: A systematic review","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Biological system modeling","Computational modeling","Technological innovation","Organizations","Context","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","small-to-medium enterprises","social aspects of automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing adoption","cloud computing acceptance","cloud computing diffusion","SME"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Adoption","SME"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7594056/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Factors influencing the adoption of cloud computing in SME: A systematic review","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7594056/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"16397487","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"19-20 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factors influencing the adoption of cloud computing in SME: A systematic review","confLoc":"Ipoh, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"IS26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072593S","chronDate":"19-20 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7585846","isNumber":"7594011","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585846","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7594011","articleId":"7594056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7598187,"authors":[{"name":"Cory Merkel","affiliation":["US Air Force Research Laboratory"],"bio":{"p":["Cory Merkel is a research electronics engineer at the US Air Force Research Laboratory's Information Directorate.

Digital Cartesian Feedback (CFB) presents itself as a good linearization system when using narrowband signals in portable or mobile devices. This work starts with the validation of a digital CFB linearization system using a Proportional and Integrative (PI) controller, which is able to decrease spectral side lobes of at least 20dB. Next, non-linearities are added to the elements in the transmission chain in the forward and feedback paths, and the same regulator is used to linearize the system. Finally, the imperfections on the feedback are removed. The results start by validating the digital CFB linearization system, so that different configurations of non-linearities can be simulated and compared. The system operates with 4QAM and 16QAM modulation, raised cosine filter, PA modeled using Salehs equation and a PI regulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7598199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-3 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7598199/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16408469","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Simulink framework for the modeling of Cartesian Feedback Power Amplifier linearization systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulink framework for the modeling of Cartesian Feedback Power Amplifier linearization systems","confLoc":"Belo Horizonte, Brazil","sourcePdf":"26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078253S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 3 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7588216","isNumber":"7598188","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7588216","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7598188","articleId":"7598199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7598202,"authors":[{"name":"Joary Paulo","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Federal University of Par\u00e1, Brazil"],"firstName":"Joary","lastName":"Paulo","id":"37085904466"},{"name":"Igor Freire","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Federal University of Par\u00e1, Brazil"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Freire","id":"37085411110"},{"name":"Ilan Sousa","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Federal University of Par\u00e1, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ilan","lastName":"Sousa","id":"37085685981"},{"name":"Chenguang Lu","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Kista, Sweden"],"lastName":"Chenguang Lu","id":"37085904742"},{"name":"Miguel Berg","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Berg","id":"38667778100"},{"name":"Igor Almeida","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Kista, Sweden"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Almeida","id":"37667452000"},{"name":"Aldebaro Klautau","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Federal University of Par\u00e1, Brazil"],"firstName":"Aldebaro","lastName":"Klautau","id":"37393296500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3302-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3303-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7598202","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":382},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Clocks","Delays","Field programmable gate arrays","Estimation","Phase noise","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","local area networks","optical links","phase noise","radio access networks","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based testbed","synchronization","Ethernet fronthaul","phase noise measurements","cloud radio access network","C-RAN","baseband processing units","CPRI","common public radio interface","OBSAI","open basestation architecture initiative","dedicated optical links","packet delay variation","regenerated clock phase noise"]}],"abstract":"Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is a recent trend of RAN architecture positioned to help the operators to address challenges of new wireless services, such as emerging 4G and 5G mobile networks. C-RAN uses baseband processing units in a central server which connects to the radio front-ends at cell sites via the so-called fronthaul network. The fronthaul infrastructure is currently provided by CPRI (Common Public Radio Interface) and OBSAI (Open Basestation Architecture Initiative) industry standards which use dedicated optical links with high deployment costs. An alternative is to use Ethernet technology aiming to reuse of network infrastructure available in many commercial buildings. However, in contrast to the traditional synchronous fronthaul, Ethernet suffers with packet delay variation (PDV) and challenging synchronization recovery. This work presents a complete and flexible testbed to evaluate Ethernet-based fronthaul.

Instead of stacking transistors or employing large inductive transformation ratios, high output power is generated by switching individual class-D power amplifier (PA) cells in a 2-phase house-of-cards (HoC) topology to provide voltage addition of the cells outputs without exceeding device voltage ratings, effectively resulting in a solid-state RF impedance transformer. High-efficiency at backoff is then achieved by capacitively combining the output of two HoC networks nominally set to generate different amplitudes, enabling voltage-mode Doherty-like backoff without a bulky transmission line. The PA is implemented in 65nm bulk LP CMOS, operates from 4.8V, and provides a battery-to-RF efficiency above 40% at both 23dBm and 6dB backoff at 720MHz.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Impedance","Power generation","Band-pass filters","Topology","Transistors","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","impedance convertors","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-RF power inverter","high-voltage RF waveforms","battery voltage","thin-oxide CMOS switches","large inductive transformation ratios","class-D power amplifier","2-phase house-of-cards topology","voltage addition","solid-state RF impedance transformer","HoC networks","voltage-mode Doherty-like backoff","bulk LP CMOS","size 65 nm","voltage 4.8 V","frequency 720 MHz","efficiency 40 percent"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2016.7598274","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC Conference 2016: 42nd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC Conference 2016: 42nd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585490/7598228/07598274.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7598228","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2016.7598274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A recursive house-of-cards digital power amplifier employing a \u03bb/4-less Doherty power combiner in 65nm CMOS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7598274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A recursive house-of-cards digital power amplifier employing a \u03bb/4-less Doherty power combiner in 65nm CMOS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7598274/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7598274/","accessionNumber":"16397417","conferenceDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A recursive house-of-cards digital power amplifier employing a \u03bb/4-less Doherty power combiner in 65nm CMOS","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"C045-A3L-H3-5111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037545S","chronDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585490","isNumber":"7598228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585490","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7598228","articleId":"7598274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7598275,"authors":[{"name":"Neelanjan Sarmah","affiliation":["IHCT, University of Wuppertal, Wuppertal, Germany"],"firstName":"Neelanjan","lastName":"Sarmah","id":"37846907400"},{"name":"Klaus Aufinger","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Aufinger","id":"37284137300"},{"name":"Rudolf Lachner","affiliation":["Infineon Technologies AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Lachner","id":"37285064500"},{"name":"Ullrich R.

The field probes co-integrate an NMR microcoil and the required transceiver electronics on a single ASIC manufactured in a 0.13\u03bcm CMOS technology. Thanks to an on-chip PLL, power amplifier and low-IF quadrature receiver, all connections to and from the chip carry only low frequency signals allowing for an effective reduction of the magnetic coupling between the field probes and the MRI scanner during imaging. The small form factor and low power consumption of 16.5mW allows for the realization of arrays of field probes, which in contrast to single probes enable the correction of higher order field imperfections. Measured trajectory maps acquired with a prototype array consisting of four probes demonstrate the excellent sensor performance achievable using the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2016.7598281","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC Conference 2016: 42nd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC Conference 2016: 42nd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585490/7598228/07598281.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2016.7598281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7598228","startPage":"217","endPage":"220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An array of fully-integrated quadrature TX/RX NMR field probes for MRI trajectory mapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7598281","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An array of fully-integrated quadrature TX/RX NMR field probes for MRI trajectory mapping","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7598281/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397440","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7598281/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An array of fully-integrated quadrature TX/RX NMR field probes for MRI trajectory mapping","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"C052-A6L-G1-5361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044593S","chronDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585490","isNumber":"7598228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585490","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7598228","articleId":"7598281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7598282,"authors":[{"name":"Ha Le-Thai","affiliation":["ESAT, KU Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ha","lastName":"Le-Thai","id":"38274255800"},{"name":"Adi Xhakoni","affiliation":["ESAT, KU Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Adi","lastName":"Xhakoni","id":"38015293100"},{"name":"Georges Gielen","affiliation":["ESAT, KU Leuven, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Gielen","id":"37364140600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2972-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2973-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7598282","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1255},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS image sensors","Parallel processing","Thermal noise","Layout","Sigma-delta modulation","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["1/f noise","CMOS image sensors","integrated circuit noise","readout electronics","sigma-delta modulation","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["column-and-row-parallel CMOS image sensor architecture","thermal noise suppression technique","1/f noise suppression technique","row-parallel readout ADC structure","top-bottom parallel ADC structure","incremental sigma-delta ADC structure","source-follower inversion-to-accumulation method","CIS technology","digital CDS mode","size 180 nm","voltage 128 muV","time 2.5 mus","power 60 mW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS image sensors (CIS)","incremental sigma-delta","column ADCs","low-noise image sensors","high-speed image sensors","quadrant structure","thermal noise suppression","1/\u0192 noise suppression","parallelism"]}],"abstract":"A CMOS image sensor architecture is presented that uses an extra level of parallelism and thermal and 1/f noise suppression techniques to achieve both low-light detection and a high frame rate.

To this end, we employ a custom designed clock generation unit, capable of immediate glitch-free adjustments of the clock period over a wide range with fine granularity. Our chip measurements in 28nm FD-SOI technology show that DynOR provides an average speedup of 19% in program execution over a wide range of operating conditions, with a peak speedup for certain applications of up to 41%.

This architecture is particulary well suited for MIMO systems where multiple beams are used for increased throughput. Like the FFT, the proposed architecture reuses computations for multi-beam systems. In particular, the proposed architecture redistributes the computations so as to maximize the reuse of the structure that already exist in a receiver chain. In many fashions the architecture is quite similar to a Butler matrix but unlike the Butler matrix it does not use large passive components at RF. Further, we exploit the normally occurring quadrature down-conversion process to implement the tap weights. In comparison to traditional MIMO architectures, that effectively duplicate each path, the distributed computations of this architecture provide partial spatial filtering before the final stage, improving interference rejection for the blocks between the LNA and the ADC. Additionally, because of the spatial filtering prior to the ADC, a single interferer only jams a single beam allowing for continued operation though at a lower combined throughput. The four-beam receiver core prototype in 65nm CMOS implements the basic FFT based architecture but does not include an LNA or extensive IF stages. This four-channel design consumes 56mW power and occupies an active area of 0.65mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n excluding pads and test circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ESSCIRC.2016.7598316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSCIRC.2016.7598316","startPage":"359","endPage":"362","publicationTitle":"ESSCIRC Conference 2016: 42nd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"ESSCIRC Conference 2016: 42nd European Solid-State Circuits Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7585490/7598228/07598316.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7598228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An easily extendable FFT based four-channel, four-beam receiver with progressive partial spatial filtering in 65nm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7598316/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An easily extendable FFT based four-channel, four-beam receiver with progressive partial spatial filtering in 65nm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16408273","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7598316/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An easily extendable FFT based four-channel, four-beam receiver with progressive partial spatial filtering in 65nm","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"C087-B8L-G3-5371.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059599S","chronDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7585490","isNumber":"7598228","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7585490","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7598228","articleId":"7598316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7598324,"authors":[{"name":"M.

State-of-the-art devices are based on the perovskite lead zirconate titanate (PZT), which suffers from CMOS incompatibility resulting in scaling issues. The discovery of the ferroelectricity in doped hafnium oxide enabled scaled 3D memory devices. A variety of dopants has already been found to stabilize the orthorhombic phase, responsible for ferroelectric switching. Interestingly, among the variety of dopants only a mixed hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO) enabled a wide process window together with a large memory window. Here, we compare PZT with HZO and show that despite different dielectric properties similar memory relevant performance can be achieved. Additionally, analogous wake-up and degradation behavior can be observed in both materials. Moreover, we show experimental proof that a thermally driven wake-up in both material systems is caused by diffusion of ionic charges. Extracted activation energy hints to oxygen vacancy movement as the main cause for the wake-up effect in HZO.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7599663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7599663/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397391","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","conferenceDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of hafnia and PZT based ferroelectrics for future non-volatile FRAM applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of hafnia and PZT based ferroelectrics for future non-volatile FRAM applications","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"D089-C2L-D2-5089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062717S","chronDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7584557","isNumber":"7598672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7584557","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7598672","articleId":"7599663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7599664,"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Le Gallo","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Le Gallo","id":"37085513897"},{"name":"Tomas Tuma","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Tomas","lastName":"Tuma","id":"37936814800"},{"name":"Federico Zipoli","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Federico","lastName":"Zipoli","id":"37085771316"},{"name":"Abu Sebastian","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Abu","lastName":"Sebastian","id":"37320446800"},{"name":"Evangelos Eleftheriou","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich, Ruschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Evangelos","lastName":"Eleftheriou","id":"37085461735"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2969-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2970-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-6558"}],"articleNumber":"7599664","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":462},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Phase change materials","Delays","Threshold voltage","Crystallization","Electrodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase change memories","random number generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase-change memory devices","two terminal nanoscale device","inherent stochasticity","threshold switching","memory switching","atomic configurations","melt-quench process","RESET operation","random number generator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7599664","abstract":"A two terminal nanoscale device showing inherent stochastic behavior can be a key enabler for a wide range of applications such as stochastic computing, machine learning and neuromorphic engineering.

For example, analog tuning of the memory state combined with high integration density of memristors is needed for very compact implementation of synapses, the most numerous devices in artificial neural networks and would be essential for low energy implementations of large-scale neuromorphic circuits. One way to increase effective memristor density is by vertical monolithical integration of memristor crossbar circuits. Previous work on such circuits have focused on their use for digital memory applications. Only limited device statistics was typically reported, not sufficient for understanding prospects for computing applications. Here we report fabrication and detailed characterization results for a bilayer stacked metal-oxide memristor crossbar circuits. The experimental results show excellent uniformity for the memristors in both crossbar layers. Moreover, the utilized low temperature process flow is CMOS compatible and can be extended to multi-layer stacking.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memristors","Switches","Fabrication","Electrodes","Three-dimensional displays","Performance evaluation","Sputtering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","neural nets","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer ReRAM crossbar circuits","resistive switching memories","neuromorphic computing","logic-in-memory computing","memristors integration density","artificial neural networks","neuromorphic circuits","metal oxide memristor crossbar circuits"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RRAM","metal-oxide memristor","vertical integration","passive crossbar circuits","3D circuits"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7599679","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2016.7599679","startPage":"436","endPage":"439","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7584557/7598672/07599679.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7598672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2016.7599679","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7599679/","displayDocTitle":"Highly-uniform multi-layer ReRAM crossbar circuits","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16397362","htmlLink":"/document/7599679/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Highly-uniform multi-layer ReRAM crossbar circuits","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"D105-C6L-D2-5352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052772S","chronDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7584557","isNumber":"7598672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7584557","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7598672","articleId":"7599679","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7599680,"authors":[{"name":"Severin Sidler","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland","IBM Research-Almaden, San Jose, CA"],"firstName":"Severin","lastName":"Sidler","id":"37085650550"},{"name":"Irem Boybat","affiliation":["IBM Research-Almaden, San Jose, CA","EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Irem","lastName":"Boybat","id":"37270366700"},{"name":"Robert M.

Toward this, shallow arch shaped microresonators are electrically connected and their resonance frequencies are tuned based on an electrothermal frequency modulation scheme. This study demonstrates that by reconfiguring the same basic building block, the arch microresonator, complex logic circuits can be realized.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microelectromechanical resonator based digital logic elements","publicationTitle":"2016 46th European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","doi":"10.1109/ESSDERC.2016.7599682","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 46th European Solid-State Device Research Conference (ESSDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7584557/7598672/07599682.pdf","startPage":"448","endPage":"451","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESSDERC.2016.7599682","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7598672","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7599682","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7599682/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Microelectromechanical resonator based digital logic elements","conferenceDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7599682/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16397385","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microelectromechanical resonator based digital logic elements","confLoc":"Lausanne, Switzerland","sourcePdf":"D108-C7L-D2-5353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065909S","chronDate":"12-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7584557","isNumber":"7598672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7584557","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7598672","articleId":"7599682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"}]
