This characteristic is a function of the undersea environment. Using a multisensor active sonar problem, we examine the performance of track management (confirmation and termination) routines where target detections are based on an underlying hidden Markov model (HMM) with high and low detection states. Rule-based track confirmation tests are compared including M/N rules and rules that differentiate the measurements by receiver source (M/N from at least C sensors), each of which is suboptimal compared with a fixed-length likelihood ratio test. We show that significant performance improvements (to near-optimal) can be obtained using a composite track confirmation test that combines two or three such rules in a logical OR operation. Track termination tests are next compared, and it is shown that a Bayesian sequential test (the Shiryaev test) yields dramatic performance improvements over a K/N track termination rule and the Page test. The model-based results are validated using simulations of a multisensor tracking scenario. The results of this paper are informed by a multisensor sonar application. However, targets may fade in and out of view in other modalities as well, due to aspect-dependent radar cross-section or occlusion. As such, our suggestions for improved HMM-modulated SNR track initiation and termination apply to multisensor radar target tracking as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5310298/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2009","volume":"45","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"11071090","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5310298/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multisensor Track Management for Targets with Fluctuating SNR","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multisensor Track Management for Targets with Fluctuating SNR","sourcePdf":"45aes04-Blanding.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050662S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5310295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5310295","articleId":"5310298","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5310305,"authors":[{"name":"J.

On the other hand, a characteristic critical classification problem, for which the standard approaches do not properly work, is presented. Two classification schemes are proposed for this situation, the first one based on coherent matched masks and the second one based on incoherent masks where a robustness parameter has also been defined.

The use of measured Doppler information directly in the target trajectory estimation leads to a nonlinear filter implementation such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF), particle filter etc. We investigate a method for including Doppler measurements as part of the data association process and then assess the benefits of this approach. It is well understood that data association performance can dominate the total performance of a tracker that is designed to track targets in the presence of clutter. In this case, the Doppler component of the measurements may be used in combination with the target position measurement as an additional discriminant of measurement origin. We have developed a simple but efficient Doppler data association (DDA) method which utilises both position and Doppler measurements for single and multi-target tracking. If the Doppler measurements are not used in trajectory state estimation, then the nonlinear filters for the incorporation of Doppler measurements are not required, however a significant improvement in tracking performance is still observed. The proposed DDA method is demonstrated using both the linear multi-target integrated probabilistic data association algorithm (LMIPDA) and the linear multi-target integrated track splitting algorithm (LMITS) in an active sonar underwater multi-target tracking scenario.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Doppler measurements","Radar tracking","Target tracking","Position measurement","Underwater tracking","Sonar measurements","State estimation","Trajectory","Nonlinear filters","Doppler radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Kalman filters","nonlinear filters","particle filtering (numerical methods)","probability","radar tracking","sensor fusion","sonar tracking","target tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced multi-target tracking","Doppler measurements","radar tracking systems","sonar tracking systems","time sequence","Doppler information","target trajectory estimation","nonlinear filter","extended Kalman filter","particle filter","data association process","Doppler data association","linear multi-target integrated probabilistic data association algorithm","multi-target integrated track splitting algorithm"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5310307","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5310295/05310307.pdf","startPage":"1400","endPage":"1417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5310295","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5310307","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient and Enhanced Multi-Target Tracking with Doppler Measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5310307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient and Enhanced Multi-Target Tracking with Doppler Measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5310307/","volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5310307/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11071088","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient and Enhanced Multi-Target Tracking with Doppler Measurements","sourcePdf":"45aes04-Wang2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092788S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5310295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5310295","articleId":"5310307","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5310309,"authors":[{"name":"Darko Musicki","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Information Systems Engineering, University of Hangyang, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5310295/5310309/5310309-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Darko Mu\u0161icki was born in Belgrade, Serbia, in 1957.

The approach presented in this paper follows the previously published integrated track splitting (ITS) framework which integrates a recursive calculation of the probability of target existence with multiscan trajectory estimation. This paper combines this framework with two multitarget tracking techniques. The first technique, joint multitarget tracking, enumerates and evaluates all feasible global measurement to track assignments resulting in a conditionally optimal but potentially computationally expensive technique. The second technique, linear multitarget (LM), achieves multitarget functionality by modulating clutter measurement density. LM is a suboptimal, but computationally very efficient technique. A simulation study is presented to show the effectiveness of this approach in the presence of nonuniform clutter when tracking targets in an environment where the targets perform violent manoeuvres.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5310309/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2009","htmlLink":"/document/5310309/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11071073","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multiscan Multitarget Tracking in Clutter with Integrated Track Splitting Filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiscan Multitarget Tracking in Clutter with Integrated Track Splitting Filter","sourcePdf":"45aes04-Musicki.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089995S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5310295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"5310295","articleId":"5310309","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5310326,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Liu","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37291889300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"5310326","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":794},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Autocorrelation","Application specific processors","Chirp modulation","Pulse modulation","Frequency modulation","Bandwidth","Gratings","Genetic algorithms","Brain modeling","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","numerical analysis","radar theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal discrete frequency-coding waveform set design","minimized autocorrelation sidelobes","autocorrelation sidelobe peak levels","linear frequency modulated","autocorrelation function","cross-correlation function","frequency firing order","genetic algorithm","numerically search optimal frequency firing order"]}],"abstract":"The autocorrelation sidelobe peak (ASP) levels of discrete frequency-coding waveform with fixed frequency pulses (DFCW-FF) is very large, which is about 0.21 or -13.2 dB. Replacing the fixed frequency pulses with linear frequency modulated (LFM) pulses can lower the ASP. We investigate the autocorrelation function (ACF) and cross-correlation function (CCF) for DFCW with arbitrary frequency firing order. It is shown that DFCW-LFM has different ACF expression from the DFCW-FF, and the CCF of DFCW-LFM changes distinctly with different frequency firing order. By setting the relationships between the frequency step \u00bff, LFM bandwidth B and subpulse duration T, we can reduce the ASP, as well as nullify the grating lobes. Then, a modified genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to numerically search optimal frequency firing order for DFCW-LFM. Some of the designed results are presented. Their correlation properties are effectively improved. Both simulation results and comparisons show that the method of mitigating ASP and the proposed search algorithm are effective for the design of DFCWs with superior aperiodic correlation.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5310326","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5310295/05310326.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5310326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5310295","startPage":"1650","endPage":"1657","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal Discrete Frequency-Coding Waveform Set Design with Minimized Autocorrelation Sidelobes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5310326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal Discrete Frequency-Coding Waveform Set Design with Minimized Autocorrelation Sidelobes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5310326/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"11071081","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5310326/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal Discrete Frequency-Coding Waveform Set Design with Minimized Autocorrelation Sidelobes","sourcePdf":"45aes04-Liu-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067425S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5310295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"5310295","articleId":"5310326","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5310327,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The employment of an interleaver together with a precoding matrix whose size does not depend on the number of data carriers in an OFDM symbol allows different configurations of time-frequency diversity which can be easily adapted to the channel conditions.

In an episode of myocardial ischemia, acidosis and elevation of potassium ion concentration has been observed in the extra-cellular matrix of the myocardium. As a spectrum of markers, they can help detect onset of ischemia as well as infarctions. In this study, Flexible Organic Ion-Sensitive Field-Effect Transistors (ISFETs) have been characterized to detect Ischemia-like variations in pH and potassium ion concentration. Detection capabilities, of the sensors, have been shown as pure chemical concentration to current signal transduction of the ISFET. Independent of peripheral amplifier-converter circuits, they are standalone sensors. The sensors have been evaluated for their sensitivity and signal resolution. Calibration expression, following a thermo-electric model for device operation, represents an explicit relations between transistor drain current and ion concentrations. Signal conditioning, by normalization, has been attempted to make the calibration expression explicit in ion-concentration. Finally a reliable detection strategy, in differential mode, is proposed for a reference electrode free device.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2009.2032525","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5290388/05310974.pdf","startPage":"1987","endPage":"1995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2009.2032525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5290388","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Drain Current Centric Modality: Instrumentation and Evaluation of ISFET for Monitoring Myocardial Ischemia Like Variations in pH and Potassium Ion Concentration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5310974","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5310974/","displayDocTitle":"Drain Current Centric Modality: Instrumentation and Evaluation of ISFET for Monitoring Myocardial Ischemia Like Variations in pH and Potassium Ion Concentration","volume":"9","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10992014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5310974/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Drain Current Centric Modality: Instrumentation and Evaluation of ISFET for Monitoring Myocardial Ischemia Like Variations in pH and Potassium Ion Concentration","sourcePdf":"jsen-prai-2032525.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148295S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5290388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5290388","articleId":"5310974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5310989,"authors":[{"name":"Jin-Fu Lin","affiliation":["National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5290388/5310989/5310989-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jin-Fu Lin (S'09) was born in Changhua, Taiwan, in 1981.

A proposed method assigns subcarriers from users not satisfying QoS to users who can contribute to system capacity.","doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2009.5312791","publicationTitle":"2009 18th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 18th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5299298/5312781/05312791.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2009.5312791","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of adaptive subcarrier allocation scheme to support QoS in Multiuser OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5312791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5312791/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of adaptive subcarrier allocation scheme to support QoS in Multiuser OFDM system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10964826","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5312791/","conferenceDate":"1-2 May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of adaptive subcarrier allocation scheme to support QoS in Multiuser OFDM system","confLoc":"Newark, NJ, USA","sourcePdf":"WOCC2009I07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039411S","chronDate":"1-2 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5299298","isNumber":"5312781","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5299298","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5312781","articleId":"5312791","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5312792,"authors":[{"name":"Xiang Zhou","affiliation":["AT and T Research Laboratories, Middletown, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37280487800"},{"name":"Jianjun Yu","affiliation":["NEC Laboratories of America, Inc., Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Yu","id":"37278392400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5217-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2379-1268"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2379-1276"}],"articleNumber":"5312792","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1554},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5312792","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","Optical fiber communication","Signal processing algorithms","Frequency estimation","Chromatic dispersion","Optical polarization","Polarization mode dispersion","Phase estimation","Optical distortion","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","frequency estimation","light polarisation","optical dispersion","optical receivers","photodetectors","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing","coherent optical communication","digital equalization algorithm","chromatic dispersion compensation","polarization recovery","polarization mode dispersion compensation","carrier frequency offset estimation","carrier phase recovery","distortion mitigation algorithm","coherent receiver","single-ended photodetection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DSP","Coherent","algorithm","optical","detection","communication"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WOCC.2009.5312792","endPage":"5","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2009 18th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 18th Annual Wireless and Optical Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5299298/5312781/05312792.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCC.2009.5312792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5312781","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital signal processing for coherent optical communication","abstract":"In this paper we review several digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms recently proposed (or introduced) for coherent optical communication system.

General CRFs worked well on POS tagging, but met difficulty when dealing with a large training dataset and tag set because of high computation cost for training. CCRFs organize all tags in a hierarchy and run CRFs on each node of the hierarchy. In CCRFs framework, similar tags were treated as the same one in an upper layer, while they were distinguished in lower layer with more information from upper layer. The analysis of computation complexity shows that CCRFs can highly reduce both space complexity and time complexity for training. The experiments show that CCRFs can deal with large data sets from SIGHAN 2008 with common PCs, which cannot be handled by general CRFs under the same computational condition. Furthermore, we try to keep the good performance of CCRFs for POS tagging by selecting proper features for hierarchical POS tags clustering and introducing more rich and accurate features in the training and tagging phases. The final results show that CCRFs outperform maximum entropy model on all the three test datasets, and outperform enhanced maximum entropy model on the two of the three datasets.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5306518/5313726/05313733.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Engineering","doi":"10.1109/NLPKE.2009.5313733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NLPKE.2009.5313733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5313726","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313733","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CCRFs: Cascaded conditional random fields for Chinese POS tagging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tagging","Hidden Markov models","Entropy","Labeling","Natural language processing","National electric code","Laboratories","Technological innovation","Natural languages","Computational efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","natural language processing","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CCRF","cascaded conditional random field","Chinese POS tag clustering","part-of-speech tagging","computation complexity","space complexity","time complexity","maximum entropy model","NLP processing","natural language processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cascaded Conditional Random Fields","Chinese POS tagging","Natural Language Processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-27 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"CCRFs: Cascaded conditional random fields for Chinese POS tagging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5313733/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10964100","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"24-27 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CCRFs: Cascaded conditional random fields for Chinese POS tagging","confLoc":"Dalian, China","sourcePdf":"96.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064648S","chronDate":"24-27 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5306518","isNumber":"5313726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5306518","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5313726","articleId":"5313733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5313764,"authors":[{"name":"Batuer Aisha","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Technology State Key Laboratory on Intelligent Technology & Sys, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Batuer","lastName":"Aisha","id":"37681630000"},{"name":"Maosong Sun","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Intelligent Technology & Sys National Laboratory of Information Science & Tech, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Maosong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37278329200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4538-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4540-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5313764","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical analysis","Natural languages","Morphology","Testing","Shape","Automata","Automatic frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical method","Uyghur tokenization","Uyghur language processing","agglutinative language","feature template scheme","manually tokenized corpora"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Xinjiang","Uyghur","Morpheme","Uyghur Suffix","Uyghur letter","MEM"]}],"abstract":"Tokenization is very important for Uyghur language processing.

In this paper, we describe the architectures of two parallel decimal multipliers. The parallel generation of partial products is performed using signed-digit radix-10 or radix-5 recodings of the multiplier and a simplified set of multiplicand multiples. The reduction of partial products is implemented in a tree structure based on a decimal multioperand carry-save addition algorithm that uses unconventional (non BCD) decimal-coded number systems. We further detail these techniques and present the new improvements to reduce the latency of the previous designs, which include: optimized digit recoders for the generation of 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n-tuples (and 5-tuples), decimal carry-save adders (CSAs) combining different decimal-coded operands, and carry-free adders implemented by special designed bit counters. Moreover, we detail a design methodology that combines all these techniques to obtain efficient reduction trees with different area and delay trade-offs for any number of partial products generated. Evaluation results for 16-digit operands show that the proposed architectures have interesting area-delay figures compared to conventional Booth radix-4 and radix--8 parallel binary multipliers and outperform the figures of previous alternatives for decimal multiplication.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5437556/05313798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5437556","startPage":"679","endPage":"693","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Design of High-Performance Parallel Decimal Multipliers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313798","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved Design of High-Performance Parallel Decimal Multipliers","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11206187","dateOfInsertion":"25 March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5313798/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Design of High-Performance Parallel Decimal Multipliers","sourcePdf":"ttc2010050679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088831S","chronDate":"May  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5437556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5437556","articleId":"5313798","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5313800,"authors":[{"name":"Animesh Pathak","affiliation":["University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/5470966/5313800/5313800-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Animesh Pathak received the BTech degree in computer science and engineering from the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu University, India, in 2003, and the PhD degree in computer engineering from the University of Southern California in 2008.

However, determining an energy-efficient initial placement of these tasks onto the nodes of the target network poses a set of interesting problems. We present a framework to model this task-mapping problem arising in WSN macroprogramming. Our model can capture placement constraints in tasks, as well as multiple possible routes in the target network. Using our framework, we provide mathematical formulations for the task-mapping problem for two different metrics-energy balance and total energy spent. For both metrics, we address scenarios where (1) a single or (2) multiple paths are possible between nodes. Due to the complex nature of the problems, these formulations are not linear. We provide linearization heuristics for the same, resulting in mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We also provide efficient heuristics for the above. Our experiments show that our heuristics give the same results as the MIP for real-world sensor network macroprograms, and show a speedup of up to several orders of magnitude. We also provide worst-case performance bounds of the heuristics.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5470966/05313800.pdf","startPage":"955","endPage":"968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5470966","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Task Mapping for Data-Driven Sensor Network Macroprogramming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313800","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313800/","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Task Mapping for Data-Driven Sensor Network Macroprogramming","volume":"59","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11350060","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5313800/","dateOfInsertion":"24 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Task Mapping for Data-Driven Sensor Network Macroprogramming","sourcePdf":"ttc2010070955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078411S","chronDate":"July  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5470966","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5470966","articleId":"5313800","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5313806,"authors":[{"name":"Ruiqiang Guo","affiliation":["College of Mathematics & Information Science, Hebei Normal University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China"],"firstName":"Ruiqiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"37552012200"},{"name":"Fuji Ren","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"firstName":"Fuji","lastName":"Ren","id":"37301478200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4538-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-4540-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5313806","dbTime":"72 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":561},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semantic Web","Ontologies","Information retrieval","Resource description framework","Data mining","Natural language processing","OWL","Educational institutions","Mathematics","Information science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","semantic Web"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","semantic Web development","ontology learning","ontology query","multilingual ontology mapping","semantic Web technology","information extraction","word sense disambiguation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Semantic Web","NLP","Ontology"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313806","abstract":"With the development of Semantic the Web technology, the NLP technology has much broader prospects.

Most previous work assumed that a worm always propagates itself at the highest possible speed. Some newly developed worms (e.g., \u201cAtak\u201d worm) contradict this assumption by deliberately reducing the propagation speed in order to avoid detection. As such, we study a new class of worms, referred to as self-disciplinary worms. These worms adapt their propagation patterns in order to reduce the probability of detection, and eventually, to infect more computers. We demonstrate that existing worm detection schemes based on traffic volume and variance cannot effectively defend against these self-disciplinary worms. To develop proper countermeasures, we introduce a game-theoretic formulation to model the interaction between the worm propagator and the defender. We show that an effective integration of multiple countermeasure schemes (e.g., worm detection and forensics analysis) is critical for defending against self-disciplinary worms. We propose different integrated schemes for fighting different self-disciplinary worms, and evaluate their performance via real-world traffic data.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2009.161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2009.161","startPage":"1501","endPage":"1514","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5556484/05313807.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5556484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Disciplinary Worms and Countermeasures: Modeling and Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Self-Disciplinary Worms and Countermeasures: Modeling and Analysis","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"23 August 2010","volume":"21","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5313807/","accessionNumber":"11487054","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313807/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Disciplinary Worms and Countermeasures: Modeling and Analysis","sourcePdf":"ttd2010101501.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116272S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5556484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5556484","articleId":"5313807","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5313818,"authors":[{"name":"Valent\u00cdn de la Rubia","affiliation":["Departamento de Tecnolog\u00eda de los Computadores y de las Comunicaciones, Escuela Polit\u00e9cnica de C\u00e1ceres, Universidad de Extremadura, Caceres, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5340252/5313818/5313818-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Valent\u00edn de la Rubia was born in Ciudad Real, Spain, in 1980.

Contrary to what one may expect by observing the frequency response of different microwave circuits, the electromagnetic field within these devices does not drastically vary as frequency changes in a band of interest. Thus, instead of using computationally inefficient, large dimension, numerical approximations such as finite- or boundary-element methods for each frequency in the band, the point in here is to approximate the dynamics of the electromagnetic field itself as frequency changes. A much lower dimension, reduced-basis approximation sorts this problem out. Not only rapid frequency evaluation of the reduced-order model is carried out within this approach, but also special emphasis is placed on a fast determination of the error measure for each frequency in the band of interest. This certifies the accurate response of the reduced-order model. The same scheme allows us, in an offline stage, to adaptively select the basis functions in the reduced-basis approximation and automatically select the model-order reduction process whenever a preestablished accuracy is required throughout the band of interest. Finally, real-life applications will illustrate the capabilities of this approach.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2034208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5340252/05313818.pdf","startPage":"2923","endPage":"2937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2034208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliable Fast Frequency Sweep for Microwave Devices via the Reduced-Basis Method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313818/","displayDocTitle":"Reliable Fast Frequency Sweep for Microwave Devices via the Reduced-Basis Method","volume":"57","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11019187","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5313818/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliable Fast Frequency Sweep for Microwave Devices via the Reduced-Basis Method","sourcePdf":"tmtt-delarubia-part1-2034208.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155971S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5340252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"5340252","articleId":"5313818","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5313822,"authors":[{"name":"Jinseong Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/5340253/5313822/5313822-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jinseong Jeong (S'01\u2013M'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, in 1996, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), in 2002 and 2006, respectively.","From 1996 to 1999, he was with Seodu InChip Inc., Seoul, Korea, where he developed several CDMA baseband chipsets for IMT-2000 and wireless local loops (WLLs).

When the envelope tracking technique is applied to broadband signals such as WCDMA and 3GPP LTE, the wide bandwidth of the envelope signal makes it difficult to implement the dynamic supply modulator efficiently and accurately. We show here a technique to reduce the bandwidth of the power supply waveform, thereby allowing better efficiency for the supply modulator; and a linearization method for correcting the nonlinearity caused by the bandwidth reduction. The feasibility of this technique is demonstrated for a single carrier WCDMA signal with a 7.6-dB peak-to-average power ratio using a GaAs high-voltage HBT PA. The bandwidth of the power supply waveform is reduced from 20 to 4 MHz. After linearization, the reduced bandwidth envelope tracking PA exhibits an average output power of 28 W, an average gain of 12 dB and an overall power-added efficiency of 49%. The measured normalized rms error is as low as 0.67% with an adjacent channel leakage ratio of -53.9 and -54.2 dBc at offset frequencies of 5 and 10 MHz, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TMTT.2009.2033298","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel5/22/5340253/05313822.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5340253","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMTT.2009.2033298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","startPage":"3307","endPage":"3314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wideband Envelope Tracking Power Amplifiers With Reduced Bandwidth Power Supply Waveforms and Adaptive Digital Predistortion Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313822","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Wideband Envelope Tracking Power Amplifiers With Reduced Bandwidth Power Supply Waveforms and Adaptive Digital Predistortion Techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313822/","volume":"57","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5313822/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"11007359","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wideband Envelope Tracking Power Amplifiers With Reduced Bandwidth Power Supply Waveforms and Adaptive Digital Predistortion Techniques","sourcePdf":"57tmtt12-jjeong-part2-2033298.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076691S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"5340253","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"5340253","articleId":"5313822","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5313828,"authors":[{"name":"Adam B.

The four-element array results in an average gain of ~ 0 dB per channel and a noise figure of 9.0 dB, and is designed to be placed behind III-V T/R modules. The rms phase error is 5.6\u00b0 (5-bit operation) and < 12.5\u00b0 (4-bit operation) over a 2 or 5 GHz instantaneous bandwidth, respectively, centered at around 36.5 GHz. In the receive mode, the input P1dB is -16 dBm per channel (IIP3 of - 5.9 dBm), and in the transmit mode, the output P1dB is +4-5 dBm, all at 35-36 GHz. The measured isolation between the channels is better than 30 dB. The array maintained excellent phase characteristics up to 100\u00b0C with no change in the rms phase error.

A common joint information state supplied to each of the agents leads to a tractable recursion, as is evident in the one-step-delayed information sharing structure case or when deterministic nestedness in information holds when there is a causality relationship as in the case of partially nested information structure. However, communication requirements for such conditions require exchange of very large data noiselessly, hence these assumptions are generally impractical. In this paper, we present a weaker notion of nestedness, which we term as stochastic nestedness, which is characterized by a sequence of Markov chain conditions. It is shown that if the information structure is stochastically nested, then an optimization problem is tractable, and in particular for LQG problems, the team optimal solution is linear, despite the lack of deterministic nestedness or partial nestedness. One other contribution of this paper is that, by regarding the multiple decision makers as a single decision maker and using Witsenhausen's equivalent model for discrete-stochastic control, it is shown that the common state required need not consist of observations and it suffices to share beliefs on the state and control actions; a pattern we refer to as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</i>\n-\n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">stage belief sharing pattern</i>\n.

Then, according to the location of this error vector, a selection process of the next applied vector is used to minimize the error vector.

This paper is concerned with the passivity and passification problems of the stochastic discrete-time T-S fuzzy systems with delay. We first propose the definition of passivity in the sense of expectation. Then, by utilizing the Lyapunov functional method, the stochastic analysis combined with the matrix inequality techniques, a sufficient condition in terms of linear matrix inequalities is presented, ensuring the passivity performance of the T-S fuzzy models. Finally, based on this criterion, state feedback controller is designed, and several criteria are obtained to make the closed-loop system passive in the sense of expectation. The results acquired in this paper are delay dependent in the sense that they depend on not only the lower bound but also the upper bound of the time-varying delay. Numerical examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of our criteria. </para>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5464482/05313871.pdf","startPage":"964","endPage":"969","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2033142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2009.2033142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5464482","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313871","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Passivity and Passification of Stochastic Fuzzy Systems With Delays: The Discrete-Time Case","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic systems","Fuzzy systems","Delay systems","Linear matrix inequalities","Fuzzy sets","Nonlinear systems","Stochastic processes","Performance analysis","Sufficient conditions","State feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete-time fuzzy system","linear matrix inequality (LMI)","Lyapunov functional","passivity","stochastic disturbance","time-varying delay"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Fuzzy Logic","Models, Statistical","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313871/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Passivity and Passification of Stochastic Fuzzy Systems With Delays: The Discrete-Time Case","volume":"40","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5313871/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","pubMedId":"19900851","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Passivity and Passification of Stochastic Fuzzy Systems With Delays: The Discrete-Time Case","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-wang-2033142-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056205S","chronDate":"June  2010","isNumber":"5464482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"73","articleId":"5313871","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5313872,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Song","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Iowa, Iowa, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/5464482/5313872/5313872-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhe Song (M'08) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from China University of Petroleum, Dongying, China, in 2001 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Iowa, Iowa City, in 2008.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Business Administration Department, School of Business, Nanjing University.

Our analysis shows that (i) about 1 meter spatial separation of fiber-fed transmitter antennas is optimum and results in the maximized system performance and (ii) the maximum tolerable optical power imbalance in two fiber optic links is about 6 dB.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2036190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5371803/05313914.pdf","startPage":"187","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2036190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5371803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Optical Loss and Antenna Separation in 2-2 MIMO Fiber-Radio Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313914","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313914/","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Optical Loss and Antenna Separation in 2<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex></formula>2 MIMO Fiber-Radio Systems","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11069042","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5313914/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Optical Loss and Antenna Separation in 2<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$\\,\\times\\,$</tex></formula>2 MIMO Fiber-Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tap-akobyakov-2036190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059918S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5371803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5371803","articleId":"5313914","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5313917,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Wang","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory of Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37407534700"},{"name":"Yuhua Li","affiliation":["Wuhan National Laboratory of Optoelectronics, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Yuhua","lastName":"Li","id":"37066649700"},{"name":"Changrui Liao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Changrui","lastName":"Liao","id":"37399421200"},{"name":"D.

We examine arrays of bunny-ear antennas and discuss the capabilities and limitations of differential antenna technology. As we focus on radio astronomical applications, the absence of a balancing-feed circuit not only reduces the first-stage noise contribution associated to losses in the feed, but also leads to a cost reduction. Common-modes are supported by the antenna structure when a third conductor is present, such as a ground plane. We demonstrate that anomalies may occur in the differential-mode scan impedance. Knowledge of both types of scan impedances, differential and common mode, is required to properly design differential LNAs and to achieve optimal receiver sensitivity. A compromise solution is proposed based on the partial suppression of the undesired common-mode currents through a (low loss) balancing-dissipation technique. A fully steerable design up to 45\u00b0 in both principal planes is achieved.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2036193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5371803/05313927.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2036193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5371803","startPage":"68","endPage":"78","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study and Design of a Differentially-Fed Tapered Slot Antenna Array","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313927","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Study and Design of a Differentially-Fed Tapered Slot Antenna Array","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313927/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11037524","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5313927/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study and Design of a Differentially-Fed Tapered Slot Antenna Array","sourcePdf":"tap-edeleraacedo-2036193.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102445S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5371803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"5371803","articleId":"5313927","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":5313929,"authors":[{"name":"Holger Pawlak","affiliation":["OHB-System AG, Bremen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/5371803/5313929/5313929-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Holger Pawlak (S'01\u2013M'04) was born in Salzgitter, Germany, in 1976.

The antenna can operate in two different selectable linear polarization bases, thus being capable of reconfiguring/rotating its polarization base from vertical/horizontal (0\u00b0/90\u00b0), to slant \u00b145\u00b0. The antenna has been implemented on a quartz substrate, and uses monolithically integrated micro-electromechanical (MEM) switches to select between the two aforementioned polarization bases. The antenna operates at 3.8 GHz and presents a fractional bandwidth of 1.7%. The interest of the proposed antenna is two-fold. First, in LOS scenarios, the antenna enables polarization tracking in polarization-sensitive communication schemes. Second, there are the gains of using it in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system employing orthogonal space-time block codes (OSTBC) to improve the diversity order/gain of the system in NLOS conditions. These benefits were verified through channel measurements conducted in LOS and NLOS propagation scenarios. Despite the simplicity of the antenna, the achievable polarization matching gains (in LOS scenarios) and diversity gains (in NLOS scenarios) are remarkable. These gains come at no expenses of introducing additional receive ports to the system (increasing the number of radio-frequency (RF) transceivers), rather as a result of the reconfigurable capabilities of the proposed antenna.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2009.2036197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel5/8/5371803/05313931.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2009.2036197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5371803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Dual-Linearly-Polarized MEMS-Reconfigurable Antenna for Narrowband MIMO Communication Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313931","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313931/","displayDocTitle":"A Dual-Linearly-Polarized MEMS-Reconfigurable Antenna for Narrowband MIMO Communication Systems","volume":"58","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2010","accessionNumber":"11069046","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5313931/","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Dual-Linearly-Polarized MEMS-Reconfigurable Antenna for Narrowband MIMO Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"tap-grau-2036197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090343S","chronDate":"Jan.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"5371803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5371803","articleId":"5313931","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5313934,"authors":[{"name":"Kevin J.

The algorithms also allow for aggressive vectorization (even for non-power-of-2 orders) and easier optimization of trivial twiddle factor multiplies. We benchmark \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">G</i>\n and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">GT</i>\n implementations with comparable Cooley-Tukey implementations on commodity hardware. In a comparison designed to isolate the effect of twiddle factor access optimization, these benchmarks show typical speedups ranging from 10% to 65%, depending on transform order, precision, and vectorization. A more heavily optimized implementation of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">GT</i>\n yields substantial performance improvements over the widely used code FFTW for many transform orders.

It is assumed that all the relay nodes are equipped with finite impulse response (FIR) filters and use a filter-and-forward (FF) strategy to compensate for the transmitter-to-relay and relay-to-destination channels. Three relevant half-duplex distributed beamforming problems are considered. The first problem amounts to minimizing the total relay transmitted power subject to the destination quality-of-service (QoS) constraint. In the second and third problems, the destination QoS is maximized subject to the total and individual relay transmitted power constraints, respectively. For the first and second problems, closed-form solutions are obtained, whereas the third problem is solved using convex optimization. The latter convex optimization technique can be also directly extended to the case when the individual and total power constraints should be jointly taken into account. Simulation results demonstrate that in the frequency selective fading case, the proposed FF approach provides substantial performance improvements as compared to the commonly used amplify-and-forward (AF) relay beamforming strategy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal

The MIMO channel is modeled by a multi-dimensional autoregressive (AR) system. The transmitted signals are assumed to take values from a finite alphabet, modeled by the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with infinitesimal variances. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for estimation of the MIMO-AR model parameters is derived. The performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of probability of error in signal detection and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the system parameters and system transfer function estimates is evaluated via simulations. It is shown that the obtained probability of error is very close to the probability of error of the optimal algorithm which assumes known channel state information.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2036043","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05313940.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2036043","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","startPage":"990","endPage":"1000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind MIMO-AR System Identification and Source Separation With Finite-Alphabet","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313940","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind MIMO-AR System Identification and Source Separation With Finite-Alphabet","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313940/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11136162","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5313940/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind MIMO-AR System Identification and Source Separation With Finite-Alphabet","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-trouttenberg-2036043.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056483S","chronDate":"March  2010","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","articleId":"5313940","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5313941,"authors":[{"name":"Caijun Zhong","affiliation":["ECIT, Queen''s University Belfast, Belfast, UK"],"firstName":"Caijun","lastName":"Zhong","id":"37391285800"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Shi","lastName":"Jin","id":"37290425400"},{"name":"Kai-Kit Wong","affiliation":[" CISG, University College London, UK"],"firstName":"Kai-Kit","lastName":"Wong","id":"37278682500"},{"name":"Matthew R.

Since the time-varying nature of the channel is well captured in the CE-BEM by the known exponential basis functions, the time variations of the (unknown) BEM coefficients are likely much slower than those of the channel, and thus more convenient to track. We propose a \u00bfsubblockwise\u00bf tracking scheme for the BEM coefficients using time-multiplexed (TM) periodically transmitted training symbols. Three adaptive algorithms, including a Kalman filtering scheme based on an assumed autoregressive (AR) model of the BEM coefficients, and two recursive least-squares (RLS) schemes not requiring any model for the BEM coefficients, are investigated for BEM coefficient tracking. Simulation examples illustrate the superior performance of our approach over several existing doubly selective channel estimators.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05313942.pdf","startPage":"1275","endPage":"1289","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2036047","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2036047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Doubly Selective Channel Estimation Using Exponential Basis Models and Subblock Tracking","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Kalman filters","Filtering","Time-varying channels","Adaptive algorithm","Adaptive filters","Resonance light scattering","Frequency","Channel state information"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","channel estimation","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly selective channel estimation","subblock tracking","adaptive channel estimation approach","oversampled complex exponential basis expansion model","channel tap gains","time-varying channel","time-multiplexed periodically transmitted training symbols","Kalman filtering scheme","autoregressive model","recursive least-squares schemes","BEM coefficient tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive channel estimation","basis expansion models","doubly selective channels","Kalman filtering","recursive least-squares"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Doubly Selective Channel Estimation Using Exponential Basis Models and Subblock Tracking","volume":"58","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5313942/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11136155","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doubly Selective Channel Estimation Using Exponential Basis Models and Subblock Tracking","sourcePdf":"58tsp03-jtugnait-2036047.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100963S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5313942","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5313943,"authors":[{"name":"Mike Novey","affiliation":["University of Maryland Baltimore County, Catonsville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Novey","id":"37565798600"},{"name":"T\u00fclay Adali","affiliation":["University of Maryland Baltimore County, Catonsville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"T\u00fclay","lastName":"Adali","id":"37284803700"},{"name":"Anindya Roy","affiliation":["University of Maryland Baltimore County, Catonsville, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Anindya","lastName":"Roy","id":"37675796900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"5313943","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":145,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2407},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Character generation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Gaussian distribution","Shape","Power system modeling","Covariance matrix","Random variables","Radar signal processing","Independent component analysis","Laplace equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian distribution","maximum likelihood estimation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex-valued generalized Gaussian distribution","data modeling","probability density function","maximum likelihood estimation procedure","shape parameters","covariance parameters","radar data","complex-valued signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Complex-valued signal processing","generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD)","maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)"]}],"abstract":"The generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) provides a flexible and suitable tool for data modeling and simulation, however the characterization of the complex-valued GGD, in particular generation of samples from a complex GGD have not been well defined in the literature.

First, assuming that full channel state information (CSI) of the two hop channels is available, a suboptimal dual hop joint precoding scheme, i.e., precoding at both the base station and relay station, is investigated. Based on its structure, a scheme of limited feedback joint precoding using joint codebooks is then proposed, which uses a distributed codeword selection to concurrently choose two joint precoders such that the feedback delay is considerably decreased. Finally, the joint codebook design for the limited feedback joint precoding system is analyzed, and results reveal that independent codebook designs at the base station and relay station using the conventional Grassmannian subspace packing method is able to guarantee that the overall performance of the dual hop joint precoding scheme improves with the size of each of the two codebooks. Simulation results show that the proposed dual hop joint precoding system using distributed codeword selection scheme exhibits a rate or BER performance close to the one using the optimal centralized codeword selection scheme, while having lower computational complexity and shorter feedback delay.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2036061","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05313945.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2036061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Limited Feedback Joint Precoding for Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313945","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Limited Feedback Joint Precoding for Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313945/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105871","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5313945/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Limited Feedback Joint Precoding for Amplify-and-Forward Relaying","sourcePdf":"tsp-huang-2036061.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130966S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5313945","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5313946,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Choqueuse","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Brest, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410627/5313946/5313946-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vincent Choqueuse (M'08) was born in 1981 in Brest, France.

Numerous studies about carrier frequency estimation, modulation recognition as well as channel identification are available in literature. This paper deals with the blind recognition of the space-time block coding (STBC) scheme used in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. Assuming there is perfect synchronization at the receiver side, this paper proposes three maximum-likelihood (ML)-based approaches for STBC classification: the optimal classifier, the second-order statistic (SOS) classifier, and the code parameter (CP) classifier. While the optimal and the SOS approaches require ideal conditions, the CP classifier is well suited for the blind context where the communication parameters are unknown at the receiver side. Our simulations show that this blind classifier is more easily implemented and yields better performance than those available in literature.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","accessionNumber":"11105867","htmlLink":"/document/5313946/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Blind Recognition of Linear Space\u2013Time Block Codes: A Likelihood-Based Approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Recognition of Linear Space\u2013Time Block Codes: A Likelihood-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"tsp-choqueuse-2036062.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11184S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5313946","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5313947,"authors":[{"name":"Roni Mittelman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410627/5313947/5313947-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Roni Mittelman (S\u201908\u2013M\u201909) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc.

In this work we present a new criterion for the minimax estimation problem which we call the generalized difference regret (GDR), and derive a new minimax estimator which is based on the GDR criterion where the region of uncertainty is defined not only using upper and lower bounds on the eigenvalues of the parameter's covariance matrix, but also using upper and lower bounds on the individual elements of the covariance matrix itself. Furthermore, the new estimator does not require the assumption of joint diagonalizability and it can be obtained efficiently using semidefinite programming. We also show that when the joint diagonalizability assumption holds and when there are only eigenvalue uncertainties, then the new estimator is identical to the difference regret estimator. The experimental results show that we can obtain improved mean squared error (MSE) results compared to the MMSE, DR, and RR estimators.","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5410627/05313947.pdf","startPage":"1001","endPage":"1011","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5410627","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2036063","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2036063","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313947","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Uncertainty","Covariance matrix","Minimax techniques","Gaussian noise","Additive noise","Noise robustness","Vectors","Closed-form solution","Estimation error"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","covariance matrices","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","estimation theory","mean square error methods","minimax techniques","random processes","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust estimation","random parameter","Gaussian linear model","eigenvalue","covariance uncertainty","Gaussian random vector","linear transformation","additive Gaussian noise","covariance matrix","minimax estimation","ratio regret","generalized difference regret","GDR criterion","semidefinite programming","mean squared error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Covariance uncertainty","linear estimation","minimax estimators","minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimation","regret","robust estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313947/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Robust Estimation of a Random Parameter in a Gaussian Linear Model With Joint Eigenvalue and Elementwise Covariance Uncertainties","accessionNumber":"11138099","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2010","publicationDate":"March 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5313947/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"58","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Estimation of a Random Parameter in a Gaussian Linear Model With Joint Eigenvalue and Elementwise Covariance Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"tsp-mittelman-2036063.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13314S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410627","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5410627","articleId":"5313947","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5313948,"authors":[{"name":"Ilker Bayram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, NY, USA","Biomedical Imaging Group, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5410627/5313948/5313948-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["\u0130lker Bayram received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical and electronics engineering from Middle East Technical University (METU), Ankara, Turkey, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Polytechnic Institute of New York University, Brooklyn, in 2002, 2004, and 2009, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Biomedical Imaging Group, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne (EPFL).

This approach is based on a linear combination of ratios of certain even-order moments, which allow the derivation of NDA SNR estimators without requiring memory-costly lookup tables. The weights of the linear combination can be tuned according to the constellation and the SNR operation range. As particular case we develop an eighth-order statistics (EOS)-based estimator, showing in detail the statistical analysis that leads to the weight optimization procedure. The EOS-based estimators yield improved performance for multilevel constellations, especially for those with two and three amplitude levels.

The focus is on two aspects of the estimator: robustness against outliers as measured by the influence function (IF) and on its asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) as measured by the ratio of the asymptotic variance of the FastICA w.r.t. the optimal maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). The derived compact closed-form expression of the IF reveals the vulnerability of the FastICA estimator to outliers regardless of the used nonlinearity. A cautionary finding is that even a moderate observation towards certain directions can render the estimator deficient in the sense that its separation performance degrades worse than a plain guess. The IF allows the derivation of a compact closed-form expression for the asymptotic covariance matrix of the FastICA estimator and subsequently its asymptotic relative efficiencies (AREs). The ARE figures calculated for some selected source distributions illustrate the fact that the order which the ICs are found is crucial as the accuracy of the previously extracted components can dominantly affect the accuracy of the successive deflation stages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313959/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","volume":"58","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"11105849","publicationDate":"March 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5313959/","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Deflation-Based FastICA Estimator: Statistical Analysis Revisited","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Deflation-Based FastICA Estimator: Statistical Analysis Revisited","sourcePdf":"tsp-ollila-2036072.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104862S","chronDate":"March  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5410625","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5410625","articleId":"5313959","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5313961,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boulanger","affiliation":["UMR-144 Institut Curie/CNRS, Cell and Tissue Image Facility PICT-IBISA Paris, France","Radon Institute of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"J\u00e9r\u00f4me","lastName":"Boulanger","id":"37298603300"},{"name":"Charles Kervrann","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France","INRA, MIA Jouy-and-Josas, France"],"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Kervrann","id":"37294238500"},{"name":"Patrick Bouthemy","affiliation":["INRIA Rennes Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Bouthemy","id":"37266133400"},{"name":"Peter Elbau","affiliation":["Radon Institute of Computational and Applied Mathematics, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Elbau","id":"37681512300"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Sibarita","affiliation":["UMR 5091, CNRS Institut Fran\u00e7ois Magendie Bordeaux, Universit\u00e9 Bordeaux 2, France","UMR-144 Institut Curie/CNRS, Cell and Tissue Image Facility PICT-IBISA Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Sibarita","id":"37327262400"},{"name":"Jean Salamero","affiliation":["UMR 144 CNRS Institut Curie, Molecular Mechanisms of Intracellular Transport, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Salamero","id":"37681513100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0062"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-254X"}],"articleNumber":"5313961","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":187,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2438},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control Society","url":"http://www.ieee-uffc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Fluorescence","Microscopy","Image sequences","Signal to noise ratio","Protein engineering","Mathematics","Deconvolution","Additive noise","Motion estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fluorescence","Gaussian noise","image denoising","image sequences","medical image processing","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["patch based nonlocal functional","3D image denoising","fluorescence video microscopy","image sequences","nonparametric regression method","Poisson-Gaussian noise","space-time discontinuities","pointwise estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive estimation","energy minimization","fluorescence","image sequence denoising","patch-based approach","Poisson noise","variance stabilization","video-microscopy"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","HeLa Cells","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Microscopy, Fluorescence","Microscopy, Video","Normal Distribution","Poisson Distribution"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5313961","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2009.2033991","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","abstract":"We present a nonparametric regression method for denoising 3-D image sequences acquired via fluorescence microscopy. The proposed method exploits the redundancy of the 3-D+time information to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of images corrupted by Poisson-Gaussian noise. A variance stabilization transform is first applied to the image-data to remove the dependence between the mean and variance of intensity values. This preprocessing requires the knowledge of parameters related to the acquisition system, also estimated in our approach. In a second step, we propose an original statistical patch-based framework for noise reduction and preservation of space-time discontinuities. In our study, discontinuities are related to small moving spots with high velocity observed in fluorescence video-microscopy. The idea is to minimize an objective nonlocal energy functional involving spatio-temporal image patches. The minimizer has a simple form and is defined as the weighted average of input data taken in spatially-varying neighborhoods. The size of each neighborhood is optimized to improve the performance of the pointwise estimator. The performance of the algorithm (which requires no motion estimation) is then evaluated on both synthetic and real image sequences using qualitative and quantitative criteria.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2009.2033991","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5405633","startPage":"442","endPage":"454","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5405633/05313961.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Patch-Based Nonlocal Functional for Denoising Fluorescence Microscopy Image Sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5313961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"06 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5313961/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Patch-Based Nonlocal Functional for Denoising Fluorescence Microscopy Image Sequences","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11118438","pubMedId":"19900849","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Patch-Based Nonlocal Functional for Denoising Fluorescence Microscopy Image Sequences","sourcePdf":"tmi-boulanger-2033991.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122476S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5405633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"187","xplore-issue":"5405633","articleId":"5313961","onlineDate":"06 November 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5313991,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Field Programmable Gate Array technology (FPGA) is a highly configurable option for implementing many sophisticated signal processing tasks in SDR. In this paper, a generic, configurable and low power Viterbi decoder for software defined radio is described using a VHDL code for FPGA implementation. The proposed design of the Viterbi decoder is considered to be generic so that it facilitates the prototyping of the decoder with different specifications.

In this field, switching losses are an important efficiency issue due to long term operation costs. Previous works have centered the analysis in comparing different topologies or semiconductors in relation to switching losses. However, switching loses are closely related to the modulation method employed to control the converter. Therefore, the comparison of several modulation methods applied to a single topology can provide valuable insight for designing considerations. This paper presents a switching loss estimation method for Neutral Point Clamped (NPC) multilevel converters. The estimation method is based on experimental measurements of the power semiconductors together with a linearized switching model of the converter. In addition manufacturer datasheet information is used to represent more accurately different operating conditions. The estimation method is used to compare the switching losses produced by the most common modulation methods used for NPC converters. The main purpose of the paper is to provide quantitative results to compare the different modulation methods in terms of efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316040/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5316040/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10965387","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Switching loss analysis of modulation methods used in neutral point clamped converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching loss analysis of modulation methods used in neutral point clamped converters","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049726S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316040","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5316041,"authors":[{"name":"Samir Kouro","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Kouro","id":"37270051000"},{"name":"Bruno La Rocca","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Bruno","lastName":"La Rocca","id":"37643912800"},{"name":"Patricio Cortes","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Patricio","lastName":"Cortes","id":"37275248400"},{"name":"Salvador Alepuz","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Salvador","lastName":"Alepuz","id":"37275467500"},{"name":"Bin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37275265600"},{"name":"Jose Rodriguez","affiliation":["Electronics Engineering Department, Universidad T\u00e8cnica Federico Santa Mar\u00eda, Valparaiso, Chile"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37279149900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316041","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":54,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1469},"abstract":"This paper presents a new low switching frequency modulation technique for multilevel power converters. The proposed algorithm is based on model predictive control and uses the sliding discrete Fourier transform to calculate harmonic components in real time in order to eliminate undesired harmonics at the output voltage. In this way the cost function of the predictive control can achieve similar results to traditional selective harmonic elimination, but without the need of off-line calculations and interpolation tables. The algorithm is executed online in real time, improving the dynamic performance of the system. In addition, no predefined switching patterns need to be designed, making the generalization for multilevel converters an easy task even for any modulation index or converters with different number of levels. Simulations results for three and seven level inverters are presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive control","Switching frequency","Switching converters","Frequency modulation","Predictive models","Discrete Fourier transforms","Cost function","Interpolation","Real time systems","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","interpolation","power convertors","predictive control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["predictive control","selective harmonic elimination","multilevel power converters","low switching frequency modulation technique","sliding discrete Fourier transform","interpolation tables","off-line calculations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Predictive control","selective harmonic elimination","multilevel converters"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316041","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316041.pdf","startPage":"3130","endPage":"3136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive control based selective harmonic elimination with low switching frequency for multilevel converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Predictive control based selective harmonic elimination with low switching frequency for multilevel converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316041/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316041/","accessionNumber":"10965388","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive control based selective harmonic elimination with low switching frequency for multilevel converters","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071594S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5316054,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Du","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Du","id":"37535857400"},{"name":"Pinjia Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Pinjia","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37400524600"},{"name":"Zhi Gao","affiliation":["Schneider Electric Center for Innovation and Technology, Knightdale, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37557304500"},{"name":"Thomas G.

The x-dim components are double sided SMT passives, having uniform height (x) and enhanced thermal properties. With stacked converter construction and the x-dim components soldered to two sides, the heat removal from the systems can be significantly improved. This publication presents various methods to manufacture thermally enhanced x-dim components. The thermal behaviour of x-dim components is improved by integrating heat extractors, removing packaging materials and filling the air gaps by potting compounds. In the stacked construction, thermal enhancement of one component improves heat removal from other components, placed in adjacent stack layers. Thermal performance of x-dim components in both standard and stacked converter constructions is evaluated by FEM and analytical simulations. New x-dim components employed in stacked construction play a key role in overcoming current power density limits.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316055","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316055.pdf","startPage":"1017","endPage":"1024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermally enhanced SMT power components","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Thermally enhanced SMT power components","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316055/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10965396","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermally enhanced SMT power components","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2181.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040251S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5316057,"authors":[{"name":"Jeong-Gyu Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Gyeongnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Gyu","lastName":"Lim","id":"37594783200"},{"name":"Se-Kyo Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju, Gyeongnam, South Korea"],"firstName":"Se-Kyo","lastName":"Chung","id":"37278470000"},{"name":"Yujin Song","affiliation":["Korea Institute of Energy and Research, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yujin","lastName":"Song","id":"37600651400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316057","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":591},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital control","Pulse width modulation converters","Pulse width modulation","Field programmable gate arrays","Voltage control","Control systems","Signal resolution","Pulse generation","Switching frequency","Switching converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","digital control","discrete time systems","electric current control","field programmable gate arrays","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based digital current mode controller","phase-shifted full-bridge PWM converter","field programmable gate arrays","digital PWM generator","switching frequency","average current mode controller","DC-DC power conversion","discrete-time domain model","frequency 195 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC power conversion","Digital control","Field programmable gate arrays","Pulse width modulated power converters","Digital integrated circuits"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with a digital current mode controller for a phase-shifted full-bridge PWM converter (PSFBC) using a field programmable gate arrays (FPGA).

The proposed analytical approach is unified, covering both hard and soft switched SCC topologies. The major advantage of the proposed model is that it expresses the losses as a function of the currents passing through each flying capacitor. Since these currents are linearly proportional to the output current, the model is also applicable to SCC with multiple capacitors. The proposed model provides an insight into the expected losses in SCC and the effects of their operational conditions such as duty cycle. As such, the model can help in the optimization of SCC systems and their control to achieve desired regulations.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","startPage":"3501","endPage":"3508","displayPublicationTitle":"2009

However, requirements such as high power factor, long lifetime, accurate current control and high efficiency pose challenges to the design of LED ballast circuits. This paper proposes an LED ballast with a first-stage isolated current-fed power factor correction (PFC) pre-regulator that puts the storage capacitor to the secondary, thus allowing the use of lower-voltage storage capacitor in order to extend the overall system lifetime. Furthermore, the high voltage stress on the main switch, which is typical in current-fed converters, is reduced substantially by appropriately exploiting the transformer leakage inductance. The design uses two secondary transformer windings and an LED current driver to form a non-cascading structure to improve efficiency. Multiple non-cascading structures can be used for LED lamps for instant independent brightness control. Analysis, design example and prototype verification are given for the LED ballast.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electronic ballasts","LED lamps","Light emitting diodes","Capacitors","Switches","Light sources","Reactive power","Current control","Circuits","Power factor correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lamp accessories","LED lamps","lighting control","power convertors","power factor correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["independent control","multiple LED lamps","light-emitting-diode light sources","LED ballast circuit design","current-fed power factor correction","storage capacitor","voltage stress","current-fed converters","transformer leakage inductance","brightness control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LED lighting","isolated PFC regulator","LED ballast","non-cascading construction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316071","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316071.pdf","startPage":"2821","endPage":"2826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ballast for independent control of multiple LED lamps","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ballast for independent control of multiple LED lamps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316071/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316071/","accessionNumber":"10965412","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ballast for independent control of multiple LED lamps","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1436.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053098S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5316075,"authors":[{"name":"Rolando Burgos","affiliation":["Center of Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Rolando","lastName":"Burgos","id":"37270043300"},{"name":"Zheng Chen","affiliation":["Center of Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Chen","id":"37404314800"},{"name":"Dushan Boroyevich","affiliation":["Center of Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Dushan","lastName":"Boroyevich","id":"37274991300"},{"name":"Fred Wang","affiliation":["Center of Power Electronics Systems (CPES), Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Wang","id":"37277654900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316075","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1166},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon carbide","JFET circuits","Switching circuits","Temperature distribution","Breakdown voltage","Frequency measurement","Power electronics","Electric resistance","Schottky barriers","Schottky diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver circuits","junction gate field effect transistors","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gate-drive circuit","JFET","phase-leg configuration","inductive load","junction temperatures","time 12 ns to 55 ns","voltage 600 V","current 10 A","temperature 25 degC to 200 degC","SiC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["JFET","gate-drive circuit","Silicon-Carbide (SiC)","phase-leg","Schottky barrier diode (SBD)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents detailed design considerations of an ultra fast gate-drive circuit for 1.2 kV SiC JFET devices in phase-leg configuration using 0-Omega gate resistance.

The ZCS-MMSCC does not utilize any additional components to achieve ZCS and solves the current and voltage spike problem during the switching transition, thus leading to reliable and high efficiency advantages over traditional MMSCC.

Since custom solutions are expensive, machines with dual three-phase windings supplied by two parallel converters seem to be more convenient. In the event of fault, one of the two three-phase windings (the faulty winding) is disconnected and the motor is operated by means of the healthy winding only. A fractional-slot permanent magnet motor with 12-slot and 10-pole is considered with two different rotor topologies : the interior permanent magnet (IPM) rotor and the surface mounted permanent magnet (SPM) rotor. Various winding configurations of dual three-phase windings are taken into account, comparing average torque, torque ripple, mutual coupling among phases, overload capability and short-circuit behavior. Considerations are given regarding the winding arrangements so as to avoid excessive torque ripple and unbalanced radial forces in faulty operating conditions.

The switching performance of the device, on the other hand, has also been tested under room temperature using a specially designed double-pulse tester with minimized circuit parasitics.

A photovoltaic AC module (PVAC) integrated the inverter directly with the PV module which exposes the power electronic circuitry to the thermal environment of the PV module. This has been reported to impose additional requirements on component selection and circuit design. However, a worst-case stack up analysis can lead to the conclusion that module-integrated inverters require industrial grade components or expensive thermal management. This paper presents a detailed thermal model for the PV module that uses real-world operating conditions, based on observed data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to calculate PV module temperature. Results from the model confirm that the peak PV module temperature can reach over 80degC, which was expected from other techniques, but that these peak temperatures occur on average for only 8 minutes per year in locations similar to Tucson, Az. Since the PV module temperature is found to be less than 70degC for 99% of the operation hours, thermal management is not onerous and that the use of lower cost, commercial grade components will provide a mean time between failure (MTBF) to support an inverter warranty equivalent to that of the PV module itself.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316107","startPage":"3343","endPage":"3349","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316107","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316107.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A photovoltaic module thermal model using observed insolation and meteorological data to support a long life, highly reliable module-integrated inverter design by predicting expected operating temperature","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316107/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A photovoltaic module thermal model using observed insolation and meteorological data to support a long life, highly reliable module-integrated inverter design by predicting expected operating temperature","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316107/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10965447","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A photovoltaic module thermal model using observed insolation and meteorological data to support a long life, highly reliable module-integrated inverter design by predicting expected operating temperature","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2128.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054624S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5316111,"authors":[{"name":"Majd G.

A transistor model valid at VHF switching frequencies is developed. Device parameters are related to layout geometry and the resulting layout vs. loss tradeoffs are illustrated. A method of finding an optimal layout for a given converter application is developed and experimentally verified in a 50 MHz converter, resulting in a 35% reduction in power loss over an un-optimized device. It is further demonstrated that hot-carrier limits on device safe operating area may be relaxed under soft switching, yielding significant further loss reduction. A device fabricated with 20-V design rules is validated at 35-V, offering reduced parasitic resistance and capacitance. Compared to the original design, loss is up to 75% lower in the example application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316121/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5316121/","accessionNumber":"10965461","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of transistors for very high frequency dc-dc converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of transistors for very high frequency dc-dc converters","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062133S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5316124,"authors":[{"name":"Yujin Song","affiliation":["Korea Institute of Energy and Research, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yujin","lastName":"Song","id":"37600651400"},{"name":"S.

The input ripple current is minimized by three phases interleave operation, and the transformer turn ratio is reduced by its inherent boost mode operation effectively.

In a dq reference frame, ac (time varying) quantities appear as dc (time invariant) quantities allowing the controller to be designed as for dc-dc converters presenting infinite control gain at the steady-state operating point to achieve zero steady state error. The common approach is to create a set of imaginary quantities orthogonal to those of the real single-phase system so as to obtain dc quantities by means of a stationary to rotating frame transformation. The orthogonal imaginary quantities in common approaches are obtained by phase shifting the real components by a quarter of the fundamental period. The introduction of such delay in the system deteriorates the dynamic response, which becomes slower and oscillatory. In the proposed approach of this paper, the orthogonal quantities are generated by an imaginary system called Fictive Axis, which runs concurrently with the real one. The proposed approach, which is referred to as Fictive Axis Emulation (FAE), effectively improves the poor dynamics of the conventional approaches while does not add excessive complexity to the controller structure.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316133","startPage":"2689","endPage":"2695","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316133.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector control of single-phase voltage source converters based on Fictive Axis Emulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316133/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Vector control of single-phase voltage source converters based on Fictive Axis Emulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316133/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10965473","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector control of single-phase voltage source converters based on Fictive Axis Emulation","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069481S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316133","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5316135,"authors":[{"name":"Hyun-Wook Seong","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-Wook","lastName":"Seong","id":"37605187700"},{"name":"Ki-Bum Park","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Ki-Bum","lastName":"Park","id":"37281166500"},{"name":"Gun-Woo Moon","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gun-Woo","lastName":"Moon","id":"37277729800"},{"name":"Myung-Joong Youn","affiliation":["Division of Electrical Engineering, School of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Myung-Joong","lastName":"Youn","id":"37270756500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316135","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":461},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Zero voltage switching","DC-DC power converters","Switching converters","Switches","Topology","Inductors","Turning","Switching loss","Switching circuits","Switched capacitor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-voltage switching dual inductor-fed DC-DC converter","high power step-up applications","parallel bidirectional boost converter","current-fed type boost topologies","high voltage spike","switching losses","voltage 42 V","voltage 400 V","current 1 A","frequency 50 kHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC converter","Zero-Voltage Switching (ZVS)","Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM)","Dual Inductor-fed Boost Converter (DIFBC)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Zero-voltage switching dual inductor-fed DC-DC converter for high power step-up applications","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316135","startPage":"699","endPage":"706","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316135.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316135","abstract":"This paper presents zero-voltage switching (ZVS) dual inductor-fed DC-DC converter integrating a conventional dual inductor-fed boost converter (DIFBC) and a parallel bidirectional boost converter.

The results will provide useful information for both the drive system designer and the machine designer at an early stage of the design process.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316144","startPage":"187","endPage":"193","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316144.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A useful multi-objective optimization design method for PM motors considering nonlinear material properties","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316144/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A useful multi-objective optimization design method for PM motors considering nonlinear material properties","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316144/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10965484","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A useful multi-objective optimization design method for PM motors considering nonlinear material properties","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2007.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11666S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5316146,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Xing","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Xing","id":"37400654900"},{"name":"Frank Feng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Feng","id":"37594769300"},{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["United Technology-Hamilton Sundstrand, Rockford, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Sun","id":"37281412000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316146","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":439},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Electromagnetic interference","Filters","Impedance","Stability","Switching converters","Shock absorbers","Circuits","Analytical models","Power dissipation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","electromagnetic interference","filters","inductors","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["EMI","input filter damping","switching power converter","damper circuits","damping effects","power dissipation","damping capacitors","damping inductors"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316146","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316146.pdf","startPage":"1685","endPage":"1692","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal damping of EMI filter input impedance","abstract":"Input filter damping has long been recognized as critical for avoiding unintended interactions with a switching power converter.

When no direct voltage measurement is available and the reference voltages are used instead, the problem relies in the non-linear error that affects the motor back-EMF estimation. The back-EMF signals are fundamental for estimating the motor flux in most of SFOC schemes, either oriented on the stator flux or on the rotor flux. Many methods have been proposed for compensating such non-linearities (IGBT dead-time and on-state voltage drops) by means of the digital control algorithm. In many references the compensation relies on an inverter model based on the signum function of the motor phase currents. In the considered cases, the identification of the compensation parameters is performed off-line, often with additional processing tasks. Very few schemes are integrated into the control code of the IM drive. The goal of the paper is to present a model of the inverter non-linear effects that is more accurate than the signum-based one, and the related self-identification method. The proposed inverter model can be identified directly by the digital controller at the drive start-up with no extra measures other than the motor phase currents and dc-link voltage. After the commissioning session, the compensation does not require to be tuned furthermore and is robust against temperature detuning. The identification is based on the feedback signal of the closed-loop flux observer in dc current conditions. The experimental results, presented here for a rotor flux oriented SFOC IM drive for home appliances, demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316149/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5316149/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10965489","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Accurate inverter error compensation and related self-commissioning scheme in sensorless induction motor drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate inverter error compensation and related self-commissioning scheme in sensorless induction motor drives","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"2029.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055295S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316149","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5316150,"authors":[{"name":"E.

A simplified mathematical model of the LED was used to characterize the self-oscillating converter for driving the power LEDs. With the proposed converter the LEDs manufacturing tolerances and drifts over temperature presents little to no influence over the LED average current.

These motors can realize magnetic suspension of rotor shafts without mechanical contacts. Recently, non-contact canned motor pumps without expendable parts by means of using these motors have been vigorously developed. In these pumps, the large magnetic gap length of about 5 mm or more is required of the bearingless motors, because fluid flows into the gap. It becomes difficult to generate sufficient suspension force for magnetic suspension, as the magnetic gap length is increased. Therefore, a novel structure of a 5-axis active control type bearingless motor which can generate the sufficient suspension force under wide-gap condition has been proposed by the principal authors. In general, thrust disks with large outside diameters are used in thrust magnetic bearings. However, in the canned motor pump application, rotational speed is limited to prevent cavitation caused by the large thrust disks.

This paper presents the analysis of the 5-level ANPC converter with an optimum PWM strategy to achieve the minimized total harmonic distortion (THD) for high power or high frequency applications. Instead of relying on the conventional look-up table based on off-line calculated solutions, the switching angles of the optimum PWM are calculated through a real-time algorithm, which is time-efficient and therefore easy to implement in real-time by digital processors. The control scheme of balancing the floating capacitors voltages is also proposed. Simulation results verify the performance of the proposed strategies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316229/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10965088","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316229/","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An optimum PWM Strategy for 5-level active NPC (ANPC) converter based on real-time solution for THD minimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimum PWM Strategy for 5-level active NPC (ANPC) converter based on real-time solution for THD minimization","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1839.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052664S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5316232,"authors":[{"name":"Ryosuke Miyahara","affiliation":["Department of Information and Image Science, Chiba University, Inage, Chiba, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryosuke","lastName":"Miyahara","id":"37580059800"},{"name":"Hiroo Sekiya","affiliation":["Department of Information and Image Science, Chiba University, Inage, Chiba, Japan","Department of Electrical Engineering, Wright State University, Dayton, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Hiroo","lastName":"Sekiya","id":"37266935800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316232","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","Frequency","Power amplifiers","Feedback circuits","Output feedback","Zero voltage switching","Laboratories","Operational amplifiers","Power conversion","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback amplifiers","frequency multipliers","HF amplifiers","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["class-EM power amplifier design","feedback voltage","ZVS class-E frequency doubler","auxiliary circuit","power conversion efficiency","power 13.3 W","frequency 3.5 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Class-E amplifier","Class-EM amplifier","Feedback network","High frequency operation","Jumpless current","Switching time"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316232","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316232","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316232.pdf","startPage":"3859","endPage":"3864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of class-E<inf>M</inf> power amplifier with one input signal","abstract":"This paper presents a class-E\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">M</sub>\n amplifier with one input signal, along with its design procedure and experimental results.

This phenomenon is called source subsystem interaction. As an active approach to improve the stability degraded by the source subsystem interaction, the positive feedforward (PFF) control is proposed for the peak-current-mode-controlled buck converter. PFF control stabilizes the input port in the frequency range where the source subsystem interaction affects system stability, while allowing the feedback controller to maintain tight output voltage regulation at lower frequencies. The approach results in greatly improved stability with a slight reduction of output feedback control bandwidth. Small-signal models are developed based on g-parameter representation. The design technique of the positive feedforward controller is discussed. Also, the total system stability is analyzed based on the unified impedance criterion. This approach is validated by simulation.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316267","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316267.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","startPage":"2928","endPage":"2935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Peak-current-mode-controlled buck converter with positive feedforward control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Peak-current-mode-controlled buck converter with positive feedforward control","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316267/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10965184","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5316267/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Peak-current-mode-controlled buck converter with positive feedforward control","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1761.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057754S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5316273,"authors":[{"name":"Aiguo Xu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Aiguo Xu","id":"37576377800"},{"name":"Shaojun Xie","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Shaojun","lastName":"Xie","id":"37278013400"},{"name":"Yuan Yao","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Yuan Yao","id":"37672200300"},{"name":"Xiaobao Liu","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Xiaobao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37578832400"},{"name":"Huafeng Xiao","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Huafeng","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37287668900"},{"name":"Jingjing Feng","affiliation":["Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Jingjing","lastName":"Feng","id":"37670479500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316273","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":488},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316273","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy storage","Rails","Equalizers","Power conversion","Circuits","Voltage control","Control systems","Bidirectional control","Power system reliability","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy storage","power conversion","railway electrification","supercapacitors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultracapacitor","energy storage system","urban rail transit","energy waste","modular power conversation scheme","electric supply system","high supply voltage","multiphase power conversion circuit","dual loop control system","bi-directional energy flow","input voltage equalization","voltage equalizer scheme","power conversion strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy storage","Rail transportation electrical systems","DC-DC power conversion","Equalizers"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316273","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316273.pdf","startPage":"1626","endPage":"1631","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An ultra-capacitor based regenerating energy storage system for urban rail transit","abstract":"This paper presents an energy storage system based on ultra-capacitor to absorbing the regenerating energy of urban rail transit and releasing the energy when the train starts, which can cut down the energy waste.

To realize these goals, Oil and Gas utilities are looking for electrical solutions as prime movers on their compressor trains. These solutions make use of large scale Variable Speed Drive (VSD) system such as voltage source inverter (VSI) with high power AC motor drive systems. Since large electrical drive systems are a relatively new technology with limited field data, the full load test of 30 MVA 5-level VSI system was carried out on a test stand to measure critical data necessary to evaluate system performances.

Determining the location and amount of distributed compensation to be employed is an important problem. Proper deployment of DFACTS is necessary for optimal control of the power flow in a large meshed network. Being a distributed solution, DFACTS provides flexibility in terms of deployment. This often makes the problem even more computationally intensive. Recent studies show that Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique gives better results than classical optimization techniques, when applied to power engineering optimization problems. This paper shows the application of PSO for the optimal deployment of DFACTS. The technique is applied on the IEEE 39 bus system.

This paper presents a power supply for Envelope Tracking applications based on a multilevel topology: it targets relatively low voltage systems (12-28 volt range) and medium to high power applications (> 50 W peak power). It uses several input voltages to generate a multilevel square waveform which can be easily filtered; it achieves low output voltage ripple, high tracking bandwidths, high efficiency and high output power capabilities. This paper first analyzes its steady-state behaviour; then, a design procedure is provided, along with guidelines for appropriate implementation of the proposed system. A three-level prototype was built to test the system, and its performance is shown in the experimental results section.

All of them try to reduce power loss by minimizing the number of magnetic components. Generally, converter topologies which have no output-inductor for DC/DC converter has no loss of it.

Active clamp flyback converter and output-inductor-less forward converter are representative converters without output inductor. However, these converters have critical problems. In active clamp flyback converter, DC offset current which degrades transformer utilization and makes transformer bulky. Therefore it causes low power density. In the other side, output-inductor-less active clamp forward converter has high RMS value of current which causes heat problem and low efficiency. This paper proposes a current boosted active clamp forward converter without output filter. Due to applying the proposed current boost-up circuit, the proposed converter has low conduction loss and low voltage ringing of the secondary rectifier.

The proposed dimming controller uses the phase angle of the dimmer as the input feedforward parameter and controls the switch of the power circuit using duty ratio control at the same time.

This paper shows that the variable frequency drive incorporated in a rotating shaft is one of the main root causes of mechanical shaft failures. Simple analytical relationships show that the frequencies of the motor airgap torque have a more significant impact on the mechanical shaft failure than their magnitudes. Effects of mechanical damping are analytically derived and analyzed. Motor airgap torque is successfully reconstructed using only the motor's voltage and current, thus avoiding torque sensors, which are subject to failure and errors. Simple relationships between frequencies of current harmonics and frequencies of motor pulsating torques are proposed. For pulse width modulated inverters (two and multi-level), possible drive operating points that might excite the shaft's eigenmodes are predicted. Simulation results of four interleaved three-level neutralpoint-clamped converters are analyzed for validation purposes. Experimental tests up to 35 MW are performed on a compressor test bed. The presented results confirm the accuracy of the proposed approach, which is particularly valuable for multimegawatt drive applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Shafts","Frequency","Torque","Pulse width modulation inverters","Testing","Failure analysis","Damping","Voltage","Mechanical sensors","Pulse inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shafts","variable speed drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mechanical shaft failures","pulsating torques","variable frequency drives","motor airgap torque","mechanical damping","motor voltage","motor current","shafts eigenmodes","multimegawatt drive applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pulsating Torque","Torque Harmonics","Torsional Vibration","Mechanical resonance","Medium-voltage","Multi-level inverter","PWM","Oil and Gas","LNG","Mining","Cement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316433","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316433.pdf","startPage":"3469","endPage":"3476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316433","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of mechanical shaft failures due to pulsating torques of variable frequency drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Prediction of mechanical shaft failures due to pulsating torques of variable frequency drives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316433/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316433/","accessionNumber":"10965179","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of mechanical shaft failures due to pulsating torques of variable frequency drives","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1319.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120656S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5316449,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Ma","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Lin Ma","id":"37597181400"},{"name":"Xinmin Jin","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"lastName":"Xinmin Jin","id":"37591848900"},{"name":"Tamas Kerekes","affiliation":["University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Tamas","lastName":"Kerekes","id":"37301154000"},{"name":"Marco Liserre","affiliation":["Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Liserre","id":"37272424200"},{"name":"Remus Teodorescu","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettrotecnica ed,Elettronica, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Remus","lastName":"Teodorescu","id":"37276254200"},{"name":"Pedro Rodriguez","affiliation":["IEEE Department of Electrical Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Pedro","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37274433700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316449","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Distributed control","Topology","Pulse width modulation","Photovoltaic systems","Leakage current","Semiconductor devices","Lead compounds","Temperature distribution","Solar power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","losses","photovoltaic power systems","PWM invertors","temperature distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM strategies","grid-connected distributed generation","active NPC inverters","neutral point clamped topology","low leakage current","EMI","unequal losses distribution","semiconductor devices","power losses distribution problem","modulation strategy","adjustable losses distribution PWM strategy","PLECS toolbox","photovoltaic systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multilevel systems","Photovoltaic power systems","Pulse modulation","Topology"]}],"abstract":"The neutral point clamped topology due to high efficiency, low leakage current and EMI, its integration is widely used in the distributed generation (DG) systems. However the main disadvantage of the NPC inverter is given by an unequal distribution of the losses in the semiconductor devices, which leads to an unequal distribution of temperature. By using the active NPC topology, the power losses distribution problem is alleviated. The modulation strategy is a key issue for losses distribution in this topology. In this paper two known strategies are discussed and a new proposed PWM strategy, namely the adjustable losses distribution (ALD) PWM strategy is proposed for better losses distribution in the active NPC (ANPC) topology.

Training data for the neural network is generated by conducting a series of experiments on a shaded solar panel at different hours of a day for several days. After training the neural network, its accuracy and generalization properties are verified on test data. It is found that the neural network, which is an approximation of the actual shading function, is able to estimate the maximum possible output power of the solar PV arrays accurately. Further, the network is able to estimate the maximum output power for field data and gives rise to the possibility that the proposed approach can be used for making decision regarding the installation of solar PV arrays in the field.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316451","startPage":"3357","endPage":"3362","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316451.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of solar photovoltaic arrays including shadow effects using neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316451/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of solar photovoltaic arrays including shadow effects using neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316451/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10965252","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of solar photovoltaic arrays including shadow effects using neural network","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046323S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":5316460,"authors":[{"name":"Gierri Waltrich","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Gierri","lastName":"Waltrich","id":"37402787100"},{"name":"Ivo Barbi","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics, Federal University of Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil"],"firstName":"Ivo","lastName":"Barbi","id":"37274409800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316460","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":576},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Leg","Voltage","Pulse width modulation inverters","Switches","Topology","Tin","Frequency modulation","Power electronics","Pulse width modulation","Phase modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric machines","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-phase cascaded multilevel inverter","power cells","electrical machines","PWM phase-shifted multicarrier modulation","power 15 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Inverters","cascade systems","multilevel systems","PWM"]}],"abstract":"In this paper the study of a modular three-phase multilevel inverter for application in electrical machines is proposed.

Since PM demagnetization results in degradation of motor performance, efficiency, and reliability, it is important to monitor the quality of PMs regularly. However, there are many limitations to the off-line and on-line methods currently used for magnet quality assessment. In this paper, a new inverter-embedded technique for automated monitoring of magnet quality for permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) that overcomes the limitations of existing techniques is proposed. The main concept is to use the inverter to perform a standstill test whenever the motor is stopped to detect local or uniform PM demagnetization. The machine is excited with a pulsating field at different angular positions, and the change in the current peaks caused by the change in the degree of magnetic saturation due to demagnetization is observed. An experimental study on a 10 hp PMSM verifies that local and uniform PM demagnetization can be detected with high sensitivity.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316464","startPage":"2326","endPage":"2333","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316464.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated monitoring of magnet quality for permanent magnet synchronous motors at standstill","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316464/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automated monitoring of magnet quality for permanent magnet synchronous motors at standstill","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316464/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10965265","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated monitoring of magnet quality for permanent magnet synchronous motors at standstill","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067936S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5316470,"authors":[{"name":"Kui Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37595292500"},{"name":"Yongdong Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongdong","lastName":"Li","id":"37279894000"},{"name":"Zedong Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zedong","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538780100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316470","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":808},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Circuit topology","Diodes","Clamps","Bridge circuits","Capacitors","Switching circuits","Voltage control","Leg","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformerless cascaded multilevel converter topology","generalized multilevel inverter topology","cascaded basic cells","redundant switching states","operating principle","voltage balancing method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["basic cell","cascaded","generalized inverter topology","multilevel converter"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a novel cascaded multilevel converter is proposed.

A laboratory system rated at 400 V and 15 kW is designed and built up to confirm the validity and effectiveness of the nine-level (17-level in line-toline) PWM inverter intended for medium-voltage motor drives.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316479.pdf","startPage":"2557","endPage":"2564","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A modular multilevel PWM inverter for medium-voltage motor drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Medium voltage","Motor drives","Fluctuations","DC motors","Voltage control","Torque","Leg","Capacitors","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motor drives","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular multilevel PWM inverter","medium-voltage motor drives","dc-capacitor voltage fluctuation","power switching devices","voltage fluctuation","fans","blowers","pumps","compressors","load torque","voltage 400 V","power 15 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cascade connection","medium-voltage motor drives","modular multilevel PWM inverters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","displayDocTitle":"A modular multilevel PWM inverter for medium-voltage motor drives","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316479/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10965280","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A modular multilevel PWM inverter for medium-voltage motor drives","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069139S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5316486,"authors":[{"name":"Adam Berry","affiliation":["Energy Technology Division, CSIRO, Mayfield West, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Berry","id":"37529781100"},{"name":"David Cornforth","affiliation":["Energy Technology Division, CSIRO, Mayfield West, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Cornforth","id":"37270357800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2893-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-3721"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-3748"}],"articleNumber":"5316486","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5316486","abstract":"Given the growth of microgrids and decentralised power, heterogeneous multi-inverter systems are becoming increasingly prevalent.

They have merits such as the ability to exert thrust on the secondary without mechanical contact, high acceleration or deceleration, less wheel wear, small turning circle radius and flexible road line. The theory of operation for these machines can be directly derived from rotary induction motors, but several issues involving the transversal edge and the longitudinal end effects, and half-filled slots at the primary ends, need to be investigated. In this paper, a T model equivalent circuit is proposed which is based on one-dimensional magnetic equations of the air-gap, where half-filled slots are considered by an equivalent pole number. Then, it deduces two-axis equivalent circuits to study the SLIM dynamic performance. The theoretical analyses have been validated by experimental results on SLIM prototypes.","doi":"10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316539","startPage":"1288","endPage":"1295","publicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316539.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equivalent circuits for single-sided linear induction motors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316539/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Equivalent circuits for single-sided linear induction motors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5316539/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10965359","publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equivalent circuits for single-sided linear induction motors","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05778S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316539","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":5316540,"authors":[{"name":"Akshay K.

Detailed operation, analysis, design, simulation and experimental results for the proposed converter are presented. The auxiliary active clamping circuit absorbs the turn-off voltage spike and also assists in achieving ZVS of main switches.

In order to facilitate the control of distributed generation systems adapted to the expected change of grid requirements, generalized power control schemes based on symmetric-sequence components are proposed in this paper for inverter-based distributed generation, aiming at manipulating the delivered instantaneous power under voltage dips. It is shown that active power and reactive power can be independently controlled with two individually adaptable parameters. By changing these parameters, the relative amplitudes of oscillating power can be smoothly regulated, as well as the peak values of three-phase grid currents. As a result, the power control of grid-side inverters becomes quite flexible. Furthermore, two strategies for simultaneous active and reactive power control are proposed that preserves adaptive controllability. Finally, the proposed schemes are verified experimentally.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECCE.2009.5316564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5315930","startPage":"3564","endPage":"3571","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5305884/5315930/05316564.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active and reactive power control schemes for distributed generation systems under voltage dips","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5316564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5316564/","displayDocTitle":"Active and reactive power control schemes for distributed generation systems under voltage dips","conferenceDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10965306","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active and reactive power control schemes for distributed generation systems under voltage dips","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"1040.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061941S","chronDate":"20-24 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5305884","isNumber":"5315930","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5305884","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5315930","articleId":"5316564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5317489,"authors":[{"name":"I-wei Kao","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"I-wei","lastName":"Kao","id":"37858077300"},{"name":"Chi-yang Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Chi-yang","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37596424100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-3970-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-3971-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-1847"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-1855"}],"articleNumber":"5317489","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5317489","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Robustness","Conference management","Engineering management","Clustering algorithms","Genetic mutations","Data engineering","Regeneration engineering","Industrial engineering","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["selective regenerated particle swarm optimization","data clustering problem","PSO","local optimal","K-means clustering method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","cognitive and social parameter","data clustering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICMSE.2009.5317489","pdfPath":"/iel5/5293852/5317290/05317489.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 International Conference on Management Science and Engineering","startPage":"141","endPage":"147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5317290","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMSE.2009.5317489","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective regenerated particle swarm optimization for data clustering","abstract":"This paper proposes an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) for data clustering.

According to RBF neural network can realize the nonlinear mapping space from the input space to the output, and can obtain the optimal relationships pattern of the input and output, the customer requirements and engineering characteristics in QFD constituted the input and output of the RBF neural network respectively, the optimal relationships are constructed through the neural network training.

On the other hand, it should be acknowledged that since over ten years the standardization of voltage fluctuations is based on the UIE flickermeter. The author idea is to treat a flickermeter - from its analogue input to the output of block 4 - as a black box, filled in by a designer accordingly to its decision, while maintaining the IN/OUT characteristics in conformity with those of the flickermeter regarded as a standard one.

How to use cloud computing resources efficiently and gain the maximum profits with job scheduling system is one of the cloud computing service providers' ultimate goals. In this paper, firstly, by analysis the differentiated QoS requirements of cloud computing resources users' jobs, we build the corresponding non-preemptive priority M/G/1 queuing model for the jobs. Then, considering cloud computing service providers' destination which is to gain the maximum profits by offering cloud computing resources, we built the system cost function for this queuing model. After that, based on the queuing model and system cost function, considering the goals of both the cloud computing service users and providers, we gave the corresponding strategy and algorithm to get the approximate optimistic value of service for each job in the corresponding no-preemptive priority M/G/1 queuing model. Finally, we also provide corresponding simulations and numerical results. Analysis and number results show that our approach for job scheduling system can not only guarantee the QoS requirements of the users' jobs, but also can make the maximum profits for the cloud computing service providers.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5318882/5318883/05318900.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"299","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering","doi":"10.1109/MUE.2009.58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MUE.2009.58","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5318883","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5318900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Optimistic Differentiated Service Job Scheduling System for Cloud Computing Service Users and Providers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Processor scheduling","Cloud computing","Grid computing","Dynamic scheduling","Cost function","Computational modeling","Environmental economics","Scheduling algorithm","Multimedia systems","Multimedia computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quality of service","queueing theory","scheduling","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimistic differentiated service value","job scheduling system problem","cloud computing service provider","maximum profit","QoS requirement","cloud computing resource user job","system cost function","no-preemptive priority M/G/1 queuing model","numerical result"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Job scheduling system","queuing system","QoS","Little's Law"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5318900/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"An Optimistic Differentiated Service Job Scheduling System for Cloud Computing Service Users and Providers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5318900/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10966054","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Optimistic Differentiated Service Job Scheduling System for Cloud Computing Service Users and Providers","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"3658a295.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065747S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5318882","isNumber":"5318883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5318882","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5318883","articleId":"5318900","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5318912,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-jie Li","affiliation":["Research Institute of Nonlinear Information Technology, Dalian Nationalities of University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-jie","lastName":"Li","id":"37404748600"},{"name":"Xiang-dong Liu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Nonlinear Information Technology, Dalian Nationalities of University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xiang-dong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37406549400"},{"name":"Xiao-dong Duan","affiliation":["Research Institute of Nonlinear Information Technology, Dalian Nationalities of University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Xiao-dong","lastName":"Duan","id":"37402593000"},{"name":"Cun-rui Wang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Nonlinear Information Technology, Dalian Nationalities of University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Cun-rui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37599182900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3658-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5318912","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Particle swarm optimization","Grid computing","Iterative algorithms","Genetic algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Computer networks","Power engineering computing","Information technology","Concurrent computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid computing","iterative methods","particle swarm optimisation","resource allocation","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["grid environment","resource allocation optimization","particle swarm optimization","parallel tasks","universal utility function","computational intractability","iterative searching","grid resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Grid","Resource allocation","Particle swarm optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5318912","abstract":"Resource allocation in grid environment is a complex undertaking due to the heterogeneity and dynamic nature aroused by wide area sharing.

Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is convergent and performs better than genetic algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/MUE.2009.65","pdfPath":"/iel5/5318882/5318883/05318912.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"346","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MUE.2009.65","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5318883","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Solution for Grid Resource Allocation Using Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5318912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Solution for Grid Resource Allocation Using Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","accessionNumber":"10966060","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5318912/","conferenceDate":"4-6 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Solution for Grid Resource Allocation Using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"3658a339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08663S","chronDate":"4-6 June 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5318882","isNumber":"5318883","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5318882","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5318883","articleId":"5318912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5318987,"authors":[{"name":"Tilman Wolf","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Tilman","lastName":"Wolf","id":"37281966000"},{"name":"Russell Tessier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Russell","lastName":"Tessier","id":"37272879000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5087-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3838-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5318987","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Next generation networking","IP networks","Computer architecture","Computer networks","Monitoring","Protocols","Computer security","Data security","Hardware","Protection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","microprocessor chips","monitoring","security of data","system recovery","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network","secure router system","software-programmable embedded processor","SPPP","secure packet processing platform","instruction-level monitoring system","instruction detection system","attack detection","next-generation networks","router design","recovery system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network security","router design","embedded processor","processor monitor"]}],"abstract":"Computer networks are vulnerable to attacks, where the network infrastructure itself is targeted.

If such deviations are detected, a recovery system is invoked to restore the system into an operational state.

The system overhead for secure monitoring is limited to a fraction of the overall space, memory, and power budget.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a Secure Router System for Next-Generation Networks","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Network and System Security","doi":"10.1109/NSS.2009.70","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Network and System Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5318886/5318887/05318987.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"59","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSS.2009.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5318887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5318987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5318987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Design of a Secure Router System for Next-Generation Networks","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5318987/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966131","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a Secure Router System for Next-Generation Networks","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"3838a052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088048S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5318886","isNumber":"5318887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5318886","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5318887","articleId":"5318987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5319068,"authors":[{"name":"Hyunhee Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyunhee","lastName":"Park","id":"37066341200"},{"name":"Meejoung Kim","affiliation":["Research Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Meejoung","lastName":"Kim","id":"37404424800"},{"name":"Chul-Hee Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Chul-Hee","lastName":"Kang","id":"37402153800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5087-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3838-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5319068","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Monitoring","Communication system security","Information security","Communications technology","Gaussian distribution","Adaptive systems","Internet","Computer crime","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","learning (artificial intelligence)","statistical distributions","telecommunication security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic anomaly detection","network security","network administration","traffic monitoring","traffic analysis","Fisher linear discriminant method","self-learning algorithm","real-time detection","WISE-Mon","traffic behavior","wide backbone network traffic identification","statistical estimation monitoring","Internet"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Adaptive defense system","Traffic analysis and measurment","Fisher linear discriminant"]}],"abstract":"Traffic anomaly detection is one of the most important technologies that should be considered in network security and administration. In this paper, we propose a traffic anomaly detection mechanism that includes traffic monitoring and traffic analysis. We develop an analytical system called WISE-Mon that inspects the traffic behavior by monitoring and analyzing the traffic. We establish a criterion for detecting abnormal traffic by analyzing training set of traffic and applying Fisher linear discriminant method. By using the properties of distributions such as chi-square distribution and normal distribution to the training set, we derive a hyperplane which enables to detect abnormal traffic. Since the trend of traffic can be changed as time passes, the hyperplane has to be updated periodically to reflect the changes. Accordingly, we consider the self-learning algorithm which reflects the trend of traffic and so enables to increase accuracy of detection. The proposed mechanism is reliable for traffic anomaly detection and compatible to real-time detection. For the numerical results, we use a traffic set collected from campus network. It shows that the proposed mechanism is reliable and accurate for detecting the abnormal traffic. Furthermore, it is observed that the proposed mechanism can categorize a set of abnormal traffic into various malicious traffic subsets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"F-TAD: Traffic Anomaly Detection for Sub-networks Using Fisher Linear Discriminant","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Network and System Security","doi":"10.1109/NSS.2009.60","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Network and System Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5318886/5318887/05319068.pdf","startPage":"328","endPage":"335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSS.2009.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5318887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5319068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"F-TAD: Traffic Anomaly Detection for Sub-networks Using Fisher Linear Discriminant","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5319068/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966146","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"F-TAD: Traffic Anomaly Detection for Sub-networks Using Fisher Linear Discriminant","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"3838a328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.151285S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5318886","isNumber":"5318887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5318886","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5318887","articleId":"5319068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5319115,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Wang","affiliation":["College of Photoelectric Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing Information and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Wang","id":"37677237900"},{"name":"Shu-Hui Yang","affiliation":["College of Photoelectric Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing Information and Technology University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shu-Hui","lastName":"Yang","id":"37537738300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3570-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5319115","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":303},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a simplification of log-BP algorithm which is able to reduce iterative times of decoding algorithm and save the hardware resource of decoder for LDPC codes.

Because of the vulnerability of the original design of the Internet, attackers can easily mimic the patterns of legitimate network traffic to fly under the radar. The existing fingerprint or feature based algorithms are incapable to detect new attack strategies. In this paper, we aim to differentiate DDoS attack flows from flash crowds. We are motivated by the following fact: the attack flows are generated by the same prebuilt program (attack tools), however, flash crowds come from randomly distributed users all over the Internet. Therefore, the flow similarity among DDoS attack flows is much stronger than that among flash crowds. We employ abstract distance metrics, the Jeffrey distance, the Sibson distance, and the Hellinger distance to measure the similarity among flows to achieve our goal. We compared the three metrics and found that the Sibson distance is the most suitable one for our purpose. We apply our algorithm to the real datasets and the results indicate that the proposed algorithm can differentiate them with an accuracy around 65%.","doi":"10.1109/NSS.2009.29","startPage":"351","endPage":"356","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Network and System Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/5318886/5318887/05319279.pdf","publicationTitle":"2009 Third International Conference on Network and System Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NSS.2009.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5318887","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminating DDoS Flows from Flash Crowds Using Information Distance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer crime","Detectors","Internet","Computer hacking","Telecommunication traffic","Information security","Fingerprint recognition","Radar detection","Entropy","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discriminating DDoS flows","flash crowds","information distance","flooding attacks","network security","Internet","legitimate network traffic","feature based algorithms","fingerprint algorithms","flow similarity","abstract distance metrics","Jeffrey distance","Sibson distance","Hellinger distance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DDoS Attack","Distance","Measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319279/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","displayDocTitle":"Discriminating DDoS Flows from Flash Crowds Using Information Distance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5319279/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966150","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminating DDoS Flows from Flash Crowds Using Information Distance","confLoc":"Gold Coast, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"3838a351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.20255S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5318886","isNumber":"5318887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5318886","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"5318887","articleId":"5319279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5319316,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

Our methodology is applied to the boundaries of 30 cutaneous lesions and classification algorithms are consequently utilised to evaluate the effectiveness of descriptors for differentiating between regular / irregular borders and between benign/malignant tumours. Results indicate that generated parameters have high discriminative value when differentiating between benign and malignant lesions: maximum classification accuracy achieved was 93.3%, with 80% sensitivity.","doi":"10.1109/IMVIP.2009.11","publicationTitle":"2009 13th International Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 13th International Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5319272/5319273/05319347.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMVIP.2009.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319273","startPage":"18","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Pigmented Skin Lesion Border Irregularity Using the Harmonic Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5319347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Pigmented Skin Lesion Border Irregularity Using the Harmonic Wavelet Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319347/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966518","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5319347/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Pigmented Skin Lesion Border Irregularity Using the Harmonic Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Dublin, Ireland","sourcePdf":"3796a018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056503S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5319272","isNumber":"5319273","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5319272","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5319273","articleId":"5319347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-02"},{"_id":5319352,"authors":[{"name":"Lily D.

The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm needs no training data with fast convergence.","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5318889/5319354/05319453.pdf","startPage":"472","endPage":"475","publicationTitle":"2009 WRI World Congress on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/WCSE.2009.293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCSE.2009.293","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319354","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5319453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Output Power Maximizing Timing Recovery Algorithm for Rectangle QAM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Timing","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal processing algorithms","Clocks","Matched filters","Sampling methods","Software algorithms","Quadrature phase shift keying","AWGN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","fading channels","multipath channels","quadrature amplitude modulation","quadrature phase shift keying","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["output power maximizing timing recovery algorithm","rectangle QAM","QPSK signal","AWGN","multipath fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QAM","Timing Recovery","Output Power Maximizing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Output Power Maximizing Timing Recovery Algorithm for Rectangle QAM","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5319453/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10966300","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Output Power Maximizing Timing Recovery Algorithm for Rectangle QAM","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"3570c472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042463S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5318889","isNumber":"5319354","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5318889","xplore-issue":"5319354","articleId":"5319453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5319493,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Li","id":"37539242100"},{"name":"Guanqun Qian","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guanqun","lastName":"Qian","id":"37683431200"},{"name":"Li Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538570000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3570-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5319493","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"abstract":"Software changes are inevitable in the process of software evolution.

Aiming at the issue, this paper proposes a solution based on quantum genetic algorithm with double chains. Firstly, the number of genes is determined by the number of weight parameters, quantum chromosomes are constructed by qubits, and the current optimal chromosome is obtained with the help of colony assessment. Secondly, taking each qubit in this optimal chromosome as the goal, individuals are updated by quantum rotation gate, and mutated by quantum non-gate to increase the diversity of population. In this method, each chromosome carrying two chains of genes, therefore it can extend ergodicity for solution space and accelerate optimization process. Taking the pattern classification of two groups of two-dimensional trigonometric functions as an example, the simulation results show that the method not only has fast convergence, but also good optimization ability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319690/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10974401","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5319690/","publicationDate":"May 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Training of Process Neural Networks Based on Improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training of Process Neural Networks Based on Improved Quantum Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Xiamen, China","sourcePdf":"3570b160.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048011S","chronDate":"19-21 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5318889","isNumber":"5319433","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5318889","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5319433","articleId":"5319690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5319723,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Based on this generic model, a TFT compact dc model that meets the requirements for compact modeling, including for computer circuit simulators, is proposed. The models are fully symmetrical, and the TFT compact dc model covers all regimes of TFT operation-linear and saturation above threshold, subthreshold, and reverse biasing. The empirical fitting parameters are mostly eliminated from the characteristic equations. The developed models are also in close correspondence to several physical, parametric, and limiting models for current-voltage and mobility characteristics. An essential practical feature of the TFT compact dc model is that the model is both upgradable and reducible, allowing for easier implementation and modifications and also simultaneously allowing for separation of characterization techniques. This allows for systematic fitting of experimental data with large scattering in the values, but at the same time, preserving consistently the OTFT behavior in the model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319724/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","volume":"56","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10978944","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5319724/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Organic Thin-Film Transistors: Part I\u2014Compact DC Modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Organic Thin-Film Transistors: Part I\u2014Compact DC Modeling","sourcePdf":"ted-deen-2033308.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064066S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5319722","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"169","xplore-issue":"5319722","articleId":"5319724","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5319728,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Boyer","affiliation":["National Institute for Applied Sciences, Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/5319721/5319728/5319728-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Alexandre Boyer was born in Annemasse, France, in 1981.

Most of this work has focused on the finite-dimensional setting in which the goal is to decompose a finite-length vector into a given finite dictionary. Underlying many of these results is the conceptual notion of an uncertainty principle: a signal cannot be sparsely represented in two different bases. Here, we extend these ideas and results to the analog, infinite-dimensional setting by considering signals that lie in a finitely generated shift-invariant (SI) space. This class of signals is rich enough to include many interesting special cases such as multiband signals and splines. By adapting the notion of coherence defined for finite dictionaries to infinite SI representations, we develop an uncertainty principle similar in spirit to its finite counterpart. We demonstrate tightness of our bound by considering a bandlimited lowpass train that achieves the uncertainty principle. Building upon these results and similar work in the finite setting, we show how to find a sparse decomposition in an overcomplete dictionary by solving a convex optimization problem. The distinguishing feature of our approach is the fact that even though the problem is defined over an infinite domain with infinitely many variables and constraints, under certain conditions on the dictionary spectrum our algorithm can find the sparsest representation by solving a finite-dimensional problem.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2032711","startPage":"5742","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5319729/05319739.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2032711","endPage":"5757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uncertainty Relations for Shift-Invariant Analog Signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319739/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Uncertainty Relations for Shift-Invariant Analog Signals","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5319739/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10979008","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uncertainty Relations for Shift-Invariant Analog Signals","sourcePdf":"55tit12-yeldar-2032711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119255S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5319729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5319729","articleId":"5319739","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5319742,"authors":[{"name":"Alyson K.

A new necessary condition on the number of measurements for asymptotically reliable detection with maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation and Gaussian measurement matrices is derived. This necessary condition for ML detection is compared against a sufficient condition for simple maximum correlation (MC) or thresholding algorithms. The analysis shows that the gap between thresholding and ML can be described by a simple expression in terms of the total signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with the gap growing with increasing SNR. Thresholding is also compared against the more sophisticated Lasso and orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) methods. At high SNRs, it is shown that the gap between Lasso and OMP over thresholding is described by the range of powers of the nonzero component values of the unknown signals. Specifically, the key benefit of Lasso and OMP over thresholding is the ability of Lasso and OMP to detect signals with relatively small components.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5319729/05319742.pdf","startPage":"5758","endPage":"5772","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2032726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2032726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5319742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Sparsity Pattern Recovery","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sufficient conditions","Matching pursuit algorithms","Maximum likelihood estimation","Sparse matrices","Vectors","Noise measurement","Additive noise","Maximum likelihood detection","Signal processing","Noise level"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood estimation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparsity pattern recovery","k-sparse vector","random noisy measurement","asymptotically reliable detection","maximum-likelihood estimation","Gaussian measurement matrices","maximum correlation","thresholding algorithm","signal-to-noise ratio","Lasso","orthogonal matching pursuit","signal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","convex optimization","Lasso","maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation","orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP)","random matrices","random projections","sparse approximation","subset selection","thresholding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319742/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Sparsity Pattern Recovery","volume":"55","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979007","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Sparsity Pattern Recovery","sourcePdf":"55tit12-vgoyal-2032726.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061029S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","isNumber":"5319729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"115","articleId":"5319742","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":5319743,"authors":[{"name":"Dinesh Krithivasan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Dinesh Krithivasan (S'08\u2013M'09) received the M.S. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2005.","He is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree at the University of Michigan.

Each receiver employs a successive group decoder with a specified complexity constraint, to decode its designated user. It is aware of the coding schemes employed by all other users and may choose to decode some or all of them only if it deems that doing so will aid the decoding of its desired user. For a GIC with predetermined rates for all transmitters, we obtain the minimum outage probability decoding strategy at each receiver which satisfies the imposed complexity constraint and reveals the optimal subset of interferers that must be decoded along with the desired user. We then consider the rate allocation problem over the GIC under successive group decoding and design a sequential rate allocation algorithm which yields a Pareto-optimal rate allocation, and two parallel rate allocation algorithms which yield the symmetric fair rate allocation and the max-min fair rate allocation, respectively. Remarkably, even though the proposed decoding and rate allocation algorithms use ldquogreedyrdquo or myopic subroutines, they achieve globally optimal solutions. Finally, we also propose rate allocation algorithms for a cognitive radio system.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5319729/05319748.pdf","startPage":"5540","endPage":"5557","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2032725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2032725","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5319748","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Minimization and Rate Allocation for the Multiuser Gaussian Interference Channels With Successive Group Decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference channels","Decoding","Frequency","Interference constraints","Iterative algorithms","Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Radio transmitters","Algorithm design and analysis","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","channel coding","cognitive radio","computational complexity","decoding","Gaussian channels","greedy algorithms","group codes","memoryless systems","minimax techniques","minimisation","multiuser channels","parallel algorithms","Pareto optimisation","probability","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum outage probability decoding strategy","symmetric fair rate allocation algorithm","multiuser memoryless Gaussian interference channel coding scheme","GIC","successive group decoding","single-antenna user","Gaussian codebook","radio receiver","successive group decoder","complexity constraint","radio transmitter","optimal subset","Pareto-optimal rate allocation problem","parallel rate allocation algorithm","max-min fair rate allocation","greedy subroutine","myopic subroutine","cognitive radio system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Gaussian interference channel (GIC)","greedy algorithms","max-min fairness","polymatroids","rate allocation","successive group decoding","symmetric fairness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319748/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Outage Minimization and Rate Allocation for the Multiuser Gaussian Interference Channels With Successive Group Decoding","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5319748/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10979009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage Minimization and Rate Allocation for the Multiuser Gaussian Interference Channels With Successive Group Decoding","sourcePdf":"55tit12-nprasad-2032725.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083909S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5319729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5319729","articleId":"5319748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5319749,"authors":[{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["CWCSPR, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Osvaldo Simeone (M'02) received the M.Sc. degree (with honors) and the Ph.D. degree in information engineering from Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 2001 and 2005, respectively.","He is currently with the Center for Wireless Communications and Signal Processing Research (CWCSPR), Department of Electrical and Computer engineering, at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark, where he is an Assistant Professor.

The source has access to each of the transmit antennas through a finite-capacity link, and likewise the destination is connected to the receiving antennas via capacity-constrained channels (e.g., as for wired or time-division multiple access (TDMA) channels). Targeting a nomadic communication scenario, in which the remote MIMO transceiver is designed to serve different standards or services, it is assumed that transmitters and receivers are oblivious to the encoding function shared by source and destination. Assuming a Gaussian symmetric interference network as the channel model (as for regularly placed transmitters and receivers), achievable rates are investigated and compared with an upper bound (that holds also for codebook-dependent operation). Closed-form expressions are derived for large numbers of antennas (and in some cases large signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs)), and asymptotics of the achievable rates are studied with respect to either link capacities or SNR. Overall, the analysis points to effective transmission/reception strategies for the distributed MIMO channel at hand, which are optimal under specified conditions. In particular, it is concluded that in certain asymptotic and nonasymptotic regimes there is no loss of optimality in designing the system for nomadic applications (i.e., assuming oblivious transmitters and receivers). Numerical results validate the analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5319729/05319749.pdf","startPage":"5558","endPage":"5574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2032730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2032730","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5319749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed MIMO Systems for Nomadic Applications Over a Symmetric Interference Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference channels","Transmitters","Transceivers","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Time division multiple access","Communication standards","Upper bound","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","interference (signal)","MIMO communication","mobile communication","multi-access systems","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed MIMO system","symmetric interference channel","remote wireless multiple antenna","multiple-input multiple-output transceiver","nomadic communication","Gaussian symmetric interference","codebook dependent operation","oblivious cooperation","multirelay channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed processing","multiple-inpute multiple-output (MIMO) systems","multirelay channels","oblivious cooperation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"Distributed MIMO Systems for Nomadic Applications Over a Symmetric Interference Channel","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5319749/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978989","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed MIMO Systems for Nomadic Applications Over a Symmetric Interference Channel","sourcePdf":"55tit12-osimeone-2032730.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.132862S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5319729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5319729","articleId":"5319749","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5319750,"authors":[{"name":"Martin J.

This naturally leads to a family of REacutenyi-like quantum conditional entropies, for which the von Neumann entropy emerges as a special case.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2032797","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5319729/05319753.pdf","startPage":"5840","endPage":"5847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2032797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fully Quantum Asymptotic Equipartition Property","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5319753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319753/","displayDocTitle":"A Fully Quantum Asymptotic Equipartition Property","volume":"55","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978986","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5319753/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fully Quantum Asymptotic Equipartition Property","sourcePdf":"55tit12-mtomamichel-2032797.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08824S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5319729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"183","xplore-issue":"5319729","articleId":"5319753","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5319754,"authors":[{"name":"Lee K.

This theory provides best mean squared finite sample error bounds for some popular statistical learning algorithms and also for several optimal improvements of other existing learning algorithms such as smoothing splines and kernel regularization. The bounds and improved algorithms are not based on asymptotics or Bayesian assumptions and are truly local for each query, not depending on cross validating estimates at other queries to optimize modeling parameters. Results are given for optimal local learning of approximately linear functions with side information (context) using real algebraic geometry. In particular, finite sample error bounds are given for ridge regression and for a local version of lasso regression. The new regression methods require only quadratic programming with linear or quadratic inequality constraints for implementation. Greedy additive expansions are then combined with local minimax learning via a change in metric. An optimal strategy is presented for fusing the local minimax estimators of a class of experts-providing optimal finite sample prediction error bounds from (random) forests. Local minimax learning is extended to kernel machines. Best local prediction error bounds for finite samples are given for Tikhonov regularization. The geometry of reproducing kernel Hilbert space is used to derive improved estimators with finite sample mean squared error (MSE) bounds for class membership probability in two class pattern classification problems. A purely local, cross validation free algorithm is proposed which uses Fisher information with these bounds to determine best local kernel shape in vector machine learning. Finally, a locally quadratic solution to the finite Fourier moments problem is presented. After reading the first three sections the reader may proceed directly to any of the subsequent applications sections.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2027479","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2027479","startPage":"5700","endPage":"5727","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5319729/05319754.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Minimax Learning of Functions With Best Finite Sample Estimation Error Bounds: Applications to Ridge and Lasso Regression, Boosting, Tree Learning, Kernel Machines, and Inverse Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Local Minimax Learning of Functions With Best Finite Sample Estimation Error Bounds: Applications to Ridge and Lasso Regression, Boosting, Tree Learning, Kernel Machines, and Inverse Problems","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","volume":"55","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5319754/","accessionNumber":"10978984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319754/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Minimax Learning of Functions With Best Finite Sample Estimation Error Bounds: Applications to Ridge and Lasso Regression, Boosting, Tree Learning, Kernel Machines, and Inverse Problems","sourcePdf":"55tit10-ljones-2027479.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.155206S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5319729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5319729","articleId":"5319754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5319755,"authors":[{"name":"Lalitha Sankar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Lalitha","lastName":"Sankar","id":"37320277200"},{"name":"Narayan B.

The rate-delay tradeoff is formulated as a calculus problem on a capacity region of a related abstracted broadcast channel. Given this general framework for studying such rate-delay tradeoffs, the extreme case of uniform networks, in which each possible received packet arrival order is equally likely, is considered. For these networks, the rate-delay calculus problem is simplified to an integer programming problem, which for small numbers of packets may be solved explicitly, or for larger numbers of packets, may be accurately approximated through the calculus of variations by appropriate relaxation of an integer constraint. Explicit expressions for the rate-delay tradeoff in uniform networks are presented in the special cases of (i) constant packet inter-arrival times, and (ii) exponential independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) packet arrival times.

Due to stringent power and bandwidth constraints, vector quantization is performed at each sensor to convert its local noisy vector observation into one bit of information, which is then forwarded to a fusion center where a final estimate of the vector parameter is obtained. Within such a context, this paper focuses on a class of hyperplane-based vector quantizers which linearly convert the observation vector into a scalar by using a compression vector and then carry out a scalar quantization. It is shown that the key of the vector quantization design is to find a compression vector for each sensor. Under the framework of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) analysis, the compression vector design problem is formulated as an optimization problem that minimizes the trace of the CRB matrix. Such an optimization problem is extensively studied. In particular, an efficient iterative algorithm is developed for the general case, along with optimal and near-optimal solutions for some specific but important noise scenarios. Performance analysis and simulation results are carried out to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2032856","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5319729/05319761.pdf","startPage":"5682","endPage":"5699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2032856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperplane-Based Vector Quantization for Distributed Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5319761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319761/","displayDocTitle":"Hyperplane-Based Vector Quantization for Distributed Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"55","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978979","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5319761/","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperplane-Based Vector Quantization for Distributed Estimation in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"55tit12-hli-2032856.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.169494S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5319729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5319729","articleId":"5319761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5319764,"authors":[{"name":"Da-ke He","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

For coherent network coding, where knowledge of the network topology and network code is assumed at the source and destination nodes, the error correction capability of an (outer) code is succinctly described by the rank metric; as a consequence, it is shown that universal network error correcting codes achieving the Singleton bound can be easily constructed and efficiently decoded. For noncoherent network coding, where knowledge of the network topology and network code is not assumed, the error correction capability of a (subspace) code is given exactly by a new metric, called the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">injection metric</i>\n, which is closely related to, but different than, the subspace metric of KOumltter and Kschischang. In particular, in the case of a non-constant-dimension code, the decoder associated with the injection metric is shown to correct more errors then a minimum-subspace-distance decoder. All of these results are based on a general approach to adversarial error correction, which could be useful for other adversarial channels beyond network coding.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5319729/05319765.pdf","startPage":"5479","endPage":"5490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2009.2032817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2009.2032817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5319729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5319765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Metrics for Error Correction in Network Coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Network coding","Network topology","Decoding","Heart","Error correction","Galois fields","Brazil Council","Information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correcting codes","network coding","adversarial channels","injection distance","rank distance","subspace codes","Singleton bound","minimum-subspace-distance decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adversarial channels","error correction","injection distance","network coding","rank distance","subspace codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5319765/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 November 2009","displayDocTitle":"On Metrics for Error Correction in Network Coding","volume":"55","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5319765/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2009","accessionNumber":"10978997","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Metrics for Error Correction in Network Coding","sourcePdf":"55tit12-dsilva-2032817.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084203S","chronDate":"Dec.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5319729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5319729","articleId":"5319765","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"}]
