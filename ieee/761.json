Inspired by human biometrics, this paper presents a novel approach that enables home appliances to have unique identities based on the intrinsic features of a CMOS image sensor (CIS) embedded in their electronic eyes (i.e., inbuilt cameras). More specifically, the column component of the fixed pattern noise (FPN) that inevitably exists in most modern CISs is utilized as a unique feature of the CIS for describing a unique ID for the embedded system. To practically capture column FPNs that were originally canceled out by a correlated double sampling (CDS) process, this paper also proposes a novel readout scheme. The feasibility of the proposed CIS-based identification is assessed with real measurements using 12 CIS prototypes. In conclusion, a set of applications requiring unique device identifications are presented for demonstrating the utility of the proposed approach in the domain of consumer electronics.\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2016.7613186","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/7613181/07613186.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2016.7613186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7613181","startPage":"209","endPage":"215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biometrics for electronic eyes: system authentication with embedded CMOS image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7613186","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Biometrics for electronic eyes: system authentication with embedded CMOS image sensor","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7613186/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"3","publicationDate":"August 2016","accessionNumber":"16411068","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7613186/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biometrics for electronic eyes: system authentication with embedded CMOS image sensor","sourcePdf":"p209-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073842S","chronDate":"August  2016","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"7613181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7613181","articleId":"7613186","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-11"},{"_id":7613189,"authors":[{"name":"Adriana C.

In order to supply their energy requirements, the consumers have changed the paradigm by integrating renewable energy sources to their power grid. Therefore, consumers become prosumers in which they internally generate and consume energy looking for an autonomous operation.

In addition, storage class memories (SCMs) bridge the bandwidth gap between DRAM and NAND flash, thus introducing SCM to SSD further improves the solid storage performance. Different from schemes that use SCM to store file system metadata or logical to physical mapping tables, two architectures 1) use SCM as a write-back non-volatile memory (NVM) based cache, 2) use SCM as a storage device are presented in this paper. Since SCM chip latency varies due to memory device and circuit design, three SSD data management algorithms are evaluated under five SCM chip design scenarios to provide useful design guidelines of SCM/NAND flash hybrid SSD. SCM interface and capacity requirement are also analyzed. From the experimental results, less than 10% of the SCM/NAND flash capacity ratio is enough for SCM chips with 500 ns read and 5 \u03bcs write latency to boost NAND flash-only SSD speed by over 10 times when workloads own high IO skew\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2016.7613193","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/7613181/07613193.pdf","startPage":"267","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2016.7613193","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7613181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design guidelines of storage class memory/flash hybrid solid-state drive considering system architecture, algorithm and workload characteristic","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design guidelines of storage class memory/flash hybrid solid-state drive considering system architecture, algorithm and workload characteristic","volume":"62","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16411066","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7613193/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7613193/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design guidelines of storage class memory/flash hybrid solid-state drive considering system architecture, algorithm and workload characteristic","sourcePdf":"p267-sun.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064608S","chronDate":"August  2016","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"7613181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7613181","articleId":"7613193","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7613201,"authors":[{"name":"Dongsik Jo","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Korea University, Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/30/7613181/7613201/7613201-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dongsik Jo received his MS degree in computer engineering from POSTECH in 2003.

To further improve the AR tracking performance, which often depends on feature appearances, this paper introduces a method in which the preferred tracking method is determined by the very IoT object in hand. The proposed concept of ARIoT is demonstrated, and its performance is evaluated and compared with the conventional single serveror client-based AR implementation. In addition, a pilot usability test is conducted between a spatially registered visual in-situ AR interface using ARIoT and a conventional interface based only on an online connection, and the results are then compared. This study shows how AR and IoT can be complementary to each other: AR as an attractive visual insitu interface for IoT objects and IoT as a basis for scalable AR\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n.","doi":"10.1109/TCE.2016.7613201","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCE.2016.7613201","startPage":"334","endPage":"340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/30/7613181/07613201.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7613181","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARIoT: scalable augmented reality framework for interacting with Internet of Things appliances everywhere","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7613201/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 October 2016","displayDocTitle":"ARIoT: scalable augmented reality framework for interacting with Internet of Things appliances everywhere","volume":"62","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2016","accessionNumber":"16411077","publicationDate":"August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7613201/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ARIoT: scalable augmented reality framework for interacting with Internet of Things appliances everywhere","sourcePdf":"p334-jo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055206S","chronDate":"August  2016","xplore-pub-id":"30","isNumber":"7613181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7613181","articleId":"7613201","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"}]
