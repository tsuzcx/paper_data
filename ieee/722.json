This fading causes deep fade on signal spectrum at one particular frequency. To overcome this problem, many researchers proposed a multi-carrier technique, which divides wideband signal bandwidth into multiple narrowband signal before transmitted using certain number of subcarriers. By using this technique, the depth fade can be localized, hence only one subcarrier will be affected such that the number of error bit can be minimize. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is a form of multi-carrier technique which uses bandwidth effectively. This OFDM system can be implemented on Wireless Open-Access Research Platform (WARP) that is one of the Software Defined Radio (SDR). By implementing OFDM on WARP module, the bit error rate (BER) system performance can be analysis in the real channel. The implementation of OFDM technique on WARP modul is based on IEEE 802.11 standard. If the range between transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) short enough (less than 10 m), the distance variation didn't affect the BER performance significantly. Whereas, if there is an obstacle between transmitter and receiver, the BER will increase significantly compared no obstacle (dear condition) for short range Tx-Rx distance. For example, BER is 0 in clear condition when the transmit power is -26.125 dBm, meanwhile the BER value is 9.3 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n in obstacle condition and for short range distance, the objects near propagation path provide reflected signal power with significant contribution.","doi":"10.1109/ISITIA.2015.7220024","publicationTitle":"2015 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Seminar on Intelligent Technology and Its Applications (ISITIA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203314/7219932/07220024.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISITIA.2015.7220024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7219932","startPage":"451","endPage":"456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation and performance evaluation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) using WARP","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7220024","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation and performance evaluation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) using WARP","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7220024/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-21 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15412657","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7220024/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation and performance evaluation of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) using WARP","confLoc":"Surabaya, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"7625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045629S","chronDate":"20-21 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7203314","isNumber":"7219932","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203314","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7219932","articleId":"7220024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7220119,"authors":[{"name":"Mahantesh P Mattada","affiliation":["Sanjay Ghodawat group of Institutions, Kolhapur, India"],"firstName":"Mahantesh P","lastName":"Mattada","id":"37076849300"},{"name":"Sachin M Magadum","affiliation":["Rajarambapu Institute of Technology, Islampur, India"],"firstName":"Sachin M","lastName":"Magadum","id":"37085752978"},{"name":"Hansraj Guhilot","affiliation":["KC College of Engineering Kopri, Thane, India"],"firstName":"Hansraj","lastName":"Guhilot","id":"37394969600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8018-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7220119","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Temperature sensors","Temperature measurement","Field programmable gate arrays","Oscillators","Standards","Pulse generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed sensors","field programmable gate arrays","pulse generators","time-digital conversion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hotspots identification","FPGA","distributed tiny sensors","digital time-domain temperature sensors","manual floor-planning","digital output coding","Vernier time to digital converter","digital output coding","picoseconds resolution","logical elements","word length 9 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Time to Digital Converter","Vernier TDC","Ring oscillator","Temperature Sensor","FPGA implementation","High resolution","Low cost"]}],"abstract":"Fully digital time-domain temperature sensors are designed and placed at five different positions within FPGA.

The sensor nodes are densely deployed in a hostile environment to monitor, detect, and analyze the physical phenomenon and consume considerable amount of energy while transmitting the information. It is impractical and sometimes impossible to replace the battery and to maintain longer network life time. So, there is a limitation on the lifetime of the battery power and energy conservation is a challenging issue. Appropriate cluster head (CH) election is one such issue, which can reduce the energy consumption dramatically. Low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH) is the most famous hierarchical routing protocol, where the CH is elected in rotation basis based on a probabilistic threshold value and only CHs are allowed to send the information to the base station (BS). But in this approach, a super-CH (SCH) is elected among the CHs who can only send the information to the mobile BS by choosing suitable fuzzy descriptors, such as remaining battery power, mobility of BS, and centrality of the clusters. Fuzzy inference engine (Mamdani's rule) is used to elect the chance to be the SCH. The results have been derived from NS-2 simulator and show that the proposed protocol performs better than the LEACH protocol in terms of the first node dies, half node alive, better stability, and better lifetime.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2472970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7352393/07222367.pdf","startPage":"137","endPage":"144","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2472970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fuzzy Logic-Based Clustering Algorithm for WSN to Extend the Network Lifetime","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222367","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222367/","displayDocTitle":"A Fuzzy Logic-Based Clustering Algorithm for WSN to Extend the Network Lifetime","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15677574","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222367/","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fuzzy Logic-Based Clustering Algorithm for WSN to Extend the Network Lifetime","sourcePdf":"jsen-nayak-2472970-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063604S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7352393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"240","xplore-issue":"7352393","articleId":"7222367","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7222375,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengshan J.

In response, manufacturers of flat-plate silicon photovoltaic (PV) cells have pushed cell efficiencies above 25%-nearing the 29.4% detailed-balance efficiency limit-and both solar thermal and battery storage technologies have been deployed at utility scale. This paper introduces a new tandem solar collector employing a \u201cPVMirror\u201d that has the potential to both increase energy conversion efficiency and provide thermal storage. A PVMirror is a concentrating mirror, spectrum splitter, and light-to-electricity converter all in one: It consists of a curved arrangement of PV cells that absorb part of the solar spectrum and reflect the remainder to their shared focus, at which a second solar converter is placed. A strength of the design is that the solar converter at the focus can be of a radically different technology than the PV cells in the PVMirror; another is that the PVMirror converts a portion of the diffuse light to electricity in addition to the direct light. We consider two case studies-a PV cell located at the focus of the PVMirror to form a four-terminal PV-PV tandem, and a thermal receiver located at the focus to form a PV-CSP (concentrating solar thermal power) tandem-and compare the outdoor energy outputs to those of competing technologies. PVMirrors can outperform (idealized) monolithic PV-PV tandems that are under concentration, and they can also generate nearly as much energy as silicon flat-plate PV while simultaneously providing the full energy storage benefit of CSP.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7300475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOTOV.2015.2458571","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of

The model extends and adapts the Randel et al., framework for advanced modulation format transmission in intensity-modulated direct-detection for the VLC channel. The main contributions are: CAP modulation, effect of transmit signal spectral shaping in PAM and CAP, analytical calculation of crest factor for CAP, and analysis of inter-symbol and cross-carrier interference due to an insufficient cyclic-prefix in DMT. Based on this model, the impact of blue filtering at the receiver is studied in the context of spectrally efficient modulation formats. The results indicate that blue filtering has a marginal effect on the performance for all the investigated modulation formats, while PAM with decision feedback equalizer shows the best performance. Without blue filtering, slightly higher data rates can be achieved, but at a price of extensive signal processing.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2472575","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7273735/07222376.pdf","startPage":"4413","endPage":"4423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2472575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced Modulation Formats in Phosphorous LED VLC Links and the Impact of Blue Filtering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Advanced Modulation Formats in Phosphorous LED VLC Links and the Impact of Blue Filtering","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222376/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2015","volume":"33","issue":"21","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222376/","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15591507","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Dean of Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology"},{"fundingName":"Warsaw University of Technology"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004895","fundingName":"European Social Fund"},{"fundingName":"Warsaw University of Technology Development Program"},{"fundingName":"Center for Advanced Studies"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced Modulation Formats in Phosphorous LED VLC Links and the Impact of Blue Filtering","sourcePdf":"jlt-stepniak-2472575-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080361S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7273735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"7273735","articleId":"7222376","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":7222378,"authors":[{"name":"Chunyu Chen","affiliation":["College of Information and Communication Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7286895/7222378/chen-2472960-small.gif","p":["Chunyu Chen received the B.S. degree in mechanical and electrical engineering from Shenyang Aerospace University, China, in 1997, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in signal and information processing from the Harbin Institute of Technology, China, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.","He was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with the Electronic Science and Engineering School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, from 2006 to 2010.

Different from the previous work that uses independent local feature, the algorithm explores the global moving relation between the current behavior state and the previous behavior state. Due to the unstable optical flow resulting in the unstable speed, a new global acceleration feature is proposed, based on the gray-scale invariance of three adjacent frames. It can ensure the pixels matching and reflect the change of speed accurately. Furthermore, a detection algorithm is designed by acceleration computation with a foreground extraction step. The proposed algorithm is independent of the human detection and segmentation, so it is robust. For anomaly detection, this paper formulates the abnormal event detection as a two-classified problem, which is more robust than the statistic model-based methods, and this two-classified detection algorithm, which is based on the threshold analysis, detects anomalous crowd behaviors in the current frame. Finally, apply the method to detect abnormal behaviors on several benchmark data sets, and show promising results.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2472960","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7286895/07222378.pdf","startPage":"7252","endPage":"7261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2472960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Anomalous Crowd Behavior Based on the Acceleration Feature","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222378","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222378/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Anomalous Crowd Behavior Based on the Acceleration Feature","volume":"15","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15518952","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222378/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61175126"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs Foundation through the Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20112304110009"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds through the Central Universities","grantNumber":"HEUCFZ1209"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Anomalous Crowd Behavior Based on the Acceleration Feature","sourcePdf":"jsen-shao-2472960-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080577S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7286895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7286895","articleId":"7222378","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7222390,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The self-resetting function is implemented using a four-transistor Schmitt trigger inverter. The pixel has no counter for the number of self-resets, because the application does not require radiometric (linear) response. The pixel is fabricated using the 0.35-\u03bcm 2-poly 4-metal standard CMOS technology, which results in the pixel size of 15 \u03bcm\u00d715 \u03bcm and a fill factor of 31%.

By input delay approach, the resulting sampled-data system is reformulated as a continuous system with time-varying delay in the control input. A continuous Lyapunov functional, which captures the information on sampling pattern, together with the free-weighting matrix method, is then used to establish a sufficient condition for consensusability. For a more general case that the sampled-data controllers are subject to constant input delays, a novel discontinuous Lyapunov functional is introduced on the basis of the vector extension of Wirtinger's inequality. This functional can lead to simplified and efficient stability conditions for computation and optimization. Further results on the estimate of maximal allowable sampling interval upper bound is given as well. Numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness and merits of the proposed protocol.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2466115","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7542212/07222408.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2466115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542212","startPage":"2132","endPage":"2143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Consensus of Multiagent Systems Using Aperiodic Sampled-Data Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222408","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Consensus of Multiagent Systems Using Aperiodic Sampled-Data Control","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222408/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"46","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231748","pubMedId":"26316291","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7222408/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61304072"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2012AA041703"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP140102180, LP140100471 and LE150100079"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B12018"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005153","fundingName":"China National Funds for Distinguished Young Scientists","grantNumber":"61425009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Consensus of Multiagent Systems Using Aperiodic Sampled-Data Control","sourcePdf":"tcyb-su-2466115-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11757S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7542212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"123","xplore-issue":"7542212","articleId":"7222408","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7222419,"authors":[{"name":"Jung-Bin Kim","affiliation":["Broadcasting & Telecommunications Media Research Laboratory, ETRI, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jung-Bin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37293490400"},{"name":"In-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Control Engineering, and IITC, Hankyong National University, Anseong, Korea"],"firstName":"In-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37292231600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7222419","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":259,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":4138},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222419","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Approximation methods","Relays","Fading","Spatial diversity","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","cooperative communication","decode and forward communication","Rayleigh channels","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity analysis","cooperative relaying systems","non-orthogonal multiple access","NOMA","Rayleigh fading channels","suboptimal power allocation scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cooperative relaying","non-orthogonal multiple access","decode-and-forward relaying","rate analysis","Rayleigh fading channels"]},{"kwd":["Cooperative relaying","non-orthogonal multiple access","decode-and-forward relaying","rate analysis","Rayleigh fading channels."]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose the cooperative relaying system using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to improve the spectral efficiency.

While this paradigm has led to numerous empirical successes in various fields ranging from image to audio processing, there have only been a few theoretical arguments supporting these evidences. In particular, sparse coding, or sparse dictionary learning, relies on a non-convex procedure whose local minima have not been fully analyzed yet. In this paper, we consider a probabilistic model of sparse signals, and show that, with high probability, sparse coding admits a local minimum around the reference dictionary generating the signals. This paper considers the case of over-complete dictionaries, noisy signals, and possible outliers, thus extending the previous work limited to noiseless settings and/or undercomplete dictionaries. The analysis we conduct is non-asymptotic and makes it possible to understand how the key quantities of the problem, such as the coherence or the level of noise, can scale with respect to the dimension of the signals, the number of atoms, the sparsity, and the number of observations.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2472522","startPage":"6298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7299738/07222421.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2472522","endPage":"6319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299738","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse and Spurious: Dictionary Learning With Noise and Outliers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222421/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Sparse and Spurious: Dictionary Learning With Noise and Outliers","volume":"61","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7222421/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15524600","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Future and Emerging Technologies\u2013Open Programme through the SMALL Project","grantNumber":"225913"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council through the PLEASE Project","grantNumber":"ERC-StG-2011-277906"},{"fundingName":"SIERRA Project","grantNumber":"ERC-StG-2011-239993"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse and Spurious: Dictionary Learning With Noise and Outliers","sourcePdf":"tit-bach-2472522-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13866S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7299738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7299738","articleId":"7222421","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7222428,"authors":[{"name":"Anyu Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"p":["Anyu Wang received the B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics from Nankai University in 2008 and the Ph.D. degree in Applied Mathematics from the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2015.

Optimal control of the MMC requires determination of the following: 1) an accurate MMC model, 2) the MMC states to be controlled and their corresponding reference trajectories, and 3) an appropriate controller type/form and its parameters. The aforementioned tasks lead to the formulation of a multistate control optimization problem, which is tackled in this paper. This paper enhances the accuracy of the existing MMC state-space model by including the following: 1) a piecewise affine insulated-gate bipolar transistor/diode model and 2) the impact of dead time. This paper also proposes a simulation-based gradient-descent optimization algorithm (cosimulation) to optimize the controller gains, given the controller type/form and the reference state trajectory. The theoretical proofs of the gradients required in the optimization algorithm are also provided. The aforementioned optimization algorithm is applied to a variable-frequency MMC-based drive system. Experimental results on a scaled-down prototype and simulation results on a real-world application are provided to validate the accuracy of the proposed MMC model and to show the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2472519","startPage":"102","endPage":"112","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7352402/07222429.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2472519","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352402","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation-Based Gradient-Descent Optimization of Modular Multilevel Converter Controller Parameters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Voltage control","Switches","Voltage measurement","State-space methods","Insulated gate bipolar transistors","Lyapunov methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Modular multilevel converter (MMC)","multistate control optimization","hybrid system","gradient-descent","Lyapunov theory","singularly perturbed systems","stability"]},{"kwd":["Gradient descent","hybrid system","Lyapunov theory","modular multilevel converter (MMC)","multistate control optimization","singularly perturbed systems","stability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222429/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Simulation-Based Gradient-Descent Optimization of Modular Multilevel Converter Controller Parameters","volume":"63","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7222429/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1443814"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-14-1-0615"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation-Based Gradient-Descent Optimization of Modular Multilevel Converter Controller Parameters","sourcePdf":"tie-debnath-2472519-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123354S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7352402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7352402","articleId":"7222429","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7222430,"authors":[{"name":"Yunpeng Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7384789/7222430/wang-2464314-small.gif","p":["Yunpeng Wang received the B.S. degree in information and computing science from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2015.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Beijing Institute of Control Engineering, Beijing.

The desired formation is described by the shape theory. This theory can generate a set of feasible formations that share the same relative relation among robots. An optimal formation means that finding one formation from the feasible formation set, which has the minimum distance to the initial formation of the multirobot system. Then, the formation problem is transformed into an optimization problem. In addition, the orientation, scale, and admissible range of the formation can also be considered as the constraints in the optimization problem. Furthermore, if all robots are identical, their positions in the system are exchangeable. Then, each robot does not necessarily move to one specific position in the formation. In this case, the optimal formation problem becomes a combinational optimization problem, whose optimal solution is very hard to obtain. Inspired by the penalty method, this combinational optimization problem can be approximately transformed into a convex optimization problem. Due to the involvement of the Euclidean norm in the distance, the objective function of these optimization problems are nonsmooth. To solve these nonsmooth optimization problems efficiently, a recurrent neural network approach is employed, owing to its parallel computation ability. Finally, some simulations and experiments are given to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed optimal formation approach.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2464314","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7384789/07222430.pdf","startPage":"322","endPage":"333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2464314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Formation of Multirobot Systems Based on a Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Formation of Multirobot Systems Based on a Recurrent Neural Network","volume":"27","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15721755","pubMedId":"26316224","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222430/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222430/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370032, 61422310, 61375102, 61225017 and 61421004"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z121101002512066"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Formation of Multirobot Systems Based on a Recurrent Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tnnls-cheng-2464314-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185481S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7384789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"7384789","articleId":"7222430","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7222433,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, due to their cost and risks relating to the security of supply, alternative solutions such as ferrite magnets have recently become popular. In this paper, the two major design challenges of using ferrite magnets for a high-torque-density and high-speed application, i.e., their low remanent flux density and low coercivity, are addressed. It is shown that a spoke-type design utilizing a distributed winding may overcome the torque density challenge due to a simultaneous flux concentration and a reluctance torque possibility. Furthermore, the demagnetization challenge can be overcome through the careful optimization of the rotor structure, with the inclusion of nonmagnetic voids on the top and bottom of the magnets. To meet the challenges of a high-speed operation, an extensive rotor structural analysis has been undertaken, during which electromagnetics and manufacturing tolerances are taken into account. Electromagnetic studies are validated through the testing of a prototype, which is custom built for static torque and demagnetization evaluation. The disclosed motor design surpasses the state-of-the-art performance and cost, merging the theories into a multidisciplinary product.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222433/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","volume":"63","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222433/","dateOfInsertion":"10 December 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High-Performance Low-Cost Electric Motor for Electric Vehicles Using Ferrite Magnets","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Innovate U.K.","grantNumber":"110130"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Performance Low-Cost Electric Motor for Electric Vehicles Using Ferrite Magnets","sourcePdf":"tie-kimiabeigi-2472517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079232S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7352402","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7352402","articleId":"7222433","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7222436,"authors":[{"name":"Arya Mazumdar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Arya Mazumdar (S\u201905\u2013M\u201913) is an assistant professor in University of Minnesota-Twin Cities (UMN).

Unlike the usual local recovery model of codes for distributed storage, this model accounts for the fact that each server or storage node in a network is connectable to only some, and not all other, nodes. This may happen for reasons such as physical separation, inhomogeneity in storage platforms, and so forth. We estimate the storage capacity of both undirected and directed networks under this model and propose some constructive schemes. From a coding theory point of view, we show that this model is approximately dual of the well-studied index coding problem. Furthermore, in this paper, we extend the above model to handle multiple server failures. Among other results, we provide an upper bound on the minimum pairwise distance of a set of words that can be stored in a graph with the local repair guarantee. The well-known impossibility bounds on the distance of locally recoverable codes follow from our result.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299738","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7299738/07222436.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2472521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2472521","startPage":"5810","endPage":"5821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Storage Capacity of Repairable Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222436/","displayDocTitle":"Storage Capacity of Repairable Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222436/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"15524616","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000143","fundingName":"National Science Foundation CAREER Award","grantNumber":"CCF 1453121"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Storage Capacity of Repairable Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-mazumdar-2472521-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138079S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7299738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7299738","articleId":"7222436","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-03"},{"_id":7222438,"authors":[{"name":"Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez-Ortiz","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Engineering, Loyola University Andaluc\u00eda, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7543555/7222438/perez-2461436-small.gif","p":["Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez-Ortiz was born in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain.

One common approach oversamples the minority class through convex combination of its patterns. We explore the general idea of synthetic oversampling in the feature space induced by a kernel function (as opposed to input space). If the kernel function matches the underlying problem, the classes will be linearly separable and synthetically generated patterns will lie on the minority class region. Since the feature space is not directly accessible, we use the empirical feature space (EFS) (a Euclidean space isomorphic to the feature space) for oversampling purposes. The proposed method is framed in the context of support vector machines, where the imbalanced data sets can pose a serious hindrance. The idea is investigated in three scenarios: 1) oversampling in the full and reduced-rank EFSs; 2) a kernel learning technique maximizing the data class separation to study the influence of the feature space structure (implicitly defined by the kernel function); and 3) a unified framework for preferential oversampling that spans some of the previous approaches in the literature. We support our investigation with extensive experiments over 50 imbalanced data sets.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222438/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7222438/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231716","pubMedId":"26316222","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Oversampling the Minority Class in the Feature Space","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TIN2014-54583-C2-1-R project through the Spanish Ministrial Commission of Science and Technology within the European fund for regional development"},{"fundingName":"P11-TIC-7508 project of the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda, Spain"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/L000296/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oversampling the Minority Class in the Feature Space","sourcePdf":"tnnls-perezortiz-2461436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109509S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7543555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7543555","articleId":"7222438","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7222448,"authors":[{"name":"Yang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China","College of Mathematics, Physics and Information Engineering, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Liu","id":"37598250300"},{"name":"Liangjie Sun","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, China"],"firstName":"Liangjie","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085859200"},{"name":"Jianquan Lu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jianquan","lastName":"Lu","id":"37597286200"},{"name":"Jinling Liang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Jinling","lastName":"Liang","id":"37406930100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-237X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2388"}],"articleNumber":"7222448","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":97,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":689},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Synchronization","Limit-cycles","Adaptive control","Algorithm design and analysis","Learning systems","Biology","Oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology","Boolean functions","control system synthesis","feedback","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback controller design","synchronization","Boolean control networks","necessary conditions","sufficient conditions","algebraic representations","logical dynamics","master BCN","slave BCN","biology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Boolean control network","semitensor product (STP)","state-feedback control","synchronization"]}],"abstract":"This brief investigates the partial and complete synchronization of two Boolean control networks (BCNs).

The proposed design is formulated as minimizing the power consumption of FD-BS under different signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) constraints. Semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is used to convert the initial nonconvex optimization to be a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. Then the optimality of SDR is strictly proved by showing the existence of the rank-one optimal solutions. To reduce the computational complexity, we develop zero forcing beamforming-based suboptimal algorithms, where the solutions can be obtained using golden search and closed-form solutions can be derived in each step. Simulation results are then provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2472527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2472527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07222458.pdf","startPage":"329","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Physical-Layer Security for Full Duplex Communications With Self-Interference Mitigation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Physical-Layer Security for Full Duplex Communications With Self-Interference Mitigation","volume":"15","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222458/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697414","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222458/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB336600 and 2012CB316102"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422109 and 61531011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4131003"},{"fundingName":"Huawei Innovation Research Program","grantNumber":"YB2013030012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Physical-Layer Security for Full Duplex Communications With Self-Interference Mitigation","sourcePdf":"twc-zhu-2472527-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.194332S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7222458","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7222461,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Dini","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic, and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7222461/dini-small.gif","p":["Michele Dini received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical\n engineering and the Ph.D. degree in information technologies from the University of Bologna, Cesena, Italy, in 2008,\n 2011, and 2015, respectively.","Since 2012, he has been with the Advanced Research Center on Electronic Systems and at the Department of Electrical,\n Electronic, and Information Engineering, University of Bologna.

It is hence expected that \u21131-regularized channel estimation methods can improve channel estimation performance in the broadband wireless channels. However, it is well-known that the \u21132 multiburst (MB) channel estimation achieves the Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (CRB) asymptotically. This is because the \u21132 MB technique formulated as a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) problem improves the mean squared error (MSE) performance by utilizing the subspace projection. Performance analysis shows that \u21131-regularized channel estimation does not improve the MSE performance significantly over the \u21132 MB technique so far as the subspace channel model assumption is correct. We demonstrate, however, a receiver with \u21131-regularized channel estimation can improve bit error rate (BER) performance if the assumption is not always correct. For this purpose, we focus on intermittent transmission (TX) scenario which is defined as a generalized TX sequence having arbitrary length interruption between two continuous TX bursts. A receiver with the \u21132 MB method suffers from BER deterioration in an intermittent TX scenario having abrupt channel changes. As a solution to the problem, we propose a new algorithm which is a hybrid of \u21131-regularized least square (LS) and \u21132 MMSE channel estimation techniques. Simulation results show that the receiver with the proposed algorithm achieves a significant BER gain over that of the \u21132 MB technique in the intermittent TX scenario.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2472418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07222465.pdf","endPage":"328","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"\u21131 LS and \u21132 MMSE-Based Hybrid Channel Estimation for Intermittent Wireless Connections","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2472418","startPage":"314","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222465","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"\u21131 LS and \u21132 MMSE-Based Hybrid Channel Estimation for Intermittent Wireless Connections","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222465/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15697413","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7222465/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JAIST and University of Oulu"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"\u21131 LS and \u21132 MMSE-Based Hybrid Channel Estimation for Intermittent Wireless Connections","sourcePdf":"twc-takano-2472418-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106901S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7222465","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7222469,"authors":[{"name":"Qimei Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7222469/chen-2472558-small.gif","p":["Qimei Chen received the B.S.E. degree from Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, in 2012.

In this paper, we investigate joint user association and resource allocation for MSCA systems to achieve energy efficiency (EE) balance among different BSs. We aim at maximizing the weighted summation of EE values for different BSs, which is modeled as a nonconvex combinatorial sum-of-ratios optimization problem. To develop an upper bound algorithm, we first relax the combinatorial variables and then transform the problem into a series of convex optimization problems by the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. We also propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm, which divides the original optimization problem into two steps: user association and channel allocation, as well as power allocation. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms can achieve flexible EE tradeoff among BSs, and the EE can be significantly improved with MSCA.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07222469.pdf","startPage":"6366","endPage":"6376","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2472558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2472558","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient User Association and Resource Allocation for Multistream Carrier Aggregation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optimization","Linear programming","Transforms","Approximation methods","Joints","Convex functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","channel allocation","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient user association","resource allocation","multistream carrier aggregation","base stations","energy efficiency","nonconvex combinatorial sum-of-ratios optimization","convex optimization problems","successive convex approximation","low-complexity suboptimal algorithm","channel allocation","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy efficiency (EE)","multistream carrier aggregation (MSCA)","resource allocation","successive convex approximation (SCA)","sum-of-ratios programming","user association"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient User Association and Resource Allocation for Multistream Carrier Aggregation","volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7222469/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210024","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY14F010011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301143"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Key Lab of Data Storage and Transmission Technology","grantNumber":"201307"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient User Association and Resource Allocation for Multistream Carrier Aggregation","sourcePdf":"tvt-yu-2472558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138646S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7222469","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7222473,"authors":[{"name":"Zhicheng Dong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Information Coding and Transmission, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7222473/dong-2472989-small.gif","p":["Zhicheng Dong (SM'12) was born in Langzhong, China, in 1982.

The closed-form expressions for rate and capacity with perfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect CSI are derived. In this paper, imperfect CSI is caused jointly by channel estimation error and unavoidable delay between when CSI is estimated and when the estimation results are used for actual transmission. The capacity with perfect CSI is just a special case of imperfect CSI. Based on the closed-form expressions of the maximum capacity, optimal RSBA algorithms with perfect and imperfect CSI are proposed, respectively. Theoretical and numerical results show that the RSBA scheme can improve the system performance effectively under the perfect-CSI case. It can make a tradeoff between intercarrier interference (ICI) and transmission efficiency by considering the cyclic prefix. The results also show that the RSBA scheme is effective in repelling the impact of outdated CSI, as well as in reducing the impact of channel estimation error, but to a lesser extent.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2472989","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07222473.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2472989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","startPage":"6038","endPage":"6050","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Spectral Efficiency of Rate and Subcarrier Bandwidth Adaptive OFDM Systems Over Very Fast Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Spectral Efficiency of Rate and Subcarrier Bandwidth Adaptive OFDM Systems Over Very Fast Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222473/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210027","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7222473/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316100"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61561046/61501382"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"111-2-14"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"SWJTU12ZT02/2682014ZT11"},{"fundingName":"Key Project of Science Foundation of Tibet Autonomous Region","grantNumber":"2015ZR-14-3"},{"fundingName":"2015 Outstanding Youth Scholars of Everest Scholars Talent Development Support Program of Tibet University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Spectral Efficiency of Rate and Subcarrier Bandwidth Adaptive OFDM Systems Over Very Fast Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-dong-2472989-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104818S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7222473","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7222474,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiliang Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7222474/zhang-small.gif","p":["Zhiliang Zhang (S\u201903\u2013M\u201909\u2013SM\u201914)\n received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and\n Astronautics (NUAA), Nanjing, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of\n Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada, in 2009.","In June, 2009, he joined NUAA and he is a Professor at Aero-Power Sci-Tech Center.

Moreover, a novel structure of the PCB embedded inductors is introduced and the comparison among the discrete inductor, the planar spiral inductor and the four-layered solenoid PCB inductor is given in terms of the loss. A 15 V input, 25 W/28 V output/30 MHz SEPIC converter was built to verify the proposed design method and the benefit of the new structure of the PCB embedded inductors. The power density of the power stage is realized over 200 W/in\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n and the efficiency is 82.5% at the rated output. The temperature of the proposed PCB embedded inductor is reduced from 102.6 \u00b0C (the discrete inductor) to 64.8 \u00b0C (a reduction of 37%) and the efficiency is improved 2% over the discrete solution at the full load.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rectifiers","Inductors","Design methodology","Topology","Density measurement","Power system measurements","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["duality (mathematics)","inductors","resonant power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant SEPIC converter","rectifier stage","circuit duality theory","loss analysis","PCB embedded inductors","discrete inductor","planar spiral inductor","four-layered solenoid PCB inductor","frequency 30 MHz","voltage 15 V","power 25 W","voltage 28 V","efficiency 82.5 percent","temperature 102.6 C","temperature 64.8 C"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Very High Frequency","resonant dc-dc converter","SEPIC converter","resonant gate driver","PCB inductors","air core inductor","class E inverter","resonant rectifier"]},{"kwd":["Air core inductor","class E inverter","PCB inductors","resonant dc\u2013dc converter","resonant gate driver","resonant rectifier","SEPIC converter","very high frequency"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2472479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7374779/07222474.pdf","startPage":"4536","endPage":"4548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2472479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Decoupling Design of a 30 MHz Resonant SEPIC Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222474","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Decoupling Design of a 30 MHz Resonant SEPIC Converter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222474/","volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222474/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697295","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (NUAA)","grantNumber":"NE2014101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Decoupling Design of a 30 MHz Resonant SEPIC Converter","sourcePdf":"tpel-zhang-2472479-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174272S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7374779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7374779","articleId":"7222474","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7222475,"authors":[{"name":"Syuan-Li Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7222475/lin-2472455-small.gif","p":["\n\nSyuan-Li Lin received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from \nYuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan, in 2011 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung \nUniversity, Tainan, Taiwan, in 2013.","Since 2013, he has been an Engineer with EDIMAX Technology Company, Ltd., Taiwan.

These converters are used either in combinations of series/parallel connections or as stand-alone devices. A lot of work has taken place in the stability analysis of these converters and several methods have been used/proposed with different properties, strengths and weaknesses. Describing all existing methods is probably a never ending task and therefore in this tutorial paper four different methods will be presented by pointing out their main properties and explaining briefly how they can be used in applications that involve power converters. More specifically, the chosen methods are based on 1) the Poincar\u00e9 map, 2) Saltation matrix, 3) trajectory sensitivity, and 4) steady-state-response analysis of the discrete-time model. Simple case studies from previous publications are collected and presented in order to further explain these methodologies. Finally, this paper intents to describe some of the future challenges that exist in the area of stability analysis of power converters especially when these are employed in distributed generation applications.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/7247780/07222477.pdf","startPage":"302","endPage":"315","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2462013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2015.2462013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222477","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Review on Stability Analysis Methods for Switching Mode Power Converters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bifurcation","Stability analysis","Switches","Orbits","Jacobian matrices","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Matrix converters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","discrete time systems","distributed power generation","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis method","switching mode power converters","distributed power generation system","DC-DC power converters","Poincare map","Saltation matrix","trajectory sensitivity","steady-state-response analysis","discrete-time model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DC-DC converters","distributed power systems","Poincar\u00e9 map","Saltation matrix","stability analysis","steady state analysis","trajectory sensitivity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222477/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Review on Stability Analysis Methods for Switching Mode Power Converters","volume":"5","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7222477/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15433143","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Review on Stability Analysis Methods for Switching Mode Power Converters","sourcePdf":"jetcas-elaroudi-2462013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.161899S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"7247780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7247780","articleId":"7222477","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7222478,"authors":[{"name":"Yajuan Guan","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7222478/Yajuan-small.gif","p":["Yajuan Guan (S\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, Hebei, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively.

The proposed controller provides faster response and better accuracy in contrast to the conventional droop control, since this novel approach does not require any active or reactive power calculations. Instead, a synchronous-reference-frame (SRF) virtual impedance loop and an SRF-based phase-locked loop are used. Stationary analysis is provided in order to identify the inherent mechanism of the direct and quadrature output currents in relation to the voltage amplitude and frequency with different line impedances by means of the system transfer functions. Comparison experiments from two parallel inverters are presented to compare the control performance of the conventional droop control and the proposed control with different line impedances. In addition, experimental results from a setup with three parallel 2.2-kW inverters verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy in different scenarios.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7374779/07222478.pdf","startPage":"4576","endPage":"4593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2472279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2472279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374779","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Way of Controlling Parallel-Connected Inverters by Using Synchronous-Reference-Frame Virtual Impedance Loop\u2014Part I: Control Principle","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Impedance","Voltage control","Reactive power","Phase locked loops","Frequency control","Resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric current control","invertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel onnected inverter control","synchronous reference rame virtual impedance loop","autonomous current sharing control","three hase inverter","phase locked loop","voltage amplitude","droop control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parallel inverters","synchronous reference frame","phase-locked loop","virtual impedance","droop control"]},{"kwd":["Droop control","parallel inverters","phase-locked loop (PLL)","synchronous reference frame","virtual impedance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222478/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A New Way of Controlling Parallel-Connected Inverters by Using Synchronous-Reference-Frame Virtual Impedance Loop\u2014Part I: Control Principle","volume":"31","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7222478/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15697305","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Way of Controlling Parallel-Connected Inverters by Using Synchronous-Reference-Frame Virtual Impedance Loop\u2014Part I: Control Principle","sourcePdf":"tpel-guan-2472279-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111548S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7374779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7374779","articleId":"7222478","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7222480,"authors":[{"name":"Yanxiang Jiang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7222480/jiang-2472995-small.gif","p":["\n\nYanxiang Jiang (S'03\u2013M'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical \nengineering from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 1999 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communications and \ninformation systems from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.","From December 2013 to December 2014, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Signals and Information Group, Department of \nElectrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD, USA, with Prof. K.

The resource and power are optimized for maximization of the energy efficiency (EE) of D2D communications. Exploiting the properties of fractional programming, we transform the original nonconvex optimization problem in fractional form into an equivalent optimization problem in subtractive form. Then, an efficient iterative resource allocation and power control scheme is proposed. In each iteration, part of the constraints of the EE optimization problem are removed by exploiting the penalty function approach. We further propose a novel two-layer approach, which allows finding the optimum at each iteration by decoupling the EE optimization problem of joint resource allocation and power control into two separate steps. In the first layer, the optimal power values are obtained by solving a series of maximization problems through root finding, with or without considering the loss of cellular users' rates. In the second layer, the formulated optimization problem belongs to a classical resource-allocation problem with single allocation format, which admits a network flow formulation so that it can be solved to optimality. Simulation results demonstrate the remarkable improvements in terms of EE by using the proposed iterative resource allocation and power control scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2472995","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07222480.pdf","startPage":"6119","endPage":"6127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2472995","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Joint Resource Allocation and Power Control for D2D Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222480/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Joint Resource Allocation and Power Control for D2D Communications","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16209983","htmlLink":"/document/7222480/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316004"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech 863 Program","grantNumber":"2015AA01A709"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61221002"},{"fundingName":"National Key Project","grantNumber":"2012ZX03003013-004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Joint Resource Allocation and Power Control for D2D Communications","sourcePdf":"tvt-jiang-2472995-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08474S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"137","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7222480","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7222487,"authors":[{"name":"Anming Dong","affiliation":["Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Wireless Communication Technologies, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7222487/dong-2472463-small.gif","p":["Anming Dong (S'11) received the B.E. degree in electronic information science and technology from Liaocheng University, Liaocheng, China, in 2004 and the M.E. degree in communication and information systems from Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, China, in 2007.

The formulated Min-Max MSE optimization problem is not jointly convex on the transmit precoders and receive filters and, thus, is very difficult to solve directly. An iterative method is proposed to solve the optimization problem to get a suboptimal solution instead. Considering that if the receive filters are fixed, the Min-Max MSE problem can be reformulated as a second-order cone programming problem, and if the transmit precoders are fixed, the closed-form receive filters minimizing the receive MSE can be easily obtained, and the formulated Min-Max MSE problem is solved by alternatively optimizing the transmit precoders and the receive filters. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved, which shows its feasibility. Furthermore, a robust Min-Max MSE algorithm is proposed to counter the channel uncertainty. Simulation results show that the proposed Min-Max MSE algorithm can achieve IA when the antennas are configured to be strong IA proper and when the users in the network are of the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Analysis indicates that the proposed Min-Max IA transceiver design scheme can significantly improve user fairness with a possible cost of sum-rate reduction. Results also show that the proposed robust design algorithm provides better performance when lacking perfect channel state information (CSI).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference Alignment Transceiver Design by Minimizing the Maximum Mean Square Error for MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channel","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2472463","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07222487.pdf","startPage":"6024","endPage":"6037","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2472463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222487/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Interference Alignment Transceiver Design by Minimizing the Maximum Mean Square Error for MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channel","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7222487/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16209975","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"International S&T Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2014DFA11640"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61371109 and 61271229"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M551906"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference Alignment Transceiver Design by Minimizing the Maximum Mean Square Error for MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channel","sourcePdf":"tvt-zhang-2472463-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099145S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7222487","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7222488,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Li","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7544544/7222488/7222488-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rui Li received the M.S. degree from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2012, both in computer science.","He is currently an Associate Professor with Dongguan University of Technology, Dongguan, China.

This paper is concerned with the problem of privacy-preserving range query processing on clouds. Prior schemes are weak in privacy protection as they cannot achieve index indistinguishability, and therefore allow the cloud to statistically estimate the values of data and queries using domain knowledge and history query results. In this paper, we propose the first range query processing scheme that achieves index indistinguishability under the indistinguishability against chosen keyword attack (IND-CKA). Our key idea is to organize indexing elements in a complete binary tree called PBtree, which satisfies structure indistinguishability (i.e., two sets of data items have the same PBtree structure if and only if the two sets have the same number of data items) and node indistinguishability (i.e., the values of PBtree nodes are completely random and have no statistical meaning). We prove that our scheme is secure under the widely adopted IND-CKA security model. We propose two algorithms, namely PBtree traversal width minimization and PBtree traversal depth minimization, to improve query processing efficiency. We prove that the worst-case complexity of our query processing algorithm using PBtree is O(|R|logn), where n is the total number of data items and R is the set of data items in the query result. We implemented and evaluated our scheme on a real-world dataset with 5 million items. For example, for a query whose results contain 10 data items, it takes only 0.17 ms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231763","htmlLink":"/document/7222488/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 August 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fast and Scalable Range Query Processing With Strong Privacy Protection for Cloud Computing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370226, 61472184, 61321491 and 61272546"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1017598"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast and Scalable Range Query Processing With Strong Privacy Protection for Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tnet-liu-2457493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10132S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7544544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7544544","articleId":"7222488","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7222491,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Liu","affiliation":["University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Minhang, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7222491/liu-small.gif","p":["Ming Liu (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree from SiChuan\n University, Sichuan, China, in 2007, and the M.S. degree from the University of Science and Technology Beijing,\n Beijing, China, in 2011, both in mechatronic engineering.

This paper reports new results on optimized parameter design of a MHz WPT system based on the analytical derivation of a Class E current-driven rectifier. The input impedance of the Class E rectifier is accurately derived, for the first time, considering the on-resistance of the diode and the equivalent series resistance of the filter inductor. This derived input impedance is then used to develop and guide design procedures that determine the optimal parameters of the rectifier, coupling coils, and a Class E PA in an example 6.78-MHz WPT system. Furthermore, the efficiencies of these three components and the overall WPT system are also analytically derived for design and evaluation purposes. In the final experiments, the analytical results are found to well match the experimental results. With loosely coupled coils (mutual inductance coefficient $k$ =0.1327), the experimental 6.78-MHz WPT system can achieve 84% efficiency at a power level of 20 Watts.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2472565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7374779/07222491.pdf","startPage":"4280","endPage":"4291","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2472565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374779","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameter Design for a 6.78-MHz Wireless Power Transfer System Based on Analytical Derivation of Class E Current-Driven Rectifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"25 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222491/","displayDocTitle":"Parameter Design for a 6.78-MHz Wireless Power Transfer System Based on Analytical Derivation of Class E Current-Driven Rectifier","volume":"31","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15697313","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222491/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter Design for a 6.78-MHz Wireless Power Transfer System Based on Analytical Derivation of Class E Current-Driven Rectifier","sourcePdf":"tpel-ma-2472565-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088612S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7374779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"7374779","articleId":"7222491","onlineDate":"25 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7222529,"authors":[{"name":"Mariapaola D'Imperio","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics, Department of Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Mariapaola","lastName":"D'Imperio","id":"37085381441"},{"name":"Luca Carbonari","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics, Department of Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Carbonari","id":"37085344762"},{"name":"Nahian Rahman","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics, Department of Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Nahian","lastName":"Rahman","id":"37085616390"},{"name":"Carlo Canali","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics, Department of Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlo","lastName":"Canali","id":"37085376637"},{"name":"Ferdinando Cannella","affiliation":["Advanced Robotics, Department of Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Genoa, Italy"],"firstName":"Ferdinando","lastName":"Cannella","id":"37681701900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9107-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9106-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"7222529","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"abstract":"The modular and self-reconfigurable mechanisms are arising the interest of the robotics research community for their peculiarities of flexibility and cost effectiveness.

To formulate a beneficial relationship between driver and vehicle, it is important to analyze how the drivers would react to autonomous vehicles compared to human-driven (conventional) vehicles. In this study, we focused on analyzing individual driving experience in several road conditions for autonomous and conventional vehicles among experienced and novice drivers. We first developed a simplified driving simulator that can connect arbitrary interfaces, create virtual environments consisting of scenarios and events that drivers encounter in real-world driving, and implement fully autonomous driving. We then conducted experiments to clarify differences of driving experiences for autonomous driving between the two groups. The experimental results showed that experienced drivers opt for conventional driving mainly due to the flexibility and driving fun it offers, while novices tend to prefer autonomous driving due to its inherent easiness and safety. An in-depth analysis indicated that drivers preferred to use both the driving methods interchangeably depending on the road and traffic conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222548/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15403042","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222548/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analysis of individual driving experience in autonomous and human-driven vehicles using a driving simulator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of individual driving experience in autonomous and human-driven vehicles using a driving simulator","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045813S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190945","isNumber":"7222494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190945","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7222494","articleId":"7222548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7222560,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Masoud Namazi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran","Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Kyungsung university, busan, korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad Masoud","lastName":"Namazi","id":"38324013300"},{"name":"Mojtaba Mansouri Borujeni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba Mansouri","lastName":"Borujeni","id":"37085538117"},{"name":"Amir Rashidi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran","Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Kyungsung university, busan, korea"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Rashidi","id":"38295483200"},{"name":"Sayed Morteza Saghaeian Nejad","affiliation":["Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Isfahan, IR"],"firstName":"Sayed Morteza Saghaeian","lastName":"Nejad"},{"name":"Jin-Woo Ahn","affiliation":["Department of Mechatronics Engineering, Kyungsung university, busan, korea"],"firstName":"Jin-Woo","lastName":"Ahn","id":"37308875000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9107-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9106-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"7222560","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque","Reluctance motors","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization","Rotors","Hysteresis motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive systems","electric current control","hysteresis","machine control","optimal control","particle swarm optimisation","reluctance motor drives","switching systems (control)","torque control","variable structure systems","velocity control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["torque ripple reduction","switched reluctance motor drive","adaptive sliding mode control","optimal speed controller","elitist-mutated multiobjective particle swarm optimization EM-MOPSO","current command","hysteresis current controller","trial-and-error process","integrals squared error","ISE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM)","Speed control","Torque Ripple Minimization","Elitist-Mutated Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (EM-MOPSO)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, for speed control with torque ripple minimization of switched reluctance motor drives an optimal speed controller based on Elitist-Mutated Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (EM-MOPSO) with good accuracies, and performances is presented. The control mechanism is composed of an adaptive sliding mode speed controller to determine the appropriate current command and a hysteresis current controller. In the adaptive sliding mode controller, the heuristic parameters are usually determined by a tedious and repetitive trial-and-error process. By using EM-MOPSO, the trial-and error process is eliminated.

Unlike conventional motors capable of controlling a single DOF motion only, a SWM is able to provide 3-DOF rotational motions. However, it is challenging to measure the three highly-coupled rotational motions in real time. Unlike some previous sensing systems using optical encoders to measure rotation along each axis separately, a contact-less sensing system such as one composed of Hall Effect sensors is preferred, so as to avoid friction and additional moment inertia, which may damage dynamic performance. In this paper, a sensing system based on a combination of magnetic sensors is proposed, and neural networks are applied to compute rotational angles from measured magnetic field. The paper is organized as followings: distributed multi-pole model (DMP) to obtain the SWM magnetic field distribution (MFD) is demonstrated first; important factors affecting measuring accuracy is researched by simulation then; experimental investigations for a SWM rotor are presented; finally, possible methods to improve proposed sensing system are proposed.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2015.7222738","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190945/7222494/07222738.pdf","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1414","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2015.7222738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7222494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a sensing system for a spherical motor based on Hall Effect sensors and neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222738/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of a sensing system for a spherical motor based on Hall Effect sensors and neural networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15403066","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7222738/","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a sensing system for a spherical motor based on Hall Effect sensors and neural networks","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094373S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190945","isNumber":"7222494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190945","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7222494","articleId":"7222738","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7222741,"authors":[{"name":"Ting-Ying Wu","affiliation":["A*STAR Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech), Singapore"],"firstName":"Ting-Ying","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085673611"},{"name":"Chow Yin Lai","affiliation":["A*STAR Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech), Singapore"],"firstName":"Chow Yin","lastName":"Lai","id":"37086306071"},{"name":"Silu Chen","affiliation":["A *STAR Singapore Institute of Manufacturing Technology (SIMTech), Singapore"],"firstName":"Silu","lastName":"Chen","id":"37833026100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9107-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9106-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"7222741","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":156},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222741","abstract":"In this paper, an adaptive neural network compensator is proposed to improve the control performance of a macro-mini robotic manipulator, whereby an end effector called the mini manipulator is mounted at the end of an industrial robot called the macro manipulator in robotic literature. With the macro-mini architecture, the manipulator has the advantages of a large workspace due to the industrial robot, as well as fast dynamic response and diverse functions due to the end effector with optimized mechanical design. However, the coupling dynamics between two separated systems will also influence the control performance, especially at the end effector. An adaptive neural network compensator is added to the mini's original control system, and it can estimate and eliminate the dynamic coupling effect coming from the macro system in real-time in an on-line manner. Simulation shows that even if the model of the macro is unknown and its controller unchanged, in the presence of external disturbance at macro manipulator, the dynamic coupling effect can be almost eliminated in both position and force controls by the appended adaptive neural network compensator. Experimental results also demonstrate that as compared to the mini based on feedback linearization with the PID controller, vibration at the end point due to the coupling effect can be obviously suppressed using the adaptive compensator, and the steady state error is also gradually improved.","doi":"10.1109/AIM.2015.7222741","startPage":"1427","endPage":"1432","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190945/7222494/07222741.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Advanced Intelligent Mechatronics (AIM)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/AIM.2015.7222741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7222494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive neural network compensator for decoupling of dynamic effects of a macro-mini manipulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulator dynamics","Couplings","Artificial neural networks","Force"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design engineering","end effectors","feedback","industrial robots","linearisation techniques","neurocontrollers","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural network compensator","macro-mini robotic manipulator","end effector","industrial robot","optimized mechanical design","feedback linearization","PID controller","steady state error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive neural network compensator for decoupling of dynamic effects of a macro-mini manipulator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222741/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15403267","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive neural network compensator for decoupling of dynamic effects of a macro-mini manipulator","confLoc":"Busan, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0131.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085009S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190945","isNumber":"7222494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190945","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7222494","articleId":"7222741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7222760,"authors":[{"name":"Ko-Yuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ko-Yuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085652312"},{"name":"Pei-Hsuan Lee","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Pei-Hsuan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085648325"},{"name":"Shao-Kang Hung","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shao-Kang","lastName":"Hung","id":"37276485500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9107-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9106-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6247"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-6255"}],"articleNumber":"7222760","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Payloads","Batteries","Underwater cables","Unmanned aerial vehicles","Propellers","Cameras","Data acquisition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace propulsion","autonomous aerial vehicles","cables (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimum electric cable selection","kite-like unmanned aerial vehicle","taut tether","electric power","ground battery","payload model","kite-like UAV","electrical characteristics measurement","mechanical characteristics measurement","UAV propulsion unit","maximum payload capacity","flying altitude"]}],"abstract":"A kite-like unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is leashed by a taut tether, which supplies electric power from the ground battery.

Many sensors have been used as information source for guessing human activity, such as accelerometers, video cameras, etc., but recently the availability of a sophisticated sensor designed specifically for tracking humans, as is the Microsoft Kinect has opened new opportunities. The aim of this paper is to determine some human activities, such as eating, reading, drinking, etc., while the person is seated, using the Kinect skeleton structure as input. In this paper we take an unsupervised approach based on K-means for clustering activities, and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to recognize the activities captured with the Microsoft Kinect's skeleton tracking feature. We show also how the number of clusters affects the performance of the HMM, and that after reaching a certain number of clusters, the performance of the HMM models to recognize activities does not improve anymore.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognizing Activities Using a Kinect Skeleton Tracking and Hidden Markov Models","publicationTitle":"2014 13th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/MICAI.2014.18","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 13th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222492/7222827/07222846.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MICAI.2014.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7222827","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7222846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7222846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-22 Nov. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Recognizing Activities Using a Kinect Skeleton Tracking and Hidden Markov Models","conferenceDate":"16-22 Nov. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7222846/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"15413297","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognizing Activities Using a Kinect Skeleton Tracking and Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Tuxtla Gutierrez, Mexico","sourcePdf":"9900a082.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070781S","chronDate":"16-22 Nov. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7222492","isNumber":"7222827","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222492","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7222827","articleId":"7222846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7222849,"authors":[{"name":"Israel Tabarez Paz","affiliation":["Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica del Valle de Toluca","Universidad Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de M\u00e9xico, Atizap\u00e1n de Zaragoza, M\u00e9xico"],"firstName":"Israel Tabarez","lastName":"Paz","id":"37085652039"},{"name":"Neil Hern\u00e1ndez Gress","affiliation":["Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey"],"firstName":"Neil Hern\u00e1ndez","lastName":"Gress","id":"38256656200"},{"name":"Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez Mendoza","affiliation":["Tecnol\u00f3gico de Monterrey, Atizap\u00e1n de Zaragora"],"firstName":"Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez","lastName":"Mendoza","id":"38256367800"},{"name":"David Gonz\u00e1lez Marr\u00f3n","affiliation":["Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Pachuca, Pachuca, Hidalgo"],"firstName":"David Gonz\u00e1lez","lastName":"Marr\u00f3n","id":"37085653935"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9900-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7010-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7222849","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Neurons","Neural networks","Acceleration","Parallel processing","Databases","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graphics processing units","neural chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiclass simulation scalability","spiking neural networks","SNN algorithm","GPUs devices Ge Force 9400M","Ge Force650 GTX","multiclass database","learning time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["GPUs","Spikin Neural Networks","Classification","Multiclass"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scalability of Multiclass Simulation of Spiking Neural Networks on GPUs","abstract":"This manuscript is focused on scalability of Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for acceleration of its learning time.

Recently, a new concept to deal with this higher frequency instability, the active damper, has been proposed. The active damper is a power electronics based power device, which provides an adjustable damping capability to the power system where the voltage harmonic instability is measured. It can stabilize by adjusting the equivalent node impedance with its plug and play feature. This feature gives many degrees of freedom of its installation point when the system has many nodes. Therefore, this paper addresses the proper placement of an active damper in an unstable small-scale power distribution system. A time-domain model of the Cigre benchmark low-vltage network is used as a test field. The result shows the active damper location is important for stabilizing the overall network and the active damper should be placed near to the problematic power devices. Finally, the unstable network with five inverters is able to obtain stability by adopting an active damper to the place where its ability becomes the most effective.","doi":"10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223025","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180539/7223003/07223025.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Site selection of active damper for stabilizing power electronics based power distribution system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Site selection of active damper for stabilizing power electronics based power distribution system","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7223025/","accessionNumber":"15402784","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223025/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Site selection of active damper for stabilizing power electronics based power distribution system","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"099.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053813S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180539","isNumber":"7223003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180539","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7223003","articleId":"7223025","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7223028,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In particular, a precise estimation of State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) parameters strongly affects the full exploitation of battery energy potential in real applications. In this paper a novel real-time estimation method is presented representing a good tradeoff between model accuracy and algorithm complexity. In the proposed approach, SOC and SOH values are determined by a suitable algorithm that continuously performs a comparison between the ESS voltage value, calculated by an adaptive run-time circuital model, and its real value measured at the ESS terminals. The result of such comparison is used to suitably tune two parameters of the ESS circuital model, the no-load voltage and resistive voltage drop, in order to compensate the inaccuracy of the model response due to parameter variations. Initially, to set the parameter of ESS electrical model, the proposed approach requires to carry out short preliminary tests that can be easily implemented in a low cost control units. Experimental results and comparisons with other estimation methods highlight the consistency of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223028","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180539/7223003/07223028.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time model-based estimation of SOC and SOH for energy storage systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223028/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Real-time model-based estimation of SOC and SOH for energy storage systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15402762","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7223028/","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time model-based estimation of SOC and SOH for energy storage systems","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071138S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180539","isNumber":"7223003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180539","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7223003","articleId":"7223028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7223037,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Jessen","affiliation":["Chair of Power Electronics Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Jessen","id":"37085646286"},{"name":"Friedrich W.

LCL filters are mainly utilized for the interface of distributed generation systems to the grid due to their small size and effectiveness of current harmonics attenuation. However, owing to the resonance of LCL filters, bandwidth of the current controller of the converters is usually limited far to the resonant frequency of the LCL filter. Otherwise, the system stability would be threatened, especially in high power systems where switching frequency and internal loss are relatively low. In this paper, an active damping method equivalent to the implementation of resistors in series to the filter capacitors is suggested and it is shown that the bandwidth of the LCL filter with the proposed damping method can be extended further than that with a conventional capacitor current feedback type damping method. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally confirmed with a 5kW battery energy storage system connected to the grid.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Damping","Resistors","Capacitors","Power harmonic filters","Regulators","Bandwidth","Power system stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["damping","distributed power generation","electric current control","power grids","power system stability","PWM power convertors","resistors","secondary cells"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["active damping method","series resistor effect","LCL filter","grid-connected PWM converter","distributed generation system","current harmonic attenuation","current controller","power system stability","switching frequency","internal loss","battery energy storage system","power 5 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LCL filter","active damping","grid-connected converter","capacitor current feedback"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223047","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180539/7223003/07223047.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Active damping method equivalent to series resistor effect for LCL filters in a grid-connected PWM converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7223047","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Active damping method equivalent to series resistor effect for LCL filters in a grid-connected PWM converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223047/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7223047/","accessionNumber":"15402783","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active damping method equivalent to series resistor effect for LCL filters in a grid-connected PWM converters","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042195S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180539","isNumber":"7223003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180539","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7223003","articleId":"7223047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7223080,"authors":[{"name":"Majid Pahlevani","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Pahlevani","id":"37078277000"},{"name":"Suzan Eren","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Suzan","lastName":"Eren","id":"37391721300"},{"name":"Alireza Bakhshai","affiliation":["Department of Biomedical Engineering, University of Dammam, Dammam, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Bakhshai","id":"37085366840"},{"name":"Praveen Jain","firstName":"Praveen","lastName":"Jain","id":"37085354746"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8586-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8585-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-5759"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-5767"}],"articleNumber":"7223080","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":291},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Energy storage","Bidirectional control","Observers","Frequency control","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-AC power convertors","distributed power generation","energy storage","nonlinear control systems","power generation control","power system interconnection","smart power grids","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-bus voltage control technique","grid connected AC-DC converters","smart energy storage power conditioning system","closed-loop control system","nonlinear signal processing technique","double frequency ripple","distributed generation","DC extraction","smart energy storage unit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["AC/DC Converter","Bi-Directional Converter","Grid-Connected Converter","Power Factor Correction (PFC)","Adaptive Filter","State Observer","Double-Frequency Ripple","DC-Extraction"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new voltage control technique for grid-connected single-phase AC/DC converters used in an energy storage power conditioning system.

However, it is limited to islanded applications with an LC filter. This paper addresses the stability and control of a grid-connected differential mode buck inverter with an LCL filter. A generalized small-signal model of the inverter is built first with the averaged switching model. It is shown that the LCL filter resonance merely occurs in the differential mode, while an LC filter resonance exists in the common mode, provided that the filter parameters of the two bridges are kept the same. A unified active damping control approach is then proposed for stabilizing the inverter and improving the transient performance under a wide range of grid impedance. Lastly, experimental tests are carried out and the results confirm the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and proposed control approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7223087/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402768","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A unified active damping control for single-phase differential mode buck inverter with LCL-filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified active damping control for single-phase differential mode buck inverter with LCL-filter","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"254.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065358S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180539","isNumber":"7223003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180539","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7223003","articleId":"7223087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7223088,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Xin","affiliation":["Dept. of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Xin","id":"37085592111"},{"name":"Xiongfei Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Xiongfei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540100400"},{"name":"Poh Chiang Loh","affiliation":["Dept. of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Poh Chiang","lastName":"Loh","id":"37275742000"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Dept. of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Frede","lastName":"Blaabjerg","id":"37278889300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8586-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8585-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-5759"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-5767"}],"articleNumber":"7223088","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":442},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Capacitors","Damping","Lead","Control systems","Inductance","Inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit feedback","circuit resonance","LC circuits","power capacitors","power convertors","power filters","power grids","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second-order generalized integrator","noise amplification","discrete implementation","digital systems","grid synchronization","LCL-filtered grid converters","SOGI-based capacitor voltage feedback active damping control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Active damping","LCL-filter","capacitor voltage","derivative","second-order generalized integrator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7223088","doi":"10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223088","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223003","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180539/7223003/07223088.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SOGI-based capacitor voltage feedback active damping in LCL-filtered grid converters","abstract":"The capacitor voltage feedback active damping control is an attractive way to suppress LCL-filter resonance especially for the systems where the capacitor voltage is used for grid synchronization, since no extra sensors are added.

Obtaining a low inductance at such voltage levels is challenging, considering the required clearance distances, the lack of radial style capacitor rated for 10 kV on the market, the package design of CREE 10 kV 10 A 4H-SiC MOSFETs and the required space for the device heater. Ansys Q3D is used in order to extract the parasitic components from the design. Custom designed aluminum cans for 15 kV axial capacitors are used in order to minimize the inductance, with a symmetrical arrangement in order to provide optimal current sharing distribution. Busbar measurements verify the low inductive design of the DC-link. The measured inductance is also validated by means of Finite Element Method analysis and by experimental validation.","doi":"10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223096","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180539/7223003/07223096.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of low impedance busbar for 10 kV, 100A 4H-SiC MOSFET short-circuit tester using axial capacitors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7223096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223096/","displayDocTitle":"Design of low impedance busbar for 10 kV, 100A 4H-SiC MOSFET short-circuit tester using axial capacitors","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402777","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7223096/","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of low impedance busbar for 10 kV, 100A 4H-SiC MOSFET short-circuit tester using axial capacitors","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109255S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180539","isNumber":"7223003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180539","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7223003","articleId":"7223096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7223098,"authors":[{"name":"Kasunaidu Vechalapu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Kasunaidu","lastName":"Vechalapu","id":"37085464587"},{"name":"Subhashish Bhattacharya","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, USA"],"firstName":"Subhashish","lastName":"Bhattacharya","id":"37307719200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8586-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8585-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-5759"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-5767"}],"articleNumber":"7223098","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":589},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7223098","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Valves","Computer architecture","Microprocessors","Automatic voltage control","Switches","Current control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","commutators","dynamic response","invertors","marine power systems","power amplifiers","power generation control","power grids","power transformers","thyristor convertors","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular multilevel cascaded converter","double star bridge cells","medium voltage DC amplifier system","nonlinear load","power electronics","ship board power system","series active inverter","DC side transformer","DC bus","series active inverter compensation","thyristor converter","dynamic response","step changing load","MMCC-DSBC converter","DC output voltage control","boost mode","buck mode","AC three phase system","line commutated converter","STATCOM","AC side grid","DC side pole","pole fault","SAI","voltage 6 kV to 24 kV","voltage 1 kV to 24 kV"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the Modular Multilevel Cascaded Converter based on Double-Star Bridge Cells(MMCC-DSBC) for Medium Voltage DC (MVDC) amplifier is proposed. The medium voltage DC (MVDC) amplifier system is required to validate new technologies, new high power non-linear loads based on power electronics, in all electric ships as part of the proposed medium voltage (MVDC) ship power system. Thyristor based medium voltage DC amplifier (6 kV to 24 kV DC from 4.2 kV (L-L) AC three phase system) with Series Active Inverter (SAI) and DC side transformer in series with DC bus has been reported in the literature, where the series active Inverter compensates the slow dynamics of the Thyristor converter and facilitates fast dynamic response for step changing loads. However, this system has disadvantages as shown in Table III. This paper first shows a control method for AC to DC operation of MMCC-DSBC converter to control the wide DC output voltage in both buck and boost modes from fixed AC source. The simulation results show that the MMCC-DSBC converter provides a variable DC voltage from 6 kV to 24 kV DC and also the extended wide range of output DC voltage - 1 kV to 24 kV - from fixed 4.2 kV (L-L) AC three phase system. It is also shown that this topology will provide fast dynamic response compared to Thyristor based Line Commutated Converter (LCC) without the need of Series Active Inverter, DC side transformer in series with DC bus. This paper also shown the the control method to operate the MMCC-DSBC converter in STATCOM mode-to provide reactive power support to the AC side grid-during DC side pole to pole fault. Simulation results are presented on EMTDC/PSCAD platform to validate the controls.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223003","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223098","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Power Electronics for Distributed Generation Systems (PEDG)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180539/7223003/07223098.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/PEDG.2015.7223098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modular multilevel converter based medium voltage DC amplifier for ship board power system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modular multilevel converter based medium voltage DC amplifier for ship board power system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7223098/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402792","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223098/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modular multilevel converter based medium voltage DC amplifier for ship board power system","confLoc":"Aachen, Germany","sourcePdf":"276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065124S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180539","isNumber":"7223003","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180539","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7223003","articleId":"7223098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7223102,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Paz","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Paz","id":"37085553622"},{"name":"Martin Ordonez","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Ordonez","id":"37542398600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8586-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8585-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-5759"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-5767"}],"articleNumber":"7223102","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":298},"abstract":"Peak energy harvesting in Photovoltaic (PV) systems requires fast and effective Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) detection. Incremental Conductance (InCond) MPPT is one of the most popular detection methods, given its simple implementation and accuracy. In this paper, a new InCond technique is proposed based on small-signal identification and adaptive-step using a Lock-In Amplifier (LIA). The use of small-signal identification virtually eliminates the losses typically encountered in traditional large-signal MPPT perturbations. This feature improves the steady-state efficiency, while the LIA allows for robust and accurate measurement of the equivalent AC resistance to achieve maximum power extraction, even in the presence of noise. The proposed algorithm enables fast tracking during both static and changing environmental conditions, as well as smooth operation in steady-state. The proposed implementation reduces the adaptive-step InCond to a simple Discrete-Time Integral Controller, simplifying its analysis and configuration. Overall, the proposed implementation delivers superior results with similar hardware both during transients and in steady state. Simulations and experimental results are provided to validate the proposed implementation, and to illustrate its behavior in steady and transient operations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

The paper shows how the connected feature changes the vehicle and also presents vulnerabilities of each element to show the importance of cautious system security design.","doi":"10.1109/MTITS.2015.7223297","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223230","startPage":"477","endPage":"482","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175475/7223230/07223297.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MTITS.2015.7223297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security issues and vulnerabilities in connected car systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Security","Logic gates","Mobile handsets","Mobile communication","Wireless communication","Internet"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","intelligent transportation systems","security of data","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["security issues","security vulnerabilities","connected car systems","connected revolution","automotive industry","Internet","fleet management systems","passenger vehicles","infotainment","navigation","vehicular networks","telematics","remote control","keyless entry","security threat","system security design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Connected Car","Security"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Security issues and vulnerabilities in connected car systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223297/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7223297/","accessionNumber":"15402382","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security issues and vulnerabilities in connected car systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"065Becsi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052729S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175475","isNumber":"7223230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175475","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7223230","articleId":"7223297","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"BME","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7223300,"authors":[{"name":"Marina Sergeeva","affiliation":["MAIAA Laboratory, French University of Civil Aviation (ENAC), France"],"firstName":"Marina","lastName":"Sergeeva","id":"37085651519"},{"name":"Daniel Delahaye","affiliation":["MAIAA Laboratory, French University of Civil Aviation (ENAC), France"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Delahaye","id":"37326349800"},{"name":"Catherine Mancel","affiliation":["MAIAA Laboratory, French University of Civil Aviation (ENAC), France"],"firstName":"Catherine","lastName":"Mancel","id":"37085653371"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-6331-3142-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-9-6331-3140-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7223300","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7223300","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aircraft","Atmospheric modeling","Trajectory","Complexity theory","Three-dimensional displays","Shape","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air traffic","genetic algorithms","pattern clustering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D airspace sector design","genetic algorithm","European airspace","mathematical modeling","heuristic optimization methods","automatic airspace sectorization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["airspace sector design","genetic algorithm","k-means clustering","sectorization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MTITS.2015.7223300","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175475/7223230/07223300.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Models and Technologies for Intelligent Transportation Systems (MT-ITS)","startPage":"499","endPage":"506","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MTITS.2015.7223300","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D airspace sector design by genetic algorithm","abstract":"In recent years, special interest has been paid to the solution of sector design problem. The airspace is partitioned into sectors, each of them being controlled by a group of controllers. Airspace sectors should be designed cautiously, ensuring that no sector would be overloaded during the day. The objective of an airspace design process is to adapt the airspace according to the evolution of the traffic. The aim of the presented work is to propose a new global method for the sectorization of the European airspace based on a novel mathematical modeling of the airspace and heuristic optimization methods. The main purpose of this research is to develop a method for automatic airspace sectorization, which would be able to create operationally acceptable sectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223300/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15402344","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7223300/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"3-5 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"3D airspace sector design by genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D airspace sector design by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"068Sergeeva.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051901S","chronDate":"3-5 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175475","isNumber":"7223230","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175475","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7223230","articleId":"7223300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"BME","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7223415,"authors":[{"name":"Yusuke Ujitoko","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo"],"firstName":"Yusuke","lastName":"Ujitoko","id":"37085675273"},{"name":"Koichi Hirota","affiliation":["The University of Tokyo"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Hirota","id":"37085623271"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1727-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1087-8270"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-5334"}],"articleNumber":"7223415","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7223415","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Resistance","Thumb","Snow","Friction","Virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["friction","haptic interfaces","human computer interaction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anthropomorphic finger motion interface","pseduo-haptics","illusory resistance","pseudo friction","finger walking behavior"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Illusory Resistance","Finger walking","Locomotion Interface"]}],"abstract":"We aim to enable additional sensation when using an anthropomorphic finger motion interface.

While good levels of accuracy have been reported, disadvantages include the difficulty of explaining results, and the need to hand-craft appropriate features for standard two-layer networks. Recent advances in the design and training of deep neural networks, which contain more than two layers of hidden neurons, have resulted in improved results in speech and image recognition tasks. This paper investigates the use of deep neural networks for PD diagnosis. Defect samples constructed in mineral oil were used to generate data for training and testing. The paper demonstrates the improvements in accuracy and visualization of learning which can be gained from deep learning.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Partial discharges","Accuracy","Biological neural networks","Training","Computer architecture","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","electrical maintenance","fault diagnosis","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","partial discharges","power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep neural networks","partial discharge data","hidden neurons","partial discharge diagnosis","mineral oil","deep learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","deep learning","partial discharge","diagnostics","UHF monitoring","defects in oil"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICACACT.2014.7223616","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Electrical Insulation Conference (EIC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193737/7223468/07223616.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACACT.2014.7223616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep neural networks for understanding and diagnosing partial discharge data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7223616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deep neural networks for understanding and diagnosing partial discharge data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223616/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7223616/","accessionNumber":"15412355","conferenceDate":"7-10 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep neural networks for understanding and diagnosing partial discharge data","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"0538000224.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050093S","chronDate":"7-10 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193752","isNumber":"7223468","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193737","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7223468","articleId":"7223616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7223639,"authors":[{"name":"Scott Sills","affiliation":["Micron Technology Inc., Boise, Idaho, USA"],"firstName":"Scott","lastName":"Sills","id":"37085391220"},{"name":"Shuichiro Yasuda","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuichiro","lastName":"Yasuda","id":"38230885800"},{"name":"Alessandro Calderoni","affiliation":["Micron Technology Inc., Boise, Idaho, USA"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Calderoni","id":"37396467500"},{"name":"Christopher Cardon","affiliation":["Micron Technology Inc., Boise, Idaho, USA"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Cardon","id":"37085460029"},{"name":"Jonathan Strand","affiliation":["Micron Technology Inc., Boise, Idaho, USA"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Strand","id":"37410727300"},{"name":"Katsuhisa Aratani","affiliation":["Sony Corporation, Atsugi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Katsuhisa","lastName":"Aratani","id":"38227831400"},{"name":"Nirmal Ramaswamy","affiliation":["Micron Technology Inc., Boise, Idaho, USA"],"firstName":"Nirmal","lastName":"Ramaswamy","id":"37698211400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-86348-501-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9682"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1562"}],"articleNumber":"7223639","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":535},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7223639","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Resistance","Transistors","Degradation","Performance evaluation","Conductivity","Very large scale integration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","nanotechnology","resistive RAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ReRAM","technology","bit error rate","BER","storage capacity 16 Gbit","size 27 nm"]}],"abstract":"Enabling a high-density ReRAM product requires: developing a cell that meets a stringent bit error rate, BER, at low program current, integrating the cell without material damage, and providing a high-drive selector at scaled nodes.

For MLC/TLC which requires large number of verification this can reduce the program time substantially. The algorithm is applied to a VG 3D NAND, and program noise and RTN are carefully studied and their impacts incorporated. An optimized dichotomic ISPP method is designed and tight and efficient MLC/TLC programming demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2015.7223669","publicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Technology (VLSI Technology)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Technology (VLSI Technology)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7198535/7223619/07223669.pdf","startPage":"T180","endPage":"T181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2015.7223669","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223619","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7223669","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel dichotomic programming algorithm applied to 3D NAND flash","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223669/","displayDocTitle":"A novel dichotomic programming algorithm applied to 3D NAND flash","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7223669/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"16-18 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15412588","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel dichotomic programming algorithm applied to 3D NAND flash","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037099S","chronDate":"16-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7198535","isNumber":"7223619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7198535","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7223619","articleId":"7223669","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7223670,"authors":[{"name":"Ho-Jung Kang","affiliation":["Department of ECE and ISRC, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Ho-Jung","lastName":"Kang","id":"38572980600"},{"name":"Nagyong Choi","affiliation":["Department of ECE and ISRC, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Nagyong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37085705243"},{"name":"Sung-Min Joe","affiliation":["Department of ECE and ISRC, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Min","lastName":"Joe","id":"37408193200"},{"name":"Ji-Hyun Seo","affiliation":["R&D Division, SK hynix Inc., Icheon, Gyeongki, Korea"],"firstName":"Ji-Hyun","lastName":"Seo","id":"37085409926"},{"name":"Eunseok Choi","affiliation":["R&D Division, SK hynix Inc., Icheon, Gyeongki, Korea"],"firstName":"Eunseok","lastName":"Choi","id":"38597226700"},{"name":"Sung-Kye Park","affiliation":["R&D Division, SK hynix Inc., Icheon, Gyeongki, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Kye","lastName":"Park","id":"37406936900"},{"name":"Byung-Gook Park","affiliation":["Department of ECE and ISRC, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Byung-Gook","lastName":"Park","id":"37085402277"},{"name":"Jong-Ho Lee","affiliation":["Department of ECE and ISRC, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Ho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085367913"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-4-86348-501-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9682"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0743-1562"}],"articleNumber":"7223670","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1662},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memories","Mathematical model","Logic gates","Temperature measurement","Energy measurement","Solid modeling","Tunneling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elemental semiconductors","flash memories","integrated circuit manufacture","integrated circuit measurement","logic gates","silicon","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["word-line biasing","gate length","P-P-P mode","lateral diffusion","cylindrical coordinate","retention model","nitride storage layer","trap density","adjacent cells","tube-type channel structure","3D NAND flash memory cells","retention characteristics","Si"]}],"abstract":"Retention characteristics of a 3-D NAND flash cell with tube-type poly-Si body are investigated at a high temperature (T) depending on program (P), neutral (N), and erase (E) states of adjacent cells.

The operation speed is determined by finite switching time of ferroelectric polarization. For low supply voltage and hysteresis-free design, there exists a ferroelectric material parameter window to maximize the benefit of steep slope by NC. By the optimized device design, the energy efficiency is improved by 2.5x.

More importantly, time constants are stress free and quite stable under electrical stressing. Then, with proposed transient RTN approaches and algorithms, RTN related traps can be detected in a short time and directly utilized in PUF designs.

However, resistance drift is an intrinsic material property that kills memory window and imposes formidable challenges for MLC. In this work, we report a radically different sensing concept that exploits the non-linear R-V characteristics of PCM that can easily accommodate 8 resistance levels in three independent 10X sensing windows (100K\u03a9~1M\u03a9 \u00d7 3) all on same read speed. Each sensing window only needs to store 2~3 resistance levels instead of 8 levels needed in conventional MLC method, thus can tolerate resistance drift without closing the memory windows. A maximum of 16 levels of MLC is demonstrated on a 256Mb chip that is suitable for 4-bits/cell application.","doi":"10.1109/VLSIT.2015.7223706","publicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Technology (VLSI Technology)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 Symposium on VLSI Technology (VLSI Technology)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7198535/7223619/07223706.pdf","startPage":"T94","endPage":"T95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VLSIT.2015.7223706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7223619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Greater than 2-bits/cell MLC storage for ultra high density phase change memory using a novel sensing scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7223706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Greater than 2-bits/cell MLC storage for ultra high density phase change memory using a novel sensing scheme","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7223706/","accessionNumber":"15412565","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Greater than 2-bits/cell MLC storage for ultra high density phase change memory using a novel sensing scheme","confLoc":"Kyoto, Japan","sourcePdf":"T72.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048059S","chronDate":"16-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7198535","isNumber":"7223619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7198535","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7223619","articleId":"7223706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"JSAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7223708,"authors":[{"name":"V.

We show how the elemental distribution reaches an equilibrium at the core of the storage element after the electrical activation of the cell, which relates to the strong opposition against crystallization of the RESET state. We also highlight the low number of grain boundaries along the conductive path of the optimized SET state, thus explaining the low drift of the resistance.

prevention ion implant","abstract":"Generally, LCD(liquid crystal display) driver IC(integrated circuit) requires high voltage of more than 10V and adopts MTI(middle trench isolation) scheme which is deeply trenched to get isolation characteristics on the high voltage according to chip shrinkage. The Vth(Threshold Voltage) shift of HV devices after HTOL(high temperature operating life time) becomes much more serious hazard for product reliability. HV p-channel MOSFET(PMOS) with trench isolation scheme are especially sensitive to these Vth shift issues caused by HEIP. It was found that electron trapping at interface between sidewall oxide and nitride liner in middle trench isolation(MTI) induces channel shorting due to punch through by lowering Vth at the corner of transistor, thereby resulting in the leakage current. This leakage current increment caused by Vth shift makes logic function fail. In this paper, we propose the optimized sidewall thickness and the effectiveness of additional ion implant process which have strong resistance against hot electron induced punch through regarding that offset leakage current is increased after HTOL(high temperature operating lifetime) stressing test for devices prepared with MTI processing scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224406/","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15402146","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7224406/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"HV PMOSFET V<inf>T</inf> shift suppression after HTOL by modified p-Hump prevention ion implant","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HV PMOSFET V<inf>T</inf> shift suppression after HTOL by modified p-Hump prevention ion implant","confLoc":"Hsinchu, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"P51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05947S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173157","isNumber":"7224314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173157","xplore-issue":"7224314","articleId":"7224406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7224421,"authors":[{"name":"Yang-Shun Fan","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Yang-Shun","lastName":"Fan","id":"37900654500"},{"name":"Wei-Liang Chan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Wei-Liang","lastName":"Chan","id":"37085613624"},{"name":"Chih-Hsiang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Photonics and Institute of Electro-Optical Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chih-Hsiang","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085620889"},{"name":"Guang-Ting Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Guang-Ting","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085629000"},{"name":"Che-Chia Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering and Institute of Electronics, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, R.O.C"],"firstName":"Che-Chia","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085620900"},{"name":"Po-Tsun Liu","affiliation":["Departrnent of Photonics and Display Institute, National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Po-Tsun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37290197600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-9928-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-1542"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1550"}],"articleNumber":"7224421","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance and reliability of non-linear Al-Zn-Sn-O based resistive random access memory","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173157/7224314/07224421.pdf","startPage":"381","endPage":"384","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on the Physical and Failure Analysis of Integrated Circuits","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPFA.2015.7224421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224314","doi":"10.1109/IPFA.2015.7224421","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Aluminum oxide","Arrays","Reliability","Microprocessors","Tunneling","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium","oxygen","resistive RAM","semiconductor device reliability","semiconductor doping","tin","zinc"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunnel barrier","RRAM cell","resistive random access memory","Al-Zn-Sn-O","Al2O3"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224421","abstract":"The Al-doped zinc tin oxide based RRAM with non-linearity characteristic was demonstrated.

In this work, we investigated the data retention and random telegraph noise (RTN) characteristics on intermediate resistance states (IRS) which were programmed in Set and Reset process for the first time. The main observations are as follows: 1. Although the IRS-SET have higher decay factor `\u03c4', the IRS-Reset has better data retention than IRS-Set; 2. The MLC-Set states exhibit lower mean P2p values and better resistance distribution compared with the IRS-Reset states. A comprehensive physical model was proposed to account for the results. Moreover, implicative approaches to increase the robustness of MLC storage are suggested.","doi":"10.1109/IPFA.2015.7224454","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on the Physical

We proposed some improved program/erase (P/E) methods to precisely control the fluctuation of the resistance states.

In the global competition, especially so-called high-price countries have to present arguments why the higher development cost is justified and what makes these countries an attractive host for software companies. Often, high-quality engineering and excellent quality of products, e.g., Machinery and equipment, are mentioned. Yet, the question is: Can such arguments be also found for the software industry? We aim at investigating the degree of professionalism and systematization of software development to draw a map of strengths and weaknesses. To this end, we conducted as a first step an exploratory survey in Germany, presented in this paper. In this survey, we focused on the perceived importance of the two general software engineering process areas project- and quality management and their implementation in practice. So far, our results suggest that the necessity for a systematic software development is well recognized, while software development still follows an ad-hoc rather than a systematized style. Our results provide initial findings, which we finally use to elaborate a set of working hypotheses. Those hypotheses allow to steer the adaptation of our instrument in the future to eventually facilitate replications toward a more comprehensive theory on systematic globally distributed software development in practice.","doi":"10.1109/ICGSE.2015.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224463","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGSE.2015.11","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th International Conference on Global Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 10th International Conference on Global Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7217953/7224463/07224481.pdf","startPage":"51","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Software Development: A State of the Practice Report from Germany","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224481/","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Software Development: A State of the Practice Report from Germany","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-16 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15431929","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7224481/","publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Software Development: A State of the Practice Report from Germany","confLoc":"Ciudad Real, Spain","sourcePdf":"8409a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133397S","chronDate":"13-16 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7217953","isNumber":"7224463","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7217953","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7224463","articleId":"7224481","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7224484,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Abdur Razzak","affiliation":["Daffodil International University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Mohammad Abdur","lastName":"Razzak","id":"37085385586"},{"name":"Darja mite","affiliation":["Blekinge Tekniska Hogskola, Karlskrona, SE"],"firstName":"Darja","lastName":"mite","id":"37086895896"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8409-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8408-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2329-6305"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2329-6313"}],"articleNumber":"7224484","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":611},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software","Knowledge management","Interviews","Companies","Knowledge engineering","Project management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge management","project management","software houses","software prototyping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["knowledge management","globally distributed agile projects","software project","global software development","Software organizations","software team performance improvement","knowledge creation","knowledge sharing","semistructured qualitative interviews","knowledge codification","technocratic KM strategies","behavioral KM strategies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Knowledge management","knowledge sharing","distributed","global software engineering","agile","shared understanding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224484","abstract":"Knowledge management (KM) is essential for success in any software project, but especially in global software development where team members are separated by time and space. Software organizations are managing knowledge in various ways to increase transparency and improve software team performance. One way to classify these strategies is proposed by Earl who defined seven knowledge management schools. The objective of this research is to study knowledge creation and sharing practices in a number of distributed agile projects, map these practices to the knowledge management strategies and determine which strategies are most common, which are applied only locally and which are applied globally. This is done by conducting a series of semi-structured qualitative interviews over a period of time span during May, 2012-June, 2013.

The predictive model of the living room is developed by training a feed forward RNN and then optimisation algorithms are used to calculate the optimal flowrate for the radiators. Three optimisation algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, and Sequential quadratic programming (SQP) optimization algorithm are investigated to calculate the optimal control input. The accuracy of the control scheme is verified by simulations using International Building Physics Toolbox (IBPT). It was found that mean squared error (MSE) for PSO is 38.87% less than GA and the MSE for PSO is 21.19% less than SQP. The RNN model based optimization technique is further compared with model predictive controller (MPC) designed for the radiator based heating system. The comparison results showed that the proposed RNN technique minimize the energy consumption and maintains accurate room thermal comfort according to the predicted mean vote (PMV) based setpoints.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling and optimization of residential heating system using random neural networks","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCSSE.2014.7224515","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174421/7224496/07224515.pdf","startPage":"90","endPage":"95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCSSE.2014.7224515","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224515","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224515/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Modelling and optimization of residential heating system using random neural networks","conferenceDate":"29-30 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224515/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15402237","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling and optimization of residential heating system using random neural networks","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"19CCSSE20141129.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082923S","chronDate":"29-30 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7174421","isNumber":"7224496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174421","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7224496","articleId":"7224515","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224524,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Control Engineering, Chang'an University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085500107"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6397-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6396-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6395-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7224524","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224524","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Rail transportation","Fault diagnosis","Training","Neural networks","Switches","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fault diagnosis","neural nets","railways"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["railway turnout fault diagnosis algorithm","BP neural network","intelligent detection algorithm","turnout switch machine","turnout fault operating current curve","mapping data set","action current","turnout fault type","station interlocking equipment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["turnout","switch machine","action current curve","operating current curve","hyperactivity turnout","interlocking equipment"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCSSE.2014.7224524","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174421/7224496/07224524.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering","startPage":"135","endPage":"138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCSSE.2014.7224524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The railway turnout fault diagnosis algorithm based on BP neural network","abstract":"This paper presents an intelligent detection algorithm based on BP Neural Network, which is based on the current curve change rule of the turnout switch machine.

The scheme proposed can not only detect the abnormal events which have been studied, but also detect the possible location of abnormal events. People usually instinctively escape from a place where abnormal or dangerous events occur. Based on this inference, a novel algorithm of detecting the divergent center is proposed: The divergent center indicates possible place where abnormal events occur. The model of crowd motion in both the normal and abnormal situations has been made according to the proposed method. Intersections of vector are obtained through solving the straight line equation sets, where the straight line Equation sets are determined by the location and direction of motion vector which are calculated by the optical flow. Then the dense regions of intersection sets, i.e., the divergent center, are obtained by using the distance segmentation method, the threshold method and the graphical method. Escape detection is finally judged according to the speed and energy of motion and the divergent center. Experiments on UMN datasets and other real videos show that the proposed method is valid on crowd escape behavior detection.","doi":"10.1109/CCSSE.2014.7224535","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174421/7224496/07224535.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCSSE.2014.7224535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anomalous crowd behavior detection and localization in video surveillance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224535/","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous crowd behavior detection and localization in video surveillance","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15402242","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224535/","conferenceDate":"29-30 Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous crowd behavior detection and localization in video surveillance","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"39CCSSE20141140.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048969S","chronDate":"29-30 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7174421","isNumber":"7224496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174421","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7224496","articleId":"7224535","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224536,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Han","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Han","id":"37085676085"},{"name":"Yuqing Lan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuqing","lastName":"Lan","id":"37414675400"},{"name":"Limin Xiao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Limin","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37351600100"},{"name":"Binyang Huang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Binyang","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085663809"},{"name":"Kai Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085660516"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6397-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6396-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6395-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7224536","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":92},"abstract":"Event detection through sensors data recording human activities is an aspect to learn human behaviors. In this paper, counted numbers from a sensor installed on a building entrance recording the number of people entering the building, will be processed to find the anomaly time interval when there are more people going through the entrance, which is viewed as event. An approach is adopted having two steps: first, the counted numbers over time is processed by Fourier Transformation and we get the parameter of a vector (ReX[k], ImX[k]) representing kth point in the data set; second, the vectors of (ReX[k], ImX[k]) are classified by KNN algorithm in two dimensions, categorizing the data in the same time interval in 70 days and the data in 48 intervals in one day. The results show that the proposed method works well.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174421/7224496/07224536.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"199","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Control Science and Systems Engineering","doi":"10.1109/CCSSE.2014.7224536","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCSSE.2014.7224536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224496","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event detection with vector similarity based on fourier transformation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Frequency-domain analysis","Time-domain analysis","Data models","Event detection","Sensors","Time series analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","Fourier transforms","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector similarity","event detection","sensors data","human activities","human behaviors learning","building entrance","anomaly time interval","Fourier transformation","vector parameter","classification","KNN algorithm","data categorization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["event detection","vector similarity","Fourier Transformation","KNN"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224536/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-30 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Event detection with vector similarity based on fourier transformation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224536/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15402261","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"29-30 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Event detection with vector similarity based on fourier transformation","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"40CCSSE20142222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071494S","chronDate":"29-30 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7174421","isNumber":"7224496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174421","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7224496","articleId":"7224536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224554,"authors":[{"name":"Sandro Machado Ribeiro","affiliation":["Pontif\u00edcia Universidade, Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul - PUCRS"],"firstName":"Sandro Machado","lastName":"Ribeiro","id":"37085702192"},{"name":"Ludimila La Rosa Centeno","affiliation":["Pontif\u00edcia Universidade, Cat\u00f3lica do Rio Grande do Sul - PUCRS"],"firstName":"Ludimila","lastName":"La Rosa Centeno","id":"37088490221"},{"name":"Maria C.

This work proposes a novel approach for channel allocation in Cognitive Radio (CR) networks, through the use of a predictive and adaptive database. The aim of the proposed method is to improve the performance of the SM on the channel allocation procedure in cognitive radio networks. The SM uses the predicted data, obtained through a spectrum-modeling algorithm that emulates channel utilization, in order to allocate those channels with higher probability of being idle. The adaptive characteristic is ensured through periodic updates of the database, which are based on channel sensing results. Thus, channels are ranked so that those with best performance are preferred for SU allocation. Simulation results show that the use of the predictive and adaptive features presents better results than methods that do not consider such features. Furthermore, the results show that the number of channel sensing operations performed by the cognitive devices is greatly reduced when using the proposed channel allocation method, which improves the overall network performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224554/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15402295","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224554/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Channel allocation in Cognitive Radio networks based on a predictive and adaptive database","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel allocation in Cognitive Radio networks based on a predictive and adaptive database","confLoc":"Santa Rita do Sapucai, Brazil","sourcePdf":"IWT2015TS21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060906S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175474","isNumber":"7224545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175474","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7224545","articleId":"7224554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7224559,"authors":[{"name":"Felipe A.

Among these drivers the Internet of Things has gained momentum due to its potential to leverage Machine Type Communications (MTC), a term used to denote machine-centered communications among sporadic, bursty traffic generating devices. While scalability issues have been addressed by the community, less is understood to date about the use of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) techniques in the context of MTC networks. In this paper, we propose the use of a Massive Multiuser (MU)-MIMO\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n setup as means to tackle the uplink mixed-service communication problem. Under the assumption of an available physical narrowband shared channel, the capacity of the MTC network and, in turn, that of the whole system, can be increased by grouping MTC devices into clusters and letting each cluster share the same time-frequency physical resource blocks. The individual data streams conveyed by spatially spread MTC signals can be separated thanks to the powerful processing gain of our Massive MU-MIMO setup, where we consider K single-antenna MTC devices served by a BS equipped with an array of M antennas, M >> K. Our simulation results suggest that, as M is made progressively larger, the performance of sub-optimal linear filtering methods approach the matched filter bound, also known as perfect interference-cancellation bound. Zero Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) approach the bound at a faster pace than simple Maximum Ratio Combining (MRC), although the performance gap of the latter is of only 2 dB for M = 500 antennas. Due to its better balance between interference suppression and noise enhancement, MMSE outperforms MRC and ZF in all cases studied. The gap in the performance of ZF, however, is negligible for array sizes around 50 antennas, and entirely vanishes when the BS is equipped with M > 100 antennas.","doi":"10.1109/IWT.2015.7224559","publicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on Telecommunications (IWT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Workshop on Telecommunications (IWT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175474/7224545/07224559.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWT.2015.7224559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the application of massive MU-MIMO in the uplink of machine type communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224559","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224559/","displayDocTitle":"On the application of massive MU-MIMO in the uplink of machine type communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402304","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224559/","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the application of massive MU-MIMO in the uplink of machine type communication systems","confLoc":"Santa Rita do Sapucai, Brazil","sourcePdf":"IWT2015TS32.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110275S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175474","isNumber":"7224545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175474","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7224545","articleId":"7224559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224565,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In this work, the use of particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to calculate different transmission powers for each node, without creating disconnected areas in a sensors cluster. The achieved results show that the proposed PSO algorithm is able to save sensors energy when compared to the common deployment of nodes with a single transmission power.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-17 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224573/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15402314","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224573/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"14-17 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization implementation for minimal transmission power providing a fully-connected cluster for the Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization implementation for minimal transmission power providing a fully-connected cluster for the Internet of Things","confLoc":"Santa Rita do Sapucai, Brazil","sourcePdf":"IWT2015TS71.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100766S","chronDate":"14-17 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175474","isNumber":"7224545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175474","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7224545","articleId":"7224573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7224574,"authors":[{"name":"Diego de Azevedo Gomes","affiliation":["Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1, Bel\u00e9m, PA, Brazil"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"de Azevedo Gomes","id":"37085612443"},{"name":"Igor Freire","affiliation":["Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1, Bel\u00e9m, PA, Brazil"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Freire","id":"37085411110"},{"name":"Aldebaro Klautau","affiliation":["Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1, Bel\u00e9m, PA, Brazil"],"firstName":"Aldebaro","lastName":"Klautau","id":"37393296500"},{"name":"Evaldo Pelaes","affiliation":["Universidade Federal do Par\u00e1, Bel\u00e9m, PA, Brazil"],"firstName":"Evaldo","lastName":"Pelaes","id":"37829085000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7622-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7224574","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","Noise","Gain","Decoding","Couplings","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["alien crosstalk mitigation","receiver-side MIMO processing","G.fast systems","ITU-T standard","copper-based transmission","crosstalk mitigation method","noise prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DSL","G.fast","alien crosstalk","white noise","vectoring","linear prediction"]}],"abstract":"G.fast is the most recent ITU-T standard for copper-based transmission, which targets at short distances and adopts a bandwidth of 106 MHz extensible to 212 MHz.

Simulation results show that alien crosstalk mitigation methods can indeed improve the performance of G.fast systems, but under specific conditions.

In this work, we have done an extensive survey of fault tolerant protocols and ant colony algorithms applied to routing in MANETs. We propose a QoS constrained fault tolerant ant lookahead routing algorithm which attempts to identify valid route and look-ahead route pairs which might help in choosing the alternate path in case of valid route failure.

In light of future 5G mobile networks moving toward decentralization based on cloudlets, intelligent base stations, and MEC, the inherent distributed processing and storage capabilities of radio-and-fiber (R&F) networks may be exploited for new applications, e.g., cognitive assistance, augmented reality, or cloud robotics. In this paper, we first revisit fiber-wireless (FiWi) networks in the context of conventional clouds and emerging cloudlets, thereby highlighting the limitations of conventional radio-overfiber (RoF) networks such as China Mobile's centralized cloud radio access network (C-RAN) to meet the aforementioned trends. Furthermore, we pay close attention to the specific design challenges of data center networks and revisit our switchless arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) based network with efficient support of east-west flows and enhanced scalability.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2015.7224704","publicationTitle":"China Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7224691/07224704.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2015.7224704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224691","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Invited paper: The audacity of fiber-wireless (FiWi) networks: revisited for clouds and cloudlets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224704/","displayDocTitle":"Invited paper: The audacity of fiber-wireless (FiWi) networks: revisited for clouds and cloudlets","volume":"12","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15413849","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Invited paper: The audacity of fiber-wireless (FiWi) networks: revisited for clouds and cloudlets","sourcePdf":"4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051787S","chronDate":"August  2015","isNumber":"7224691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"17","articleId":"7224704","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224706,"authors":[{"name":"Chengbing He","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Chengbing","lastName":"He"},{"name":"Siyu Huo","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Siyu","lastName":"Huo"},{"name":"Qunfei Zhang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Qunfei","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Han Wang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Wang"},{"name":"Jianguo Huang","affiliation":["Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Jianguo","lastName":"Huang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7224706","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"abstract":"Recently, single carrier block transmission (SCBT) has received much attention in high-rate phase-coherent underwater acoustic communication. However, minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) linear FDE may suffer performance loss in the severely time dispersive underwater acoustic channel. To combat the channel distortion, a novel multi-channel receiver with maximum ratio combining and a low complex T/4 fractional iterative frequency domain equalization (FDE) is investigated to improve diversity gain and the bit error rate (BER) performance. The proposed method has been verified by the real data from a lake underwater acoustic communication test in November 2011. At 1.8 km, the useful data rates are around 1500 and 3000 bits/ s for BPSK and QPSK respectively. The results show the improvements of system performance. Compared with MMSE FDE system, the output SNR improvement is 6.9 dB, and the BER is from 10-3 to no error bits for BPSK. The output SNR improvement is 5.3 dB, and the BER is from 1.91\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2 to 2.2\u00d710-4</sup>\n for QPSK.","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7224691/07224706.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"61","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doi":"10.1109/CC.2015.7224706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2015.7224706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224691","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224706","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-channel iterative FDE for single carrier block transmission over underwater acoustic channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Frequency-domain analysis","Bit error rate","Receivers","Underwater acoustics","Equalizers","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","equalisers","error statistics","iterative methods","quadrature phase shift keying","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multichannel iterative FDE","single carrier block transmission","SCBT","dispersive underwater acoustic channel","high-rate phase-coherent underwater acoustic communication","channel distortion","multichannel receiver","maximum ratio combining","low complex T-4 fractional iterative frequency domain equalization","diversity gain improvement","bit error rate performance improvement","lake underwater acoustic communication test","data rates","BPSK","QPSK","noise figure 5.3 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["underwater acoustic communication;single carrier; multi-channel frequency domain equalization; iterative processing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224706/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-channel iterative FDE for single carrier block transmission over underwater acoustic channels","volume":"12","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15413856","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-channel iterative FDE for single carrier block transmission over underwater acoustic channels","sourcePdf":"6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030246S","chronDate":"August  2015","isNumber":"7224691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7224706","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224708,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Shi","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Shi"},{"name":"Xuesong Qiu","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Xuesong","lastName":"Qiu"},{"name":"Shaoyong Guo","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Shaoyong","lastName":"Guo"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1673-5447"}],"articleNumber":"7224708","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":560},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Smart grids","Optimization","Economics","Power demand","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","power system reliability","smart meters","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","optimization method","advanced metering infrastructure","AMI","data analysis","smart meters","home area network","HAN gateways","data concentrators","network economic loss","data concentrator failures","reliability","economic smart grid communication network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["smart grid; advanced metering infrastructure; redundancy optimization; dataconcentrator; genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224708","abstract":"This paper proposes a redundancy optimization method for smart grid Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) to realize economy and reliability targets. AMI is a crucial part of the smart grid to measure, collect, and analyze data about energy usage and power quality from customer premises. From the communication perspective, the AMI consists of smart meters, Home Area Network (HAN) gateways and data concentrators; in particular, the redundancy optimization problem focus on deciding which data concentrator needs redundancy. In order to solve the problem, we first develop a quantitative analysis model for the network economic loss caused by the data concentrator failures. Then, we establish a complete redundancy optimization model, which comprehensively consider the factors of reliability and economy. Finally, an advanced redundancy deployment method based on genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to solve the proposed problem. The simulation results testify that the proposed redundancy optimization method is capable to build a reliable and economic smart grid communication network.","doi":"10.1109/CC.2015.7224708","startPage":"73","endPage":"84","publicationTitle":"China Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CC.2015.7224708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224691","displayPublicationTitle":"China Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245522/7224691/07224708.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm-based redundancy optimization method for smart grid communication network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224708/","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm-based redundancy optimization method for smart grid communication network","volume":"12","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15413848","publicationDate":"August 2015","dateOfInsertion":"28 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm-based redundancy optimization method for smart grid communication network","sourcePdf":"8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028818S","chronDate":"August  2015","isNumber":"7224691","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245522","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7224708","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7224717,"authors":[{"name":"Michael J.

Inspiringly, the emerging crowdsourcing paradigms provide an innovative and effective way for large-scale RSS gathering. However, existing methods need sampling data and location information from participants, which could be a serious threat to privacy. In dealing with this difficulty, we present a privacy preserving RSS map generation scheme for crowdsensing networks called PRESM. To protect the privacy of user traces, we exploit the compressive sensing technique to sample and compress RSS values along each road segment, which removes the temporal and concrete location information of each participant. Meanwhile, each smartphone user carefully selects a subset of road segments to send its compressed RSS data to a third party. The third party component provides better privacy protection by removing more road segments, and the central server is responsible for RSS map generation. Finally, we carry out our experiment on a campus of approximately 1.6 km2 . Experimental results demonstrate that an RSS map is generated relatively accurately without sacrificing users' trace privacy, and the coverage ratio of the geographic map is greater than 90 percent.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7224726","startPage":"42","endPage":"48","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7224714/07224726.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7224726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224714","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy preserving RSS map generation for a crowdsensing network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crowdsensing","Privacy","Servers","Data privacy","Noise measurement","Layout","Calibration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data protection","geography","mobile computing","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["privacy preserving RSS map generation scheme","crowdsensing network","mobile computing","AP deployment","large-scale RSS gathering","PRESM","privacy protection","compressive sensing technique","road segments","third party component"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224726/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","displayDocTitle":"Privacy preserving RSS map generation for a crowdsensing network","volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7224726/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15400733","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy preserving RSS map generation for a crowdsensing network","sourcePdf":"012WU_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052693S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7224714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7224714","articleId":"7224726","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7224728,"authors":[{"name":"Keisuke Miyanabe","affiliation":["Tohoku Daigaku, Sendai, Miyagi, JP"],"bio":{"p":["Keisuke Miyanabe [s'13] (nabe@it.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp) is pursuing the M.S. degree at the Graduate School of Information Sciences at Tohoku University.

Until now, only a few researchers considered the design and operation of C-RANs based on QoE. In this article we describe our envisioned C-RAN based on passive optical networks (PONs) exploiting power over fiber (PoF), which can be installed with low installation cost and is capable of providing communication services without external power supply for remote radio head (RRH), and describe QoE requirement on the envisioned network. For all users in the envisioned network to satisfy their QoE, effective network design and operation approaches are then presented. Our proposed design and operation approaches demonstrate how to construct the envisioned network, i.e. the numbers of RRHs and optical line terminals (OLTs), and sleep scheduling of RRHs for an energy-efficient optical power transmission.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15400732","htmlLink":"/document/7224728/","displayDocTitle":"A cloud radio access network with power over fiber toward 5G networks: QoE-guaranteed design and operation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A cloud radio access network with power over fiber toward 5G networks: QoE-guaranteed design and operation","sourcePdf":"014MIYANABE_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0612S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7224714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7224714","articleId":"7224728","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7224730,"authors":[{"name":"Hongwei Li","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China","State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing"],"bio":{"p":["Hongwei Li is an associate professor with the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, China.

Of all the mobile cloud computing applications, data outsourcing, such as iCloud, is fundamental, which outsources a mobile user's data to external cloud servers and accordingly provides a scalable and \u201calways on\u201d approach for public data access. With the security and privacy issues related to outsourced data becoming a rising concern, encryption on outsourced data is often necessary. Although encryption increases the quality of protection (QoP) of data outsourcing, it significantly reduces data usability and thus harms the mobile user's quality of experience (QoE). How to strike a balance between QoP and QoE is therefore an important yet challenging task. In this article we focus on the fundamental problem of QoP and QoE provisioning in searchable encryption of data outsourcing. We develop a fine-grained data search scheme and discuss its implementation on encrypted mobile cloud data, which is an effective balance between QoE and QoP in mobile cloud data outsourcing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224730/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","volume":"22","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15400736","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7224730/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Engineering searchable encryption of mobile cloud networks: when QoE meets QoP","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Engineering searchable encryption of mobile cloud networks: when QoE meets QoP","sourcePdf":"016LI2_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070017S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7224714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"7224714","articleId":"7224730","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7224731,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Zeng","affiliation":["Huazhong University of Science and Technology"],"bio":{"p":["Jing Zeng is currently a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China.

VLC has desirable high bandwidth density (b/s/m2) stemming from the directionality of optical signals, and can exist as part of installed infrastructure in LED-based luminaires. In spite of these benefits, it is best paired with complementary RF technologies to overcome limitations of line of sight, glare in optical uplink, and use cases requiring darkness. The combination of VLC and RF shows promise to overcome limitations of each medium if successfully paired. In this article we describe motivating factors for VLC usage in environments with a high density of user devices, present models for VLC integration with RF technologies, define system components required for practical deployment, and evaluate scenarios where VLC integration is most beneficial. We show that by selecting appropriate operating conditions for each of the RF and VLC solutions, we can realize substantial improvement in the resulting heterogeneous network design.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward practical integration of dual-use VLC within 5G networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2015.7224733","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742/7224714/07224733.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"103","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2015.7224733","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2015","displayDocTitle":"Toward practical integration of dual-use VLC within 5G networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7224733/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"August 2015","accessionNumber":"15400737","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward practical integration of dual-use VLC within 5G networks","sourcePdf":"019RAHAIM_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052397S","chronDate":"August  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"7224714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7224714","articleId":"7224733","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224734,"authors":[{"name":"Kuan Zhang","affiliation":["University of Waterloo"],"bio":{"p":["Kuan Zhang [s'13] received his B.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering and his M.Sc. degree in computer science from Northeastern University, China, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

Specifically, we first introduce the architecture of MHN, and point out the security and privacy challenges from the perspective of QoP.

By employing the high resolution angle estimation method MUSIC and space-alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) algorithm, the angular power spectrum in azimuth at each element along the virtual linear array are obtained.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel measurements and angle estimation for massive MIMO systems in a stadium","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224767","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166144/7224736/07224767.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Channel measurements and angle estimation for massive MIMO systems in a stadium","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224767/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15401667","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel measurements and angle estimation for massive MIMO systems in a stadium","confLoc":"PyeongChang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"022A02505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080001S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166144","isNumber":"7224736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166144","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7224736","articleId":"7224767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GiRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224781,"authors":[{"name":"Hao Sun","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7166144/7224736/7224781/7224781-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hao Sun, he was born on June 29,1990.

In relation to video lectures, one of the utmost important concerns is professional video recording. Video recording inside lecture halls requires experienced camera-work professionals, who can record video lecture in an eye-catching way that keep the viewer concentration. To eliminate the overhead of expensive camera-work professionals, recently, image recognition algorithms combined with camera controllers make automatic lecture recording possible. In this article, we present real time implementation of the field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) based automatic lecture recording system. The system comprises of FPGA board, which can take input from analog and/or digital video camera, the ARM processor unit, and camera mounted stepper motor. Real time Image recognition algorithms are used to detect the region of interest (ROI) boundaries, instructor's face, and instructor's movement direction.

Sampling jitter will seriously degrade the performance of the receiver, which can be improved effectively by digital compensation algorithm. This paper investigates the sampling jittering mitigation for the direct RF bandpass sampling receiver. Under the direct RF bandpass sampling receiver architecture, an approximate sampling jitter model is derived. From the model, it is noted that the adverse impact of the sampling jitter is presented as the phase noise component of the carrier. As a result, a sampling jitter migration approach is developed to eliminate the phase noise. Specifically, the cascade multipliers is able to effectively migrate the sampling jitter. The proposed jitter mitigation method requires low complexity, and can be easily implemented by hardware. Moreover, it has many merits over the existing sampling jitter migration algorithms, including real-time sampling clock jitter elimination, flexible implementation to meet the specific performance requirements by selecting different level of cascaded sampling jitter migration structure. Several experiments have been conducted with 3GPP LTE type signals. The root-mean-square (RMS) and SNR are taken as the performance measurements. Experimental results show that the proposed sampling jitter migration method is able to remove the adverse effect of the sampling jitter with a comparable performance of existing techniques at much lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224829","startPage":"413","endPage":"418","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166144/7224736/07224829.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224736","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling jitter mitigation with a cascade multiplier for direct RF bandpass sampling receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sampling jitter mitigation with a cascade multiplier for direct RF bandpass sampling receiver","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224829/","accessionNumber":"15401696","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224829/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling jitter mitigation with a cascade multiplier for direct RF bandpass sampling receiver","confLoc":"PyeongChang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"024A02290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038934S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166144","isNumber":"7224736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166144","xplore-issue":"7224736","articleId":"7224829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GiRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224830,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["Information & Communication Dispatching and Control Center State Grid Information & Telecommunication, Branch, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7166144/7224736/7224830/7224830-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun Liu received the B.

This paper focuses on how to improve the energy efficiency of terminals in OFDMA-based wireless multicast systems with frequency-selective channels. We assume that multicast terminals can switch to sleep mode during the transmission of some OFDM symbols according to their OFDMA frame-level quality of service (QoS) requirements. Based on it, we combine resource allocation with terminal sleeping mechanism, and propose a new resource allocation problem model. The task is to minimize the total time when terminals are in receive mode through jointly optimizing the subcarrier allocation for different multicast terminals and the power allocation between different subcarriers, which is a NP-hard problem. To adapt to the needs of real-time applications, we separate subcarrier and power allocation, and propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm for this problem. Performance evaluations are conducted in homogenous and heterogeneous networks respectively. Simulation results show that compared with traditional multicast and unicast, our proposed method reduce the total energy consumption of terminals significantly with the same QoS requirements of terminals guaranteed. Additionally, the advantage of our proposed method over traditional multicast diminishes with the increase of the maximum transmission power, and increase with the number of multicast terminals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166144/7224736/07224830.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"426","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224830","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224830","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient resource allocation in OFDMA-based wireless multicast systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Energy consumption","Quality of service","OFDM","Energy efficiency","Unicast","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","energy conservation","frequency division multiple access","multicast communication","OFDM modulation","optimisation","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-efficient resource allocation","OFDMA","wireless multicast systems","smart mobile terminal","frequency-selective channels","OFDM symbols","quality of service","QoS","subcarrier allocation","NP-hard problem","maximum transmission power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Energy Consumption","Terminal","Resource Allocation","OFDMA","Multicast"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient resource allocation in OFDMA-based wireless multicast systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224830/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15401684","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient resource allocation in OFDMA-based wireless multicast systems","confLoc":"PyeongChang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"024A03292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058112S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166144","isNumber":"7224736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166144","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7224736","articleId":"7224830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GiRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224847,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-woo Kim","affiliation":["ETRI (Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute), Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7166144/7224736/7224847/7224847-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-woo Kim received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Kyongpook National University, Daegu, Korea, in 1996, the MS from KAIST, Daejeon, Korea in 1998, and the Ph.D degree from Chungnam National University, Daejeon, Korea in 2013.","From January 1998 to September 2001, he was a researcher of Dacom Corporation.

In practical OFDM system, the CP lengths are fixed. When the CP length is shorter than the channel impulse response (CIR) length, referred to as \"insufficient CP\", significant signal distortion can occur at the receiver. This paper proposes the use of precoding technique at the transmitter to solve the ISI and ICI problems owing to insufficient CP. Precoding is first derived for single-input single-output (SISO) OFDM system, and then generalized for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) OFDM system. Simulation results on the bit error rate (BER) versus the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) demonstrate that the proposed precoding technique is much more efficient the conventional OFDM with one-tap equalization when the CP is insufficient.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166144/7224736/07224891.pdf","startPage":"727","endPage":"732","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224891","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224891","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224891","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study of insufficient cyclic prefix by using precoding for MIMO-OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Time-domain analysis","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","intercarrier interference","intersymbol interference","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","precoding","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple input multiple output system","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","MIMO-OFDM systems","insufficient cyclic prefix","precoding","intersymbol interference","intercarrier interference","channel impulse response","signal distortion","radio transmitter","single-input single-output system","SISO OFDM system","bit error rate","BER","signal-to-noise ratio","one-tap equalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM","precoding","cyclic prefix","channel dependent","insufficient length"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224891/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A study of insufficient cyclic prefix by using precoding for MIMO-OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224891/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15401758","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study of insufficient cyclic prefix by using precoding for MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"PyeongChang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"026A04414.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069293S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166144","isNumber":"7224736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166144","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7224736","articleId":"7224891","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GiRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7224920,"authors":[{"name":"Julian Webber","affiliation":["Advanced Telecommunications Research International 2-2-2, Hikaridai, Seika-cho, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7166144/7224736/7224920/7224920-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Julian WEBBER received the M.

Recently we demonstrated an enhanced poly-polarization multiplexing (EPPM) system incorporating L&R frequency recovery as a hardware prototype in order to evaluate its high spectral-efficiency in a real satellite channel. In order to provide sufficient performance at low SNR, it is recommended to average the correlation estimates over 2048 frames. In high SNR regions however, such a large averaging size is unnecessary. In this paper, two techniques are proposed in order to reduce the averaging size. The first technique measures the average noise power and selects an efficient frame averaging length using a noise look-up-table (LUT). The second technique uses a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to determine if sufficient performance is achievable with the averaging size. Performance results show that the size of the averaging window can be reduced whilst maintaining a target BER. The noise LUT adaptive scheme has been implemented in hardware and we describe the real-time behavior.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7166144/7224736/07224920.pdf","startPage":"533","endPage":"541","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Advanced Communication Technology (ICACT)","doi":"10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACT.2015.7224920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7224736","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7224920","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency offset estimation for satellite communications with adaptive frame averaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Frequency estimation","Noise","Bit error rate","Estimation","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic redundancy check codes","digital video broadcasting","frequency estimation","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite channel","average noise power","efficient frame averaging length","noise look-up-table","cyclic redundancy check","averaging window","hardware prototype","enhanced poly-polarization multiplexing system","digital video broadcasting","modified Luise and Reggiannini algorithm","adaptive frame averaging","satellite communications","frequency offset estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["satellite communications","polarization multiplexing","frequency offset estimation","latency reduction","performance investigation","hardware implementation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7224920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-3 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Frequency offset estimation for satellite communications with adaptive frame averaging","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7224920/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15401732","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"1-3 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency offset estimation for satellite communications with adaptive frame averaging","confLoc":"PyeongChang, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"044J01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06482S","chronDate":"1-3 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7166144","isNumber":"7224736","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7166144","xplore-issue":"7224736","articleId":"7224920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Global IT Research Institute (GiRI)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7225093,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Tan","affiliation":["University at Buffalo - The State University of New York, Buffalo, NY, US"],"bio":{"p":["Xin Tan (xtan3@buffalo.edu) received his B.S. degree in automation from the Beijing Institute of Technology, China, and his M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2011 and 2013, respectively.

The key challenge to realize WUSNs is the wireless communication in underground environments. Most existing wireless communication systems utilize a dipole antenna to transmit and receive propagating electromagnetic (EM) waves, a method that does not work well in underground environments due to the high material absorption loss. The magnetic induction (MI) technique provides a promising alternative solution that could address the current problem in underground environments. Although MI-based underground communication has been intensively investigated theoretically, little effort has been made so far to develop a testbed for MI-based underground communication that can validate the theoretical results. In this article, a testbed of several MI-based communication systems is designed and implemented in an in-lab underground environment. The testbed realizes and tests not only the original MI mechanism utilizing a single coil but also recently developed techniques that use the MI waveguide and threedirectional (3D) MI coils. The experiments are conducted in an in-lab underground environment with reconfigurable environmental parameters, such as soil composition and water content. This article provides the principles and guidelines for developing the MI underground communication testbed, which is very complicated and time consuming due to the new communication mechanism and the new wireless transmission medium.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225093/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15484781","htmlLink":"/document/7225093/","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Underground Sensor Networks: MI-based communication systems for underground applications.","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation and State University of New York at Buffalo","grantNumber":"1320758"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Underground Sensor Networks: MI-based communication systems for underground applications.","sourcePdf":"57map04-tan-2453917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067472S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"74","isNumber":"7274800","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7274800","articleId":"7225093","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7225097,"authors":[{"name":"Tiago M.

Compared to conventional double-sideband DD systems, in which the amplitude shape of the optical filter is quasi-symmetric relative to the centre of the signal spectrum, ultra-dense optical SSB-MB-OFDM networks employing virtual carrier-assisted DD are differently affected by the phase-to-intensity conversion. This is due to the detuned BS required by these networks, which modify the converted phase noise (CPN) features. A reduction of the power spectral density of the CPN achieving 30 dB can occur along the frequency range in which the BS bandwidth and detuning lead to a filtering attenuation that is similar in both sides of the virtual carrier. For single band, when the ratio between the BS detuning and bandwidth increases from 0% to 28%, an error vector magnitude improvement of 7 dB due to the CPN reduction is observed. The optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) penalty due to the laser phase noise in 112-Gb/s SSB-MB-OFDM networks comprising 12 OFDM bands and employing an ultra-dense band spacing of 3.125 GHz is lower than 1 dB for external cavity lasers and is 1.6 dB for distributed feedback lasers. These OSNR penalties are obtained for an optimized ratio between the BS detuning and bandwidth of 14%.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2461013","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7225204/07225097.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2461013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225204","startPage":"4093","endPage":"4100","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Carrier-Assisted Direct-Detection MB-OFDM Next-Generation Ultra-Dense Metro Networks Limited by Laser Phase Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Carrier-Assisted Direct-Detection MB-OFDM Next-Generation Ultra-Dense Metro Networks Limited by Laser Phase Noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.1, 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225097/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"19","publicationDate":"1 Oct.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15430438","dateOfInsertion":"04 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225097/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"MORFEUS-PTDC/EEI-TEL/2573/2012 and UID/EEA/50008/2013"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Carrier-Assisted Direct-Detection MB-OFDM Next-Generation Ultra-Dense Metro Networks Limited by Laser Phase Noise","sourcePdf":"jlt-alves-2461013-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073387S","chronDate":"Oct.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7225204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7225204","articleId":"7225097","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225098,"authors":[{"name":"Biao Sun","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"p":["Biao Sun, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085740293"},{"name":"Zhilin Zhang","affiliation":["Samsung Research America\u2013Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Zhilin Zhang, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Zhilin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085431447"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-437X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1748"},{"format":"CD","value":"2379-9153"}],"articleNumber":"7225098","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1763},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Sensors Council","url":"http://www.ieee-sensors.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heart rate","Acceleration","Sensors","Monitoring","Bayes methods","Signal processing algorithms","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","cardiology","decision theory","least mean squares methods","medical signal processing","motion compensation","photoplethysmography","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["photoplethysmography","PPG based heart rate monitoring","asymmetric least squares spectrum subtraction","Bayesian decision theory","motion artifacts","interference sources","wearable PPG signals","heart rate estimation","physiological parameters","SPECTRAP","motion tolerant HR estimation","simultaneous acceleration signal","PPG signal spectra","MA spectral components","PPG spectrum","spectrum subtraction algorithm","pattern classification problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Photoplethysmography (PPG)","Heart rate","Motion artifacts","Asymmetric least squares","Spectrum subtraction","Bayesian decision theory"]},{"kwd":["Photoplethysmography (PPG)","heart rate","motion artifacts","asymmetric least squares","spectrum subtraction","Bayesian decision theory"]}],"abstract":"Motion artifacts (MAs) are strong interference sources in wearable photoplethysmography (PPG) signals, significantly affecting estimation of heart rate (HR) and other physiological parameters. In this paper, a novel method called SPECTRAP is proposed for accurate motion-tolerant estimation of HR using a PPG signal and a simultaneous acceleration signal. The method first calculates the spectra of the PPG signal and the acceleration signal, and then removes the MA spectral components from the PPG spectrum using a new spectrum subtraction algorithm. The new spectrum subtraction algorithm is based on asymmetric least square and overcomes drawbacks of the conventional spectrum subtraction algorithms. To find the spectral peak corresponding to HR on the resulting spectrum, SPECTRAP formulates the problem into a pattern classification problem and uses the Bayesian decision theory to solve it. Experimental results on the PPG database used in 2015 IEEE Signal Processing Cup showed that the proposed algorithm has excellent performance. The average absolute error on the twelve training sets was 1.50 beat per minute (BPM) (standard deviation: 1.95 BPM). The average absolute error on the ten testing sets was 2.13 BPM (standard deviation: 2.77 BPM).","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2473697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7286895/07225098.pdf","startPage":"7161","endPage":"7168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2473697","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photoplethysmography-Based Heart Rate Monitoring Using Asymmetric Least Squares Spectrum Subtraction and Bayesian Decision Theory","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225098","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225098/","displayDocTitle":"Photoplethysmography-Based Heart Rate Monitoring Using Asymmetric Least Squares Spectrum Subtraction and Bayesian Decision Theory","volume":"15","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15518941","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225098/","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Programs Foundation through the Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20120032110068"},{"fundingName":"Tianjin Key Technology Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"14ZCZDS F00025"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271321, 61401303 and 61473207"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photoplethysmography-Based Heart Rate Monitoring Using Asymmetric Least Squares Spectrum Subtraction and Bayesian Decision Theory","sourcePdf":"jsen-zhang-2473697-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083442S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7286895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"7286895","articleId":"7225098","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225102,"authors":[{"name":"Ric A.

We specifically consider legacy communication systems as opposed to cooperative communication systems to address the ever present problem of legacy technologies. This radar waveform is able to share the spectrum with the existing communication systems such that its detection performance is not compromised while trying to help the legacy systems maintain their own symbol error rates (SERs). We show with various scenarios that the spectrally shaped radar waveform outperforms the traditional wideband pulse waveform in terms of detection performance with the communication signals acting as interference to the radar. Moreover, SERs of the legacy systems employing quaternary phase-shift keying modulation in the presence of the shaped radar waveform (acting as interference) outperform SERs of systems under traditional radar pulse interference. These SERs are very close to theoretical noise-only SERs.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2473169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07225102.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2473169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","startPage":"1541","endPage":"1554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Friendly Spectrally Shaped Radar Waveform With Legacy Communication Systems for Shared Access and Spectrum Management","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Friendly Spectrally Shaped Radar Waveform With Legacy Communication Systems for Shared Access and Spectrum Management","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15443730","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225102/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Friendly Spectrally Shaped Radar Waveform With Legacy Communication Systems for Shared Access and Spectrum Management","sourcePdf":"access-romero-2473169-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067932S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7225102","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225112,"authors":[{"name":"Hsueh-Yen Yang","affiliation":["National Taiwan University, Graduate Institute of Electronics Eng., Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9425/7398198/7225112/7225112-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hsueh-Yen Yang received the M.S. degree in electronic engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan, in 2008, and is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering from National Taiwan University (NTU), Taipei, Taiwan.","He was with the Integrated System Laboratory of NTU, Taiwan, from 2002.

Therefore, reversible data hiding (RDH) in JPEG images is important and useful for many applications such as archive management and image authentication. However, RDH in JPEG images is considerably more difficult than that in uncompressed images because there is less information redundancy in JPEG images than that in uncompressed images, and any modification in the compressed domain may introduce more distortion in the host image. Furthermore, along with the embedding capacity and fidelity (visual quality), which have to be considered for uncompressed images, the storage size of the marked JPEG file should be considered. In this paper, based on the philosophy behind the JPEG encoder and the statistical properties of discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients, we present some basic insights into how to select quantized DCT coefficients for RDH. Then, a new histogram shifting-based RDH scheme for JPEG images is proposed, in which the zero coefficients remain unchanged and only coefficients with values 1 and -1 are expanded to carry message bits. Moreover, a block selection strategy based on the number of zero coefficients in each 8 \u00d7 8 block is proposed, which can be utilized to adaptively choose DCT coefficients for data hiding. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the proposed method we can easily realize high embedding capacity and good visual quality. The storage size of the host JPEG file can also be well preserved.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2473235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7558256/07225117.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2473235","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7558256","startPage":"1610","endPage":"1621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reversible Data Hiding in JPEG Images","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225117","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reversible Data Hiding in JPEG Images","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225117/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16283108","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7225117/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003606","fundingName":"Korea Foundation for Advanced Studies' International Scholar Exchange Fellowship for the academic year of 2013-2014"},{"fundingName":"973 Program of China","grantNumber":"2011CB302204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61173147, U1135001 and 61332012"},{"fundingName":"Korean National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"2015R1A2A2A01004587"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"GJHZ20140418191518323"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reversible Data Hiding in JPEG Images","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-huang-2473235-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074987S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7558256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7558256","articleId":"7225117","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225118,"authors":[{"name":"Edmund K.

However, few works studied how the attacker should optimize its attack schedule in order to maximize the effect on the system performance due to the insufficiency of energy at the attacker side. This paper fills this gap from the aspect of control system performance. We consider the optimal jamming attack that maximizes the Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control cost function under energy constraint. After analyzing the properties of the cost function under an arbitrary attack schedule, we derive the optimal jamming attack schedule and the corresponding cost function. System stability under this optimal attack schedule is also considered. We further investigate the optimal attack schedule in a WNCS with multiple subsystems.

The idea behind uniform embedding is that, by uniformly spreading the embedding modifications to the quantized discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients of all possible magnitudes, the average changes of the first-order and the second-order statistics can be possibly minimized, which leads to less statistical detectability. The purpose of this paper is to refine the uniform embedding by considering the relative changes of statistical model for digital images, aiming to make the embedding modifications to be proportional to the coefficient of variation. Such a new strategy can be regarded as generalized uniform embedding in substantial sense. Compared with the original uniform embedding distortion (UED), the proposed method uses all the DCT coefficients (including the DC, zero, and non-zero AC coefficients) as the cover elements. We call the corresponding distortion function uniform embedding revisited distortion (UERD), which incorporates the complexities of both the DCT block and the DCT mode of each DCT coefficient (i.e., selection channel), and can be directly derived from the DCT domain. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified with the evidence obtained from the exhaustive experiments using a popular steganalyzer with rich models on the BOSSbase database. The proposed UERD gains a significant performance improvement in terms of secure embedding capacity when compared with the original UED, and rivals the current state-of-the-art with much reduced computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2473815","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7277179/07225122.pdf","startPage":"2669","endPage":"2680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2473815","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7277179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225122","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Statistical Image Model for JPEG Steganography: Uniform Embedding Revisited","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using Statistical Image Model for JPEG Steganography: Uniform Embedding Revisited","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"10","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225122/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15484835","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Key Program through the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong","grantNumber":"S2012020011114"},{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20120171110037"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61379156 and 60970145"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Statistical Image Model for JPEG Steganography: Uniform Embedding Revisited","sourcePdf":"tifs-ni-2473815-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061477S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7277179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"7277179","articleId":"7225122","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":7225123,"authors":[{"name":"Jong Yeol Ryu","affiliation":["Information Systems Technology and Design Pillar, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jong Yeol","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37533927600"},{"name":"Jemin Lee","affiliation":["iTrust, Centre for Research in Cyber Security, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Jemin","lastName":"Lee","id":"37406236800"},{"name":"Tony Q.

Because the characteristic modes of a radiator represent its complete set of possible responses to an excitation, any port on the antenna must display the properties of a combination of one or more of these characteristic modes. By restricting our consideration to a class of symmetric antennas, the lowest order characteristic modes of a structure can be separated with practical decoupling networks, studied, and excited independently. We show that the quality factor of each characteristic mode effectively bounds the performance of any individual port excitation, and can be used to evaluate the fitness of the antenna for multiport excitation. Under this framework, we apply a genetic algorithm (GA) to synthesize low Q MIMO antennas while minimizing conductor area. Feed locations are specified on the optimized shape based on the weighted excitation strength of the desired modes, and a two-port MIMO antenna is implemented and measured, verifying the proposed theory.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2473703","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7503542/07225124.pdf","startPage":"2668","endPage":"2678","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2473703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7503542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Shape Optimization of Symmetric MIMO Antennas Using Characteristic Modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225124","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225124/","displayDocTitle":"Systematic Shape Optimization of Symmetric MIMO Antennas Using Characteristic Modes","volume":"64","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16123286","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225124/","dateOfInsertion":"04 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1343309"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic Shape Optimization of Symmetric MIMO Antennas Using Characteristic Modes","sourcePdf":"tap-adams-2473703-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087026S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7503542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7503542","articleId":"7225124","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225125,"authors":[{"name":"Yunlong Zhan","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Wireless Sensor Network and Communication, Shanghai Institute of Microsystem and Information Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7558256/7225125/zhan-2473375-small.gif","p":["Yunlong Zhan (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2011.

Therefore, we present a novel image-guided stereo matching algorithm, which employs the efficient combined matching cost and multistep disparity refinement, to improve the accuracy of existing local stereo matching algorithms. Different from all the other methods, we introduce a guidance image for the whole algorithm. This filter-based guidance image is generated by extracting the enhanced information from the raw stereo image. The combined matching cost consists of the novel double-RGB gradient, the improved lightweight census transform, and the image color. This cost measurement is robust against image noise and textureless regions in computing the matching cost. Furthermore, a new systemic multistep refinement process, which includes outlier classification, four-direction propagation, leftmost propagation, and an exponential step filter, is proposed to remove the outliers in the raw disparity map. Experiments on the Middlebury benchmark demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance that it ranks first among the 158 submitted algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method is also robust on the 30 Middlebury data sets and the real-world Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Toyota Technological Institute benchmark.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2473375","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7558256/07225125.pdf","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1645","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2473375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7558256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate Image-Guided Stereo Matching With Efficient Matching Cost and Disparity Refinement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Accurate Image-Guided Stereo Matching With Efficient Matching Cost and Disparity Refinement","volume":"26","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2016","accessionNumber":"16283101","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7225125/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Strategic Priority Research Program through the Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"XDA06020300"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate Image-Guided Stereo Matching With Efficient Matching Cost and Disparity Refinement","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-zhan-2473375-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112732S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7558256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7558256","articleId":"7225125","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":7225130,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Lei","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Center for Biometrics and Security Research, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7558256/7225130/lei-2473415-small.gif","p":["Zhen Lei (M'11) received the B.S. degree in automation from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2010.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Compared with the hand-crafted features, learning-based features are considered to be able to exploit information with better discriminative ability for specific tasks. Motivated by the recent success of deep learning, in this paper, we extend the original shallow face descriptors to deep discriminant face features by introducing a stacked image descriptor (SID). With deep structure, more complex facial information can be extracted and the discriminant and compactness of feature representation can be improved. The SID is learned in a forward optimization way, which is computational efficient compared with deep learning. Extensive experiments on various face databases are conducted to show that SID is able to achieve high face recognition performance with compact face representation, compared with other state-of-the-art descriptors.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7558256/07225130.pdf","startPage":"1685","endPage":"1696","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2473415","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2473415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7558256","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225130","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning Stacked Image Descriptor for Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Face","Face recognition","Feature extraction","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Principal component analysis","Convolution","Tensile stress"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","image representation","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning stacked image descriptor","face recognition performance","learning-based face descriptors","hand-crafted features","learning-based features","deep learning","shallow-face descriptors","deep-discriminant face features","facial information extraction","feature representation","SID","compact face representation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Deep discriminant face representation","face recognition","learning-based descriptor","stacked image descriptor (SID)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Learning Stacked Image Descriptor for Face Recognition","volume":"26","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7225130/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16283107","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Chinese National Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"61572501, 61375037, 61473291 and 61572536"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Support Program","grantNumber":"2013BAK02B01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002367","fundingName":"Chinese Academy of Sciences","grantNumber":"KGZD-EW-102-2"},{"fundingName":"AuthenMetric Research and Development Funds"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning Stacked Image Descriptor for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-lei-2473415-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142949S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7558256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7558256","articleId":"7225130","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225135,"authors":[{"name":"Qiubo Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7558256/7225135/chen-2473255-small.gif","p":["Qiubo Chen received the B.S. degree from the Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree with the Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics.","His research interests include image and video processing, coding, and associated very-large-scale integration design."]},"firstName":"Qiubo","lastName":"Chen","id":"38551384200"},{"name":"Hongbin Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7558256/7225135/sun-2473255-small.gif","p":["Hongbin Sun (M\u201911) received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2003 and 2009, respectively.","He was a Visiting Ph.D. Student with the Electrical, Computer and Systems Engineering Department, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, USA, from 2007 to 2008.

Compared with New Edge-Directed Interpolation (NEDI) based implicit edge directional upscaling, explicit methods require less computational resource and more easily reach real-time performance, especially when the required image definition and upscaling ratio are very high. Nevertheless, the investigation of applications of explicit methods in video processing systems remains largely missing arguably because it is commonly believed that explicit edge-directed interpolation tends to introduce unexpected artifacts because of inaccurate detection and hence its image quality is relatively poor. This paper proposes an explicit edge-directed adaptive interpolation method that leverages more sophisticated edge detection and orientation estimation algorithms to avoid misinterpolation, thereby providing similar or even better image quality than those with implicit methods. Targeting the real-time 4K video display system, the proposed edge-directed image upscaling algorithm is further implemented with an efficient very-large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed interpolation algorithm outperforms previous explicit and implicit edge-directed methods in both objective and subjective tests. The presented VLSI implementation further demonstrates that the maximum output video sequence of the proposed interpolation method can reach 4k \u00d7 2k@60 Hz with a reasonable hardware cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16283106","htmlLink":"/document/7225135/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Algorithm and VLSI Architecture of Edge-Directed Image Upscaling for 4k Display System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project, China","grantNumber":"2013ZX01033001-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm and VLSI Architecture of Edge-Directed Image Upscaling for 4k Display System","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-sun-2473255-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092444S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7558256","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7558256","articleId":"7225135","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225139,"authors":[{"name":"Haitong Li","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Peking University, Beijing, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7272173/7225139/li-2468602-small.gif","p":["Haitong Li (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2015.","He is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.

A systematic study on the intrinsic switching behaviors and optimization of 3-D RRAM arrays is performed, combining device measurements and 3-D array simulations. The dependence of programming voltage on array size, cell location and pulse parameters, statistical properties of operating 3-D RRAM arrays, and subthreshold disturbance on RRAM cells is experimentally investigated. Optimization guidelines for the performance and reliability of 3-D RRAM arrays from device level to architecture level are presented: 1) an optimized 1/n architecture for 100-kb 3-D RRAM arrays can improve write margin by 69.6% and reduce energy consumption by 75.6% compared with a conventional full-size array design; 2) a strategy of prioritizing storage location for reliable operation is presented; and 3) an optimal hopping barrier of oxygen ions is found to improve array immunity to disturbance.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2468602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2468602","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7272173/07225139.pdf","startPage":"3160","endPage":"3167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3-D Resistive Memory Arrays: From Intrinsic Switching Behaviors to Optimization Guidelines","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"3-D Resistive Memory Arrays: From Intrinsic Switching Behaviors to Optimization Guidelines","volume":"62","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2015","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15457263","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225139/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"2011CBA00600"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China Program","grantNumber":"61421005, 61334007 and 61404006"},{"fundingName":"Member Companies through the Stanford Non-Volatile Memory Technology Research Initiative, STARnet SONIC, the NCN-NEEDS Program within the National Science Foundation, and by Semiconductor Research Corporation","grantNumber":"1227020-EEC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"NSF-CCF-1449653"},{"fundingName":"Undergraduate Visiting Research Program, School of Engineering, Stanford University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3-D Resistive Memory Arrays: From Intrinsic Switching Behaviors to Optimization Guidelines","sourcePdf":"ted-li-2468602-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090881S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7272173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7272173","articleId":"7225139","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7225143,"authors":[{"name":"Shengda Chen","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7723941/7225143/chen-2473436-small.gif","p":["Shengda Chen received the B.S. degree in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2013, where he is currently working toward the master\u2019s degree in computer science and technology.","His research interests include multimedia forensics and information security."]},"firstName":"Shengda","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085688906"},{"name":"Shunquan Tan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Media Security, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7723941/7225143/tan-2473436-small.gif","p":["Shunquan Tan (M\u201910) received the B.S. degree in computational mathematics and applied software and the Ph.D. degree in computer software and theory from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2002 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Lecturer with the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.

However, less attention has been paid to video forensics. Research on video forensics, and especially on automatic detection of object-based video forgery, is still in its infancy. In this paper, we develop an approach for automatic identification and forged segment localization of object-based forged video encoded with advanced frameworks. The proposed approach starts with a frame manipulation detector. An automatic algorithm is proposed to identify object-based video forgery based on the frame manipulation detector. Then, a two-stage automatic algorithm is provided to accurately locate the forged video segments in the suspicious video. To construct the proposed frame manipulation detector, motion residuals are generated from the target video frame sequence. We regard the object-based forgery in video frames as image tampering in the motion residuals and employ the feature extractors that are originally built for still image steganalysis to extract forensic features from the motion residuals. The experiments show that the proposed approach achieves excellent results in both forged video identification and automatic forged temporal segment localization.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2473436","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7723941/07225143.pdf","startPage":"2138","endPage":"2151","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2473436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7723941","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Detection of Object-Based Forgery in Advanced Video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225143","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225143/","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Detection of Object-Based Forgery in Advanced Video","volume":"26","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16425694","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225143/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61332012, 61402295 and 61572329"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030313557"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"GJHZ20140418191518323 and JCYJ20140418182819173"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Detection of Object-Based Forgery in Advanced Video","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-tan-2473436-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159432S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7723941","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7723941","articleId":"7225143","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225149,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhe Du","affiliation":["School of Information and Engineering, Communication University of China, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianhe","lastName":"Du","id":"37085733689"},{"name":"Chaowei Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chaowei","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37289485100"},{"name":"Zhongwei Hu","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongwei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085727534"},{"name":"Heyun Lin","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Heyun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085728564"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7225149","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":394},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Relays","MIMO","Channel estimation","Joints","Tensile stress","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cooperative communication","MIMO communication","precoding","radio receivers","relay networks (telecommunication)","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-hop cooperative MIMO relay systems","tensor-based receiver","joint symbol estimation","channel estimation","multiple-input multiple-output systems","source node","transmit signal design","linear constellation precoding","time-domain spreading","received signal","destination node","fourth-order tensor","nested parallel factor model","PARAFAC model","channel state information","channel parameters","transmitted symbols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Tensor-based receiver","MIMO relay","nested PARAFAC model"]},{"kwd":["Tensor-based receiver","MIMO relay","fourth-order tensor","nested PARAFAC model"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we develop a novel tensor-based receiver for two-hop cooperative multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay systems.

However, previous work only considers the energy saving of mobile devices while ignoring the execution delay of mobile applications. To reduce the energy consumption of mobile devices, one may offload as many mobile applications as possible. However, offloading to cloud servers may incur a large execution delay because of the waiting time at the servers or the communication delay from the mobile devices to the servers. Thus, to balance the tradeoff between energy consumption and execution delay of mobile applications, it is necessary to determine whether the mobile application should be offloaded to the cloud server or run locally at the mobile devices. In this paper, we first formulate a joint optimization problem, which minimizes both the energy consumption at the mobile devices and the execution delay of mobile applications. We prove that the proposed problem is NP-hard. For a special case with unlimited residual energy at the mobile device and the same amount of resources required by each mobile application, we present a polynomial-time optimal solution. We also propose an efficient heuristic algorithm to solve the general case of the problem. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7959216/07225153.pdf","startPage":"858","endPage":"867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2015.2466617","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2015.2466617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7959216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy and Delay Tradeoff for Application Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy and Delay Tradeoff for Application Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225153/","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225153/","dateOfInsertion":"26 June 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16992933","volume":"11","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61300212, 61202378 and 61301102"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014T70544"},{"fundingName":"Application Foundation Research of Suzhou of China","grantNumber":"SYG201401"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy and Delay Tradeoff for Application Offloading in Mobile Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"jsyst-wang-2466617-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09798S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7959216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7959216","articleId":"7225153","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225155,"authors":[{"name":"Hussein Mnyusiwalla","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Complex Systems, Poitiers University, Futuroscope, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7469897/7225155/mnyus-2468678-small.gif","p":["Hussein Mnyusiwalla received the M.S. degree in computer science from the University of Poitiers, Poitiers, France, and the engineering degree in mechanics and avionics from \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure de M\u00e9canique et d\u2019A\u00e9rotechnique, University of Poitiers in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in robotics with the ROBIOSS Laboratory, PPRIME Institute CNRS UPR 3346.","His current research interests include grasping and dexterous manipulation with robotic hands."]},"firstName":"Hussein","lastName":"Mnyusiwalla","id":"37085796960"},{"name":"Philippe Vulliez","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering and Complex Systems, Poitiers University, Futuroscope, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7469897/7225155/vulli-2468678-small.gif","p":["Philippe Vulliez received the engineering degree from the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Cachan, Cachan, France, in 1981, and the M.S. degree from the Laboratoire de M\u00e9canique et Technologie, Cachan, France, both in mechanical engineering.

It has been developed with the aim to replicate fine manipulation with fingertips with a high degree of interaction with the environment. This paper proposes to realize a robotic hand for inside-hand fine manipulation and adaptive grasping. The robotic hand is equipped with fingers whose design is based on a human anatomical finger model. Thus, several fingers can be assembled for building a human-sized dexterous hand with an anthropomorphic look. The modular design offers the ability to choose the number of fingers to be used as well as to adjust finger placement based on the manipulation task requirement. The tendon-based actuation presents a routing of the tendons that minimizes friction, kinematic, and static coupling between different finger axes in the transmission from motors to joints. Unlike many existing robotic hands, including our first anthropomorphic hand, we address the difficulties by decoupling joint motions with a new solution for the universal joint at the base of the finger. The results obtained demonstrate an excellent dynamic behavior and accuracy of the finger motion. Finally, the new finger design led to the development of a fully actuated mechanical hand with four fingers and with 16 DOF: the ROBIOSS hand. The hand was embedded on an industrial robot. A manipulation task that uses simultaneously abduction-adduction motion and flexion-extension motion of the finger demonstrates the potential of the hand for accurate manipulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Dexterous Hand Based on Bio-Inspired Finger Design for Inside-Hand Manipulation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2015.2468678","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7469897/07225155.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2015.2468678","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7469897","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225155","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225155/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"A New Dexterous Hand Based on Bio-Inspired Finger Design for Inside-Hand Manipulation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7225155/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15989055","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French Government Research Program \u201cInvestissements d\u2019Avenir\u201d through the Robotex Equipment of Excellence","grantNumber":"ANR-10-EQPX-44"},{"fundingName":"Poitou-Charentes Region 2007\u20132013 (program project ten images and interactivities), in partnership with the European Union [European Regional Development Fund (FEDER/ERDF)]."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Dexterous Hand Based on Bio-Inspired Finger Design for Inside-Hand Manipulation","sourcePdf":"tsmc-gazeau-2468678-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069883S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7469897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7469897","articleId":"7225155","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7225158,"authors":[{"name":"Sinan Kaplan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Lappeenranta University of Technology, Istanbul, Turkey"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7330243/7225158/kapla-2462084-small.gif","p":["\n\nSinan Kaplan was born in Sivas, Turkey, in 1990.

Therefore, researchers have been working for more than a decade on designing driver inattention monitoring systems. As a result, several detection techniques for the detection of both drowsiness and distraction have been proposed in the literature. Some of these techniques were successfully adopted and implemented by the leading car companies. This paper discusses and provides a comprehensive insight into the well-established techniques for driver inattention monitoring and introduces the use of most recent and futuristic solutions exploiting mobile technologies such as smartphones and wearable devices. Then, a proposal is made for the active of such systems into car-to-car communication to support vehicular ad hoc network's (VANET's) primary aim of safe driving. We call this approach the dissemination of driver behavior via C2C communication. Throughout this paper, the most remarkable studies of the last five years were examined thoroughly in order to reveal the recent driver monitoring techniques and demonstrate the basic pros and cons. In addition, the studies were categorized into two groups: driver drowsiness and distraction. Then, research on the driver drowsiness was further divided into two main subgroups based on the exploitation of either visual features or nonvisual features. A comprehensive compilation, including used features, classification methods, accuracy rates, system parameters, and environmental details, was represented as tables to highlight the (dis)advantages and/or limitations of the aforementioned categories. A similar approach was also taken for the methods used for the detection of driver distraction.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2462084","startPage":"3017","endPage":"3032","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7330243/07225158.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2462084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Driver Behavior Analysis for Safe Driving: A Survey","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wearable sensors","Fatigue","Smart phones","Monitoring","Vehicle ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver information systems","feature extraction","image classification","mobile computing","object detection","road accidents","road safety","road traffic","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver behavior analysis","safe driving","driver drowsiness detection","driver distraction detection","traffic accidents","financial losses","driver inattention monitoring systems","car companies","mobile technologies","smartphones","wearable devices","car-to-car communication","vehicular ad hoc network","VANET","driver behavior dissemination","C2C communication","visual features","classification methods","system parameters","environmental details"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Car-to-car communication","driver behavior dissemination","driver fatigue detection","driver inattention monitoring","smartphone","wearable devices"]},{"kwd":["Car-to-car communication","driver behavior dissemination","driver fatigue detection","driver inattention monitoring","smartphone","wearable devices"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225158/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Driver Behavior Analysis for Safe Driving: A Survey","volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7225158/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15618553","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Yildiz Technical University Scientific Research Projects Coordination Department","grantNumber":"2013-04-01-GEP01"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver Behavior Analysis for Safe Driving: A Survey","sourcePdf":"tits-guvensan-2462084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168067S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7330243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"166","xplore-issue":"7330243","articleId":"7225158","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-15"},{"_id":7225160,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhua Sun","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, ChangSha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/71/7488924/7225160/sun-2473166-small.gif","p":["Jianhua Sun received the PhD degree in computer science from the\n Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2005.

A core challenge and enabling technique in implementing redundancy elimination is to perform content-based chunking, which typically involves the computationally heavy Rabin fingerprinting algorithm. In this paper, we propose a GPU-based implementation of Rabin fingerprinting to address this issue. To maximize performance gains, a diverse set of optimization strategies, such as efficient buffer management, GPU memory hierarchy optimization, and balanced load distribution, is proposed by either exploiting the intrinsic hardware features or addressing domain-specific challenges. Extensive evaluations on both the overall and microscopic performance reveal the effectiveness of the GPU-accelerated Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, and we can achieve up to 40 Gpbs throughput on a GTX 780 card. The throughput shows 1.87\u00d7 speedup against the state-of-the-art using comparable hardware. In addition, although some optimization designs are specific for the problem, techniques proposed in this work including the indexed compact buffer scheme and approximate sorting would also be beneficial and applicable to other network applications leveraging GPU acceleration.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2015.2473166","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7488924/07225160.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2015.2473166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7488924","startPage":"2130","endPage":"2142","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Redundant Network Traffic Elimination with GPU Accelerated Rabin Fingerprinting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Redundant Network Traffic Elimination with GPU Accelerated Rabin Fingerprinting","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16070203","dateOfInsertion":"10 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7225160/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272190, 61572179 and 61173166"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Redundant Network Traffic Elimination with GPU Accelerated Rabin Fingerprinting","sourcePdf":"tpds-chen-2473166-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079611S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7488924","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7488924","articleId":"7225160","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225166,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Lotfi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Denver, Denver, CO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hossein Lotfi (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the Master\u2019s degree in business administration from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2008 and 2010, respectively.

To overcome this limit, wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) have been proposed and studied extensively over the last few years. In a typical WRSN, batteries in sensor nodes can be replenished by a mobile charger that periodically travels along a certain trajectory in the sensing area. To maximize the charged energy in sensor nodes, one fundamental question is how to control the traveling velocity of the charger. In this paper, we first identify the optimal velocity control as a key design objective of mobile wireless charging in WRSNs. We then formulate the optimal charger velocity control problem on arbitrarily-shaped irregular trajectories in a 2D space. The problem is proved to be NP-hard, and hence a heuristic solution with a provable upper bound is developed using novel spatial and temporal discretization. We also derive the optimal velocity control for moving the charger along a linear (1D) trajectory commonly seen in many WSN applications. Extensive simulations show that the network lifetime can be extended by 2.5\u00d7 with the proposed velocity control mechanisms.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7484375/07225171.pdf","startPage":"1699","endPage":"1713","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2473163","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2473163","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225171","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Optimal Velocity Control for Mobile Charging in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Velocity control","Wireless sensor networks","Acceleration","Inductive charging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inductive power transmission","optimal control","optimisation","telecommunication control","velocity control","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["near optimal velocity control","mobile charging","wireless rechargeable sensor networks","traveling velocity control","optimal charger velocity control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless rechargeable sensor networks","velocity control","energy harvesting"]},{"kwd":["Wireless rechargeable sensor networks","velocity control","energy harvesting","mobile charging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225171/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Near-Optimal Velocity Control for Mobile Charging in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7225171/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16070182","dateOfInsertion":"07 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"2015CB352503"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61228302"},{"fundingName":"ZJSF","grantNumber":"LY14F030016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Optimal Velocity Control for Mobile Charging in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tmc-chen-2473163-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137326S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7484375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"7484375","articleId":"7225171","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7225172,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaozhe Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165391/7270370/7225172/xwang-2454333-small.gif","p":["\n               Xiaozhe Wang (S13M15) received the B.S. degree in information science and electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China, in 2010, and the M.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, in 2011 and 2015, respectively.","She was a Research Aid Intern with Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA, in 2014.

The energy-storage device is used as an inductor rather than a capacitive test object, thus ensuring that the energizing process is successful even during the test of a deeply deteriorated specimen.

Field channel measurements are crucial in characterizing wireless channel properties. Nevertheless, in spatial channel measurements, estimating the direction-of-arrivals (DoAs) of multipath components (MPCs) is a challenging issue, because of the large number of propagation paths and the correlation among the multipath signals. The number of incidence angles and estimation precision in traditional methods is limited by the sensor array size and signal correlation. In this paper, we propose a scheme for measuring and estimating the 2-D DoAs of propagation paths called multipath angular estimation using the array response of PN-sequences (MAPS). By using a receiving planar antenna array (PAA), MAPS first extracts the complex path array response vector (PARV) for each propagation path and then estimates the DoAs of the paths individually and independently. The subspace-decomposition theory for MAPS is proved and extensive simulations are conducted to compare MAPS with other algorithms. Furthermore, a channel sounder using two PAAs and the probing signal of 2.6 GHz carrier modulated by PN-sequences has been developed. The simulation and field tests show that MAPS can estimate arbitrary number of resolved MPCs in a channel snapshot and effectively suppress the multipath interference.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2473156","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","startPage":"341","endPage":"356","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07225180.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Dimensional DoA Estimation for Multipath Propagation Characterization Using the Array Response of PN-Sequences","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225180/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225180/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Two-Dimensional DoA Estimation for Multipath Propagation Characterization Using the Array Response of PN-Sequences","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697397","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University China"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Dimensional DoA Estimation for Multipath Propagation Characterization Using the Array Response of PN-Sequences","sourcePdf":"twc-cai-2473156-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118071S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7225180","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7225182,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Pyo Hong","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Pukyoung National University, Busan, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7225182/jhong-2473171-small.gif","p":["Jun-Pyo Hong (S\u201908\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree from the Information and Communications University, Daejeon, Korea, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the Korea Advance Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea, all in electrical engineering, in 2008, 2010 and 2014, respectively.

The cached data work as a buffer against the playback delay due to unstable wireless channels. Since the storage space for caching is limited while the number of video clips is tremendously large, a memory efficient caching strategy is important for maximizing the caching gain. We propose a user prefix caching scheme in a downlink network where each user caches an initial part (i.e., prefix) of each popular video to minimize the average playback delay. We derive closed-form expressions of the optimal prefix size and the corresponding average playback delay. Our results show the effects of system parameters on the average playback delay and provide an insightful guideline on memory-efficient caching. Moreover, in the scenarios where a constraint on tolerable delay is given, we derive the minimum storage space required at each user and the maximum number of supportable users at a base station in wireless caching networks, which provide a useful insight on designing wireless caching networks.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2473171","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07225182.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"388","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2473171","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User Prefix Caching for Average Playback Delay Reduction in Wireless Video Streaming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225182","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225182/","displayDocTitle":"User Prefix Caching for Average Playback Delay Reduction in Wireless Video Streaming","volume":"15","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697396","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225182/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT R&D Program of MSIP/IITP","grantNumber":"R-20150225-000437"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"User Prefix Caching for Average Playback Delay Reduction in Wireless Video Streaming","sourcePdf":"twc-choi-2473171-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065966S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7225182","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225184,"authors":[{"name":"Yueping Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong","Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7225184/yuewu-2473167-small.gif","p":["Yueping Wu (S\u201909\u2013M\u201913) received the B.Eng. degree in information and communication engineering from Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Kowloon, Hong Kong, in 2013.

This result is facilitated by a new asymptotic expression which we obtain for the cumulative distribution function of the maximum eigenvalue of a noncentral quadratic form in complex Gaussian matrices. Based on our analysis, we demonstrate that for a rank-1 line-of-sight (LoS) path, the interaction with the correlation matrices may yield improved or degraded performance. The relative effect depends largely on the geometric alignment of the LoS path with the eigenvectors of the correlation matrices. Generally speaking, when the LoS path aligns with the weak eigenvectors (i.e., those corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues), both a stronger LoS component, characterized by a higher Rician K factor, and a higher correlation lead to improved performance. In contrast, when the LoS path aligns with the strong eigenvectors, we demonstrate that there exists distinct regions for which increasing the Rician K factor has a beneficial or deleterious effect. Our results, in general, provide novel insight into how the mutual interactions of LoS and spatial correlation components impact the performance of MIMO-MRC systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asymptotic Outage Probability of MIMO-MRC Systems in Double-Correlated Rician Environments","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2473167","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07225184.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2473167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225184","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225184/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Asymptotic Outage Probability of MIMO-MRC Systems in Double-Correlated Rician Environments","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7225184/","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697427","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council","grantNumber":"616713"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005950","fundingName":"HKUST Research","grantNumber":"IGN13EG02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asymptotic Outage Probability of MIMO-MRC Systems in Double-Correlated Rician Environments","sourcePdf":"twc-wu-2473167-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088016S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7225184","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7225185,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Chen Chang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science, Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan","Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7225185/chang-2473165-small.gif","p":["Chin-Chen Chang (M\u201988\u2013SM\u201992\u2013F\u201999) received the Bachelor\u2019s degree in applied mathematics and Master\u2019s degree in computer and decision sciences from the National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the National Chiao Tung University.

To reduce insertion loss of the output matching network (OMN), an off-chip transformer is designed on a FR-4 printed circuit board (PCB). To minimize the area of the OMN, the transformer is embedded underneath the PA chip. Coupling between the PA and the transformer is minimized so that the performance is not affected. For the 7.5 dB peak-to-average power ratio, 16-QAM long-term evolution signal, the proposed CMOS PA module achieves a power-added efficiency of 38.5% and an adjacent channel leakage ratio level under -31 dBc at an average output power of 27.5 dBm. The proposed technique can be used in any wireless Tx applications requiring small form-factor and high performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225190/","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15488967","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CMOS Power Amplifier on Top of Embedded Transformer for Compact Module","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS Power Amplifier on Top of Embedded Transformer for Compact Module","sourcePdf":"lmwc-kim-2463222-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043722S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"7287814","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7287814","articleId":"7225190","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7225191,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Huang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Ministry of Education for Image Processing and Intelligent Control, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7287835/7225191/7225191-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Huang (M\u201907) graduated from Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 1997 and received the Master of Engineering degree and the Ph.D. degree from HUST in 2000 and 2005, respectively.","From 2006 to 2008, he was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Micro-Nano System Engineering and the Department of Mechano-Informatics and Systems, Nagoya University, Japan.

In this paper, an intention-guided control strategy is proposed and applied to an upper-limb power-assist exoskeleton. Meanwhile, a human-robot interface comprised of force-sensing resistors (FSRs) is designed to estimate the motion intention of the wearer's upper limb in real time. Moreover, a new concept called the \u201cintentional reaching direction (IRD)\u201d is proposed to quantitatively describe this intention. Both the state model and the observation model of IRD are obtained by studying the upper limb behavior modes and analyzing the relationship between the measured force signals and the motion intention. Based on these two models, the IRD can be inferred online using an adapted filtering technique. Guided by the inferred IRD, an admittance control strategy is deployed to control the motions of three DC motors placed at the corresponding joints of the robotic arm. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is finally confirmed by experiments on a 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) upper-limb robotic exoskeleton.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Exoskeletons","Admittance","Human-robot interaction","Force measurement","Robot sensing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","dexterous manipulators","force sensors","human-robot interaction","medical robotics","motion control","patient treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["upper-limb power-assist exoskeleton control","human-robot interface","motion intention recognition","power-assist robots","intention-guided control strategy","force-sensing resistors","FSR","intentional reaching direction concept","IRD concept","IRD state model","IRD observation model","adapted filtering technique","admittance control strategy","robotic arm","DC motor","direct current motors","motion control","upper-limb robotic exoskeleton"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Admittance control","human-robot interaction","motion intention","power-assist exoskeleton"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225191","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2015.2466634","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7287835/07225191.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2015.2466634","startPage":"1257","endPage":"1270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7287835","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control of Upper-Limb Power-Assist Exoskeleton Using a Human-Robot Interface Based on Motion Intention Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control of Upper-Limb Power-Assist Exoskeleton Using a Human-Robot Interface Based on Motion Intention Recognition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225191/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 August 2015","volume":"12","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7225191/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15489059","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"61473130"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0214"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control of Upper-Limb Power-Assist Exoskeleton Using a Human-Robot Interface Based on Motion Intention Recognition","sourcePdf":"tase-huang-2466634-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092809S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7287835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"7287835","articleId":"7225191","onlineDate":"26 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7225213,"authors":[{"name":"Harvey Glickenstein","bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10209/7225208/7225213/7225213-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Harvey Glickenstein"]},"firstName":"Harvey","lastName":"Glickenstein","id":"37888010900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-6072"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6080"}],"articleNumber":"7225213","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":456},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225213","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light rail systems","International collaboration","Maintenance engineering"]}],"abstract":"On 6 August 2014, Alstom and Huawei announced a long-term evolution (LTE) fourth-generation (4G) pilot for the metro market to demonstrate the performance of a multiservice broadband radio network for communications-based train control (CBTC).

Due to the complex and diverse nature of the environments which can expose attacks or terrorism activity, one must not only be able to deal with attacks that are dynamic, or constantly changing, but also take into account the structural aspects of the networks and the relationships among communication events. However, analyzing a massive, ever-growing graph will quickly overwhelm currently-available computing resources. One potential solution to the issue of handling very large graphs is to handle data as a \u201cstream\u201d. In this work, we present an approach to processing a stream of changes to the graph in order to efficiently identify any changes in the normative patterns and any changes in the anomalies to these normative patterns without processing all previous data. The overall framework of our approach is called PLADS for Pattern Learning and Anomaly Detection in Streams. We evaluate our approach on a dataset that represents people movements and actions, as well as a scalable, streaming data generator that represents social network behaviors, in order to assess the ability to efficiently detect known anomalies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Streaming data analytics for anomalies in graphs","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","doi":"10.1109/THS.2015.7225259","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172791/7190491/07225259.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2015.7225259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7190491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225259","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225259/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Streaming data analytics for anomalies in graphs","conferenceDate":"14-16 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225259/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15402005","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Streaming data analytics for anomalies in graphs","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"103StreamingDataEberle3551377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073624S","chronDate":"14-16 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172791","isNumber":"7190491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172791","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7190491","articleId":"7225259","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7225262,"authors":[{"name":"Ashwin Thangali","affiliation":["Vecna Technologies, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"Ashwin","lastName":"Thangali","id":"37299314200"},{"name":"Harsha Prasad","affiliation":["Vecna Technologies, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"Harsha","lastName":"Prasad","id":"37085625100"},{"name":"Sai Kethamakka","affiliation":["Vecna Technologies, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"Sai","lastName":"Kethamakka","id":"37085626100"},{"name":"David Demirdjian","affiliation":["Vecna Technologies, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Demirdjian","id":"37550175600"},{"name":"Neal Checka","affiliation":["Vecna Technologies, Cambridge, MA"],"firstName":"Neal","lastName":"Checka","id":"37282049700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1737-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-1736-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7225262","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225262","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Hidden Markov models","Target tracking","Training","Event detection","Computational modeling","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","learning (artificial intelligence)","software packages","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AESOP","adaptive event detection software","software tool","automatic event detection","supervised learning approach","event model construction","trajectory-based formulation","HMM","event detection algorithm","computationally efficient algorithms","event model training","stationary camera surveillance","aerial video footage"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents AESOP, a software tool for automatic event detection in video.

The proposed formulation is designed to accommodate events that involve interactions between two or more entities over an extended period of time.

The use of face recognition techniques has unique advantages when compared to other biometric methodologies - face images can be obtained from a distance and without the cooperation of the subject. A recent example demonstrating the growing need for such solution are the videos released by some terrorist organizations where the suspect's face is occluded with only the eyes being visible. Research has yielded several state-of-the-art algorithms but their accuracy is greatly lowered in the presence of various factors. Face recogition with arbitrary large face off-the-plane rotation remains one very challenging and open research problem. In order to build better face recognition algorithms, it is important to identify and analyze what and how factors affect the accuracy of said algorithms so these methods can be improved and made more robust. In our previous work we presented how factors such as image registration, number and type of training templates and the presence of varying amount of partial face information that can be used to improve the performance of three very popular widely used face recognition algorithms. In this paper, we examine how using multi-channel color images instead of their one-channel grayscale/color composite improves face recognition accuracy in the challenging case when face arbitrary large off-the-plane rotation is present. We demonstrate the improvement to face recognition accuracy through the very popular and widely used Eigenface-based, Fisherface-based and Direct Correlation-based algorithms. Our findings and experimental results with the data, show that when using frontal-facing images as external test images with frontal-facing images as training set images, the additional information contained in the multi-channel color images does not improve the composite gray-scale face recogntition accuracy. However, in the case where the algorithms are trained using only images with slight or considerable off-the-plane rotation, and externally tested either on frontal-facing images or images with arbitrary off-the-plane rotation, the information provided by the multi-channel color images boosts the face recognition accuracy for all three recognition algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/THS.2015.7225314","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Symposium on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7172791/7190491/07225314.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/THS.2015.7225314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7190491","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the effect of using non-composite multi-channel raw color images on face recognition accuracy with arbitrary large off-the-plane rotations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225314","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the effect of using non-composite multi-channel raw color images on face recognition accuracy with arbitrary large off-the-plane rotations","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225314/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15402053","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225314/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the effect of using non-composite multi-channel raw color images on face recognition accuracy with arbitrary large off-the-plane rotations","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"49AnalysisofVoynichkaMegherbi3560353.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071275S","chronDate":"14-16 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7172791","isNumber":"7190491","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7172791","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7190491","articleId":"7225314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7225334,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Karimian","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Karimian","id":"37085646006"},{"name":"Fatemeh Tehranipoor","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Tehranipoor","id":"37085636408"},{"name":"Md.

The micro-strip patch antenna may designed by using Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR). The micro strip antenna in its original design, resonates at 5.04 GHz. Further, the miniaturization of patch is achieved by loaded CSRR at ground plane to reduce resonating frequency. The size of single patch antenna is reduced by 76%. CSRR allows to decrease the resonator Q-factor easily without affecting any other parameters including shape and volume. The final design of patch antenna operates at 2.45 GHz by varying the CSRR. The radiation pattern, gain and return loss are measured.

DWT could be implemented using recursive Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering. DWT is a very effective analysis tool for many practical applications. Due to computational intensive nature because of multiply operations being a part of, real time processing of signals is being a tough task, as the implementations are not optimized. This paper describes implementation of DWT using Distributed Arithmetic Architecture (DAA) on FPGA device and a novel idea for implementation of Decimator function. The Low Pass FIR filters (LPF) and High Pass FIR filters (HPF) used in DWT are implemented using DAA. Simulations and syntheses are done with Virtex-5 XC5VLX20T-2FF323 FPGA device environment. Conventional Multiplier Architecture (CMA) based DWT system makes use of 8 high-cost resource DSP48Es for use of 8 8X8-bit multipliers, whereas DAA based DWT system makes use of only LUT slices. With CMA design, the maximum throughput achieved by the system is 1009.72Mbit/s, whereas DAA based system provides a throughput of 301.761Mbit/s, a metric which restricts DAA based DWT to low speed applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSTM.2015.7225436","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Smart Technologies and Management for Computing, Communication, Controls, Energy and Materials (ICSTM)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Smart Technologies and Management for Computing, Communication, Controls, Energy and Materials (ICSTM)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193753/7225373/07225436.pdf","startPage":"326","endPage":"330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225436/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of Discrete Wavelet Transform using Distributed Arithmetic Architecture","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15403395","htmlLink":"/document/7225436/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of Discrete Wavelet Transform using Distributed Arithmetic Architecture","confLoc":"Avadi, India","sourcePdf":"ccomm282.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049909S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193753","isNumber":"7225373","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193753","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7225373","articleId":"7225436","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7225457,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Newly, Maxout deep neural networks have conveyed substantial perfections to speech recognition systems. Hence, in this paper, a fully connected feed-forward neural network with Maxout units is introduced. The proposed deep neural network involves three hidden layers, 500 Maxout units and 2 neurons for each unit along with Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) as feature extraction of the phonemes waveforms. Further, the deep neural network is trained and tested over a corpus comprised of consonant Arabic phonemes recorded from 20 Malay speakers. Each person is required to pronounce the twenty eight consonant phonemes within the three chances given to each subjects articulate all the letters. Conversely, continuous recording has been established to record all the letters in each chance. The recording process is accomplished using SAMSON C03U USB multi-pattern condenser microphone. Here, the data are divided into five waveforms for training the proposed Maxout network and fifteen waveforms for testing. Experimentally, the proposed Dropout function for training has shown considerable performance over Sigmoid and Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) functions. Eventually, testing Maxout network has shown considerable outcome compare to Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the conventional feedforward neural network (NN) and Convolutional Auto-Encoder (CAE).","doi":"10.1109/CSPA.2015.7225644","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications (CSPA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 11th International Colloquium on Signal Processing & Its Applications (CSPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7175993/7225601/07225644.pdf","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225601","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSPA.2015.7225644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maxout based deep neural networks for Arabic phonemes recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225644/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Maxout based deep neural networks for Arabic phonemes recognition","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225644/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15402386","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maxout based deep neural networks for Arabic phonemes recognition","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"038ID66.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057078S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7175993","isNumber":"7225601","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7175993","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7225601","articleId":"7225644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7225657,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Most of the previous studies have been performed to address the braking behavior related problems based on the deterministic or stochastic parametric methods. However, these algorithms are of doubtful validity in the context of individual driving characteristics such as Perception-Reaction Time (PRT). This paper proposes a framework on Rear-end CWS to take into consideration of PRT effects based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Multi-layer perceptron neural network based rear-end collision warning algorithm (MCWA) is developed and evaluated through a comparison between the conventional algorithms such as Time To Collision (TTC) and Stopping Distance Algorithm (SDA). The comparison study demonstrates that the proposed algorithm outperforms other traditional algorithms for detecting and predicting the rear-end collision risks. The proposed algorithm could be used for rear-end collision warning in car-following case without the influence of different human PRT.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225657","startPage":"24","endPage":"30","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225657.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on the rear-end collision warning system by considering different perception-reaction time using multi-layer perceptron neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Prediction algorithms","Acceleration","Artificial neural networks","Safety","Neurons","Alarm systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","braking","multilayer perceptrons","road accidents","road safety","road traffic","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rear-end collision warning system","perception-reaction time","multilayer perceptron neural network","collision risk mitigation","frontal motor vehicle","traffic conditions","braking behavior","driving characteristics","PRT","rear-end CWS","artificial neural network","ANN","rear-end collision warning algorithm","MCWA","time to collision","TTC","stopping distance algorithm","SDA","rear-end collision risks","car-following"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225657/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"A study on the rear-end collision warning system by considering different perception-reaction time using multi-layer perceptron neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225657/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15402631","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on the rear-end collision warning system by considering different perception-reaction time using multi-layer perceptron neural network","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082545S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7225670,"authors":[{"name":"Niclas Evestedt","affiliation":["Division of Automatic Control, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Niclas","lastName":"Evestedt","id":"37085627988"},{"name":"Daniel Axehill","affiliation":["Division of Automatic Control, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Axehill","id":"37299668300"},{"name":"Marco Trincavelli","affiliation":["Research and Development, Scania CV AB, S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje, Sweden"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Trincavelli","id":"37402044200"},{"name":"Fredrik Gustafsson","affiliation":["Division of Automatic Control, Link\u00f6ping University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Gustafsson","id":"37283417600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7266-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"7225670","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"abstract":"In this paper an extension to the sampling based motion planning framework CL-RRT is presented. The framework uses a system model and a stabilizing controller to sample the perceived environment and build a tree of possible trajectories that are evaluated for execution. Complex system models and constraints are easily handled by a forward simulation making the framework widely applicable. To increase operational safety we propose a sampling recovery scheme that performs a deterministic brake profile regeneration using collision information from the forward simulation. This greatly increases the number of safe trajectories and also reduces the number of samples that produce infeasible results. We apply the framework to a Scania G480 mining truck and evaluate the algorithm in a simple yet challenging obstacle course and show that our approach greatly increases the number of feasible paths available for execution.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Vehicles","Planning","Vehicle dynamics","Mathematical model","Safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brakes","closed loop systems","collision avoidance","large-scale systems","road accidents","road safety","road traffic control","road vehicles","stability","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling recovery","closed loop rapidly expanding random tree","sampling based motion planning framework","CL-RRT","stabilizing controller","complex system models","operational safety","deterministic brake profile regeneration","collision information","forward simulation","safe trajectories","Scania G480 mining truck"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225670","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225670.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling recovery for closed loop rapidly expanding random tree using brake profile regeneration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling recovery for closed loop rapidly expanding random tree using brake profile regeneration","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225670/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225670/","accessionNumber":"15402652","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling recovery for closed loop rapidly expanding random tree using brake profile regeneration","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045668S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7225671,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China","Institute of Computing Technologies, China Academy of Railway Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Liu","id":"37279479500"},{"name":"Tianyun Shi","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technologies, China Academy of Railway Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tianyun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085568583"},{"name":"Ping Li","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technologies, China Academy of Railway Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Li","id":"37085648037"},{"name":"Xuemei Ren","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xuemei","lastName":"Ren","id":"37085700347"},{"name":"Hongbin Ma","affiliation":["School of Automation, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongbin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085700709"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7266-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"7225671","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225671","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Turning","Planning","Genetic algorithms","Linear programming","Simulation","Evolutionary computation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","mobile robots","particle swarm optimisation","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory planning","unmanned aerial vehicle","UAV","particle swarm optimization","PSO algorithm","objective function","cooperative trajectory altitude"]}],"abstract":"By the cooperative and competitive PSO algorithm, the goal of this study is to provide the cooperative trajectories of multiple UAVs in the three dimensional space.

To install pedestrian detection in a regular vehicle, however, there is a need to reduce its cost and ensure high accuracy. Although many approaches have been developed, vision-based methods of pedestrian detection are best suited to these requirements. In this paper, we propose the methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that achieves high accuracy in various fields. To achieve such generalization, our CNN-based method introduces Random Dropout and Ensemble Inference Network (EIN) to the training and classification processes, respectively. Random Dropout selects units that have a flexible rate, instead of the fixed rate in conventional Dropout. EIN constructs multiple networks that have different structures in fully connected layers. The proposed methods achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, even though the structure of the proposed methods are considerably simpler.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225690.pdf","startPage":"223","endPage":"228","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pedestrian detection based on deep convolutional neural network with ensemble inference network","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225690","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225690/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian detection based on deep convolutional neural network with ensemble inference network","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402530","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225690/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian detection based on deep convolutional neural network with ensemble inference network","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0201.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067293S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225690","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7225700,"authors":[{"name":"Shengbo Eben Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Automotive Eng., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shengbo Eben","lastName":"Li","id":"38184217700"},{"name":"Yang Zheng","affiliation":["Dept. of Automotive Eng., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085510524"},{"name":"Keqiang Li","affiliation":["Dept. of Automotive Eng., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Keqiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37277621900"},{"name":"Jianqiang Wang","affiliation":["Dept. of Automotive Eng., Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jianqiang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406468700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7266-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"7225700","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":91,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1983},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability analysis","Vehicles","Topology","Asymptotic stability","Vehicle dynamics","Coherence","Numerical stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed control","mobile robots","networked control systems","road safety","road traffic control","road vehicles","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicular platoon control","four-component framework","autonomous ground vehicle","road traffic","highway safety enhancement","traffic utility improvement","fuel consumption reduction","networked control","node dynamics","ND","information flow topology","IFT","distributed controller","DC","geometry formation","GF","string stability","stability margin","coherence behavior"]}],"abstract":"The platooning of autonomous ground vehicles has potential to largely benefit the road traffic, including enhancing highway safety, improving traffic utility and reducing fuel consumption.

However, research on this simple stereo estimation technique has been very scarce since the advent of energy-based methods which promise a higher quality and a larger potential for further improvement. In the domain of intelligent vehicles, especially semi-global-matching (SGM) is widely spread due to its good performance and simple implementation. Unfortunately, the big downside of SGM is its large memory footprint because it is working on the full disparity space image. In contrast to this, local block-matching stereo is much more lean. In this paper, we will introduce a novel multi-block-matching scheme which tremendously improves the result of standard block-matching stereo while preserving the low memory-footprint and the low computational complexity. We tested our new multi-block-matching scheme on the KITTI stereo benchmark as well as on the new Middlebury stereo benchmark. For the KITTI benchmark we achieve results that even surpass the results of the best SGM implementations. For the new Middlebury benchmark we get results that are only slightly worse than state-of-the-art SGM implementations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium

To achieve the mentioned goals, a sophisticated fusion approach for robust environment perception is essential. Apart from the necessary motion planning algorithms, this paper thus focuses on the sensor-independent fusion scheme. It allows for an efficient sensor replacement and realizes redundancy by using probabilistic and generic interfaces. Redundancy is ensured by utilizing multiple sensors of different types in crucial modules like grid mapping, localization and tracking. Furthermore, the combination of the module outputs to a consistent environment model is achieved by employing their probabilistic representation. The performance of the vehicle is discussed using the experience from numerous autonomous driving tests on public roads.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous driving at Ulm University: A modular, robust, and sensor-independent fusion approach","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225761","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225761.pdf","startPage":"666","endPage":"673","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous driving at Ulm University: A modular, robust, and sensor-independent fusion approach","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225761/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402629","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous driving at Ulm University: A modular, robust, and sensor-independent fusion approach","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.201155S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-03"},{"_id":7225786,"authors":[{"name":"Lachlan Horne","affiliation":["NICTA and Australian National University"],"firstName":"Lachlan","lastName":"Horne","id":"38512934000"},{"name":"Jose M.

However, this requires high-quality unary potentials to be computed, which is currently time-consuming. While some recent work attempts to address this issue by only computing a subset of unary potentials, a need remains for a simple, fast way to decide which unary potentials should be computed, without sacrificing accuracy. In particular, for embedded applications, a method which avoids time or memory-intensive operations is desired. In this paper, we introduce an approach to selecting good locations to compute unary potentials. We implement an efficient morphological approach to select a small proportion of pixel locations where unary potentials will be calculated. The speed of our labelling method allows us to directly search a large parameter space to optimize our method for a given task. We show that our method can achieve comparable accuracy to what can be achieved when all unary potentials are calculated, with significant time saving. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to tune our method to yield improved accuracy for certain classes of interest. We demonstrate this over multiple datasets representing challenging applications for our approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225786/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225786/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402638","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient scene parsing by sampling unary potentials in a fully-connected CRF","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient scene parsing by sampling unary potentials in a fully-connected CRF","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0266.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082055S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225786","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7225815,"authors":[{"name":"Jinsoo Kim","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Convergence Engineering, Graduate school of Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jinsoo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085714463"},{"name":"Jinhan Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Convergence Engineering, Graduate school of Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jinhan","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37085681414"},{"name":"Kyung-young Jhang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hanyang, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyung-young","lastName":"Jhang","id":"37371944500"},{"name":"Jahng-hyon Park","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hanyang, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jahng-hyon","lastName":"Park","id":"37616529200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7266-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"7225815","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225815","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Stability analysis","Oscillators","Microscopy","Delays","Propagation","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","nonlinear control systems","road safety","road traffic","road vehicles","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["disturbance propagation","disturbance amplification","vehicle platoon system","traffic shockwave propagation","car-following control strategy","time delay","nonlinearity terms","vehicle platoon control","VPC","traffic flow stability","optimal velocity model","OVM"]}],"abstract":"Disturbance propagation and string stability of a large vehicle platoon that consists of a part of the traffic flow is closely related to traffic shockwaves and oscillation. In this respect, the concepts of the estimation and prediction of shockwave propagation speeds and congestion should be considered in order to establish a control strategy for safe conditions without collisions even when the congestion is amplified in an unstable string of the large platoon. This means that an advanced approach for a car-following control strategy, which includes a time delay and non-linearity terms, is necessary for the enhancement of Vehicle Platoon Control (VPC) and the system robustness. In this research, we have demonstrated the effect of the disturbance propagation phenomenon on traffic flow stability. The traffic flow shockwave and oscillation are interpreted in terms of both macroscopic and microscopic approaches. We also discuss how the phenomenon affects VPC systems based on the optimal velocity model (OVM), which is an advanced car-following model. In addition, we improve the OVM, which is called the advanced OVM, by including a term for the delay time and by setting up a boundary condition of acceleration in order to enhance the VPC system and to ensure its robustness.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225815","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225815.pdf","startPage":"999","endPage":"1005","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demonstration of disturbance propagation and amplification in car-following situation for enhancement of vehicle platoon system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Demonstration of disturbance propagation and amplification in car-following situation for enhancement of vehicle platoon system","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225815/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402500","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225815/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demonstration of disturbance propagation and amplification in car-following situation for enhancement of vehicle platoon system","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085667S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225815","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7225827,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Nuss","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement Control, and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Germany"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Nuss","id":"38252214000"},{"name":"Ting Yuan","affiliation":["Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085674436"},{"name":"Gunther Krehl","affiliation":["Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Gunther","lastName":"Krehl","id":"37085672098"},{"name":"Manuel Stuebler","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement Control, and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Germany"],"firstName":"Manuel","lastName":"Stuebler","id":"37085678071"},{"name":"Stephan Reuter","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement Control, and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Reuter","id":"37864064600"},{"name":"Klaus Dietmayer","affiliation":["Institute of Measurement Control, and Microtechnology, Ulm University, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Dietmayer","id":"37283417900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7266-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"7225827","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":1360},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicle dynamics","Estimation","Probability density function","Vehicles","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Doppler radar","filtering theory","Monte Carlo methods","object tracking","optical radar","radar signal processing","sensor fusion","signal representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar sensor data fusion","laser fusion","sequential Monte Carlo Bayesian occupancy filter","occupancy grid mapping","environment perception approach","sensor measurement","SMC-BOF","object tracking approach","object-free representation","radar measurements doppler information","grid map dynamic estimation","ghost movement reduction"]}],"abstract":"Occupancy grid mapping is a well-known environment perception approach. A grid map divides the environment into cells and estimates the occupancy probability of each cell based on sensor measurements. An important extension is the Bayesian occupancy filter (BOF), which additionally estimates the dynamic state of grid cells and allows modeling changing environments. In recent years, the BOF attracted more and more attention, especially sequential Monte Carlo implementations (SMC-BOF), requiring less computational costs. An advantage compared to classical object tracking approaches is the object-free representation of arbitrarily shaped obstacles and free-space areas. Unfortunately, publications about BOF based on laser measurements report that grid cells representing big, contiguous, stationary obstacles are often mistaken as moving with the velocity of the ego vehicle (ghost movements). This paper presents a method to fuse laser and radar measurement data with the SMC-BOF. It shows that the doppler information of radar measurements significantly improves the dynamic estimation of the grid map, reduces ghost movements, and in general leads to a faster convergence of the dynamic estimation.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225827","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225827.pdf","startPage":"1074","endPage":"1081","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of laser and radar sensor data with a sequential Monte Carlo Bayesian occupancy filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of laser and radar sensor data with a sequential Monte Carlo Bayesian occupancy filter","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225827/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402591","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225827/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of laser and radar sensor data with a sequential Monte Carlo Bayesian occupancy filter","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056062S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7225828,"authors":[{"name":"Bingnan Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Bingnan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"38600812000"},{"name":"Yunsi Fei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yunsi","lastName":"Fei","id":"37404688200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7266-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"7225828","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1093},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Hidden Markov models","Roads","Artificial neural networks","Predictive models","Data models","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","neural nets","road traffic","traffic engineering computing","vehicular ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","hidden Markov model","on-road vehicle speed prediction method","intelligent vehicular applications","intelligent transportation applications","vehicular network","real-time traffic information prediction","NN","Baum-Welch algorithm","statistical relationship","HMM","road segment","driving route","SUMO microscopic traffic simulator","Luxembourg highway network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225828","abstract":"Accurate on-road vehicle speed prediction is important for many intelligent vehicular and transportation applications.

This paper proposes a novel vehicle speed prediction method in the context of vehicular networks, where the real-time traffic information is accessible. Traffic speeds of following road segments are first predicted by Neural Networks (NNs) based on historical traffic data. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are trained by the Baum-Welch algorithm with historical traffic and vehicle data to present the statistical relationship between vehicle speed and traffic speed. The forward-backward algorithm is applied on HMMs to extract vehicle's speed on each road segment along the driving route. Simulation is set up on the SUMO microscopic traffic simulator with the application of a real Luxembourg highway network and traffic count data. The vehicle speed prediction result shows that our proposed method outperforms other ones in terms of prediction accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225828","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225828.pdf","startPage":"1082","endPage":"1087","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic and vehicle speed prediction with neural network and Hidden Markov model in vehicular networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Traffic and vehicle speed prediction with neural network and Hidden Markov model in vehicular networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15402575","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225828/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic and vehicle speed prediction with neural network and Hidden Markov model in vehicular networks","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0274.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061932S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7225830,"authors":[{"name":"Jason Kong","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Jason","lastName":"Kong","id":"37085659658"},{"name":"Mark Pfeiffer","affiliation":["Institute for Dynamic Systems and Control, ETH Zurich"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Pfeiffer","id":"37085660218"},{"name":"Georg Schildbach","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Schildbach","id":"38232682600"},{"name":"Francesco Borrelli","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berkeley"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Borrelli","id":"37085672322"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7266-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"7225830","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":171,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6782},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinematics","Vehicle dynamics","Predictive models","Bicycles","Tires","Trajectory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","kinematics","predictive control","road traffic control","road vehicles","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kinematic vehicle models","dynamic vehicle models","autonomous driving control design","model-based control design","forecast error statistics","discretization effect","model predictive control","MPC","simple kinematic bicycle model","windy road"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225830","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225830.pdf","startPage":"1094","endPage":"1099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225830","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kinematic and dynamic vehicle models for autonomous driving control design","abstract":"We study the use of kinematic and dynamic vehicle models for model-based control design used in autonomous driving.

In this study, we propose Sampling-based Collision Warning System (SCWS) that overcomes the limitations of existing collision warning systems such as high installation cost, requirement of high market penetration rate, and the lack of consideration of traffic dynamics. SCWS gathers vehicle operation data though smartphones of drivers on the road and shares the information of surrounding vehicles' movement through a cloud server. From the pool of information on the cloud, SCWS uses sampled data, which indirectly represents the traffic state and traffic changes in the perspective of the leader vehicle. Therefore, SCWS can effectively replace the leader vehicle's information with the average behavior of sampled surrounding vehicles. The performance of SCWS is evaluated with comparison to Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication based Collision Warning System (VCWS) and Infrastructure based Collision Warning System (ICWS), where VCWS is considered the most similar measure to the actual collision risk in theory, but in practice very difficult to achieve due many limitations, such as high installation cost and market penetration. The result shows that in both aggregation and disaggregation level analysis the proposed SCWS exhibits a similar collision risk trend to the VCWS. Furthermore, the SCWS shows a high potential for practical application because it has the acceptable performance even with a low sampling ratio (40%), requiring a low market penetration rate and low installation cost by using the wide spread smartphone.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling-based collision warning system with smartphone in cloud computing environment","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225843","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225843.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225843","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Sampling-based collision warning system with smartphone in cloud computing environment","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225843/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402531","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling-based collision warning system with smartphone in cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0018.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069496S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7225852,"authors":[{"name":"Theodosis Georgiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Personal Robotics Laboratory, London, UK"],"firstName":"Theodosis","lastName":"Georgiou","id":"37085658815"},{"name":"Yiannis Demiris","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Personal Robotics Laboratory, London, UK"],"firstName":"Yiannis","lastName":"Demiris","id":"37296338900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7266-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"7225852","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":229},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Vehicles","Gaussian processes","Training","Data models","Computational modeling","Vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","driver information systems","Gaussian processes","mean square error methods","vehicle dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["car states prediction","learned models","vehicle dynamics","user behaviours","smart assistance systems","prediction methodology","vehicle information","user information","Gaussian processes","high speed car racing","car position","car speed","root mean square error"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225852","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225852.pdf","startPage":"1240","endPage":"1245","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predicting car states through learned models of vehicle dynamics and user behaviours","abstract":"The ability to predict forthcoming car states is crucial for the development of smart assistance systems.

Results show that the forthcoming position and speed of the car can be predicted with low Root Mean Square Error through the trained model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225852/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7225852/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15402541","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Predicting car states through learned models of vehicle dynamics and user behaviours","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predicting car states through learned models of vehicle dynamics and user behaviours","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"0238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076444S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7180136","isNumber":"7225648","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7180136","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7225648","articleId":"7225852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7225907,"authors":[{"name":"Julian Schlechtriemen","affiliation":["Daimler AG, Boblingen, Germany"],"firstName":"Julian","lastName":"Schlechtriemen","id":"37085484362"},{"name":"Florian Wirthmueller","affiliation":["Illmenau University of Technology"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Wirthmueller","id":"37085694272"},{"name":"Andreas Wedel","affiliation":["Institute for Real-Time Learning Systems, University of Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Wedel","id":"37391011500"},{"name":"Gabi Breuel","affiliation":["Daimler AG, Stuttgart, Baden-W\u00c3\u00bcrttemberg, DE"],"firstName":"Gabi","lastName":"Breuel"},{"name":"Klaus-Dieter Kuhnert","affiliation":["Institute for Real-Time Learning Systems, University of Siegen, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus-Dieter","lastName":"Kuhnert","id":"37284708900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7266-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7265-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1931-0587"}],"articleNumber":"7225907","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1037},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Trajectory","Probabilistic logic","Prediction algorithms","Training","Context","Vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","mixture models","pattern classification","probability","regression analysis","road traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic regression approach","traffic situations","dynamic traffic environments","autonomous driving","traffic scene prediction","highway scenarios","maneuver prediction","classification problem","lane-change behavior","random decision forest","maneuvers lane following","Gaussian mixture regression method","probability density functions","maneuver probabilities","mixture of experts approach"]}],"abstract":"Understanding traffic situations in dynamic traffic environments is an essential requirement for autonomous driving. The prediction of the current traffic scene into the future is one of the main problems in this context. In this publication we focus on highway scenarios, where the maneuver space for traffic participants is limited to a small number of possible behavior classes. Even though there are many publications in the field of maneuver prediction, most of them set the focus on the classification problem, whether a certain maneuver is executed or not. We extend approaches which solve the classification problem of lane-change behavior by introducing the novel aspect of estimating a continuous distribution of possible trajectories. Our novel approach uses the probabilities which are assigned by a Random Decision Forest to each of the maneuvers lane following, lane change left and lane change right. Using measured data of a vehicle and the knowledge of the typical lateral movement of vehicles over time taken from realworlddata, we derive a Gaussian Mixture Regression method. For the final result we combine the predicted probability density functions of the regression method and the computed maneuver probabilities using a Mixture of Experts approach. In a large scale experiment on real world data collected on multiple test drives we trained and validated our prediction model and show the gained high prediction accuracy of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/IVS.2015.7225907","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7180136/7225648/07225907.pdf","startPage":"1373","endPage":"1379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IVS.2015.7225907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"When will it change the lane?

Any variation in the supply voltage, would adversely affect its normal operation. Hence it is important to detect any power quality disturbance and identify the nature of the disturbance. A major issue is to find the motor parameter which can satisfactorily identify and classify the disturbance. This paper proposes a novel method for the detection and classification of PQ disturbances in the supply to induction motor using the signature of the stator current. The tools used for the analysis are wavelet transforms and neural network. In the first stage the stator current is sampled and DWT is applied to it to capture the feature of the disturbance. The DWT co-efficients so obtained are used as input to a feed forward neural network, in the second stage, to classify the disturbance. This method has been tested for different PQ disturbances such as balanced voltage sag, balanced voltage swell, unbalanced voltage sag and unbalanced voltage swell (or simply called as unbalance in the magnitude of the supply). The method has been found to be effective for varying degrees of disturbance. It is observed that the proposed network has performance efficiency greater than 97%.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and classification of PQ disturbances in the supply to induction motor using wavelet transform and feedforward neural network","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7225930","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07225930.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7225930","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225930/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Detection and classification of PQ disturbances in the supply to induction motor using wavelet transform and feedforward neural network","conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225930/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15402905","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and classification of PQ disturbances in the supply to induction motor using wavelet transform and feedforward neural network","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT006.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04993S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7225930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7225936,"authors":[{"name":"Gopalasetti Dinesh","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Gayathri Vidya Parishad College of Engineering(A), Visakhapatnam, India"],"firstName":"Gopalasetti","lastName":"Dinesh","id":"37085682295"},{"name":"B.

Based on the overall system ratings of 40 KVA, 115VAC and 400Hz, appropriate design parameters have been estimated for each of the basic components of the three-stage brushless excitation system, namely the pilot exciter, main exciter, and main generator. In addition to conventional PI voltage and current regulators to maintain the rated output behavior under load variations, anew type of current limiter is proposed as a protection mechanism for practical operation under a symmetrical fault. Through simulation studies, it is shown that, while a traditional PI current controller is effective in limiting the steady-state short circuit current to its rated value (350A),introducing a special type of thermistor (NTC) in series with the fault-creating resistors is much more efficient in limiting the transient inrush current induced just at the time of fault. This modeling methodology can be used for transient and steady-state performance analysis under nominal and symmetrical fault conditions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of a traditional aircraft generator and its sub-systems","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7225936","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7225936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07225936.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7225936","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7225936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of a traditional aircraft generator and its sub-systems","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7225936/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15402856","conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of a traditional aircraft generator and its sub-systems","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059745S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7225936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7225940,"authors":[{"name":"Jagdish Madhukar Ghogare","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering Sinhgad Institute of Technology Lonavala, India"],"firstName":"Jagdish Madhukar","lastName":"Ghogare","id":"37085693094"},{"name":"V.

Thoroughness of randomized unit testing is according to the settings of optimal parameters. Randomized testing uses randomization for some aspects of test input data. Designing Genetic algorithm (GA) is somewhat of a black art. The feature subset selection (FSS) tool is used with GA to assess and to reduce the size and the content of the test case. FSS can be used to find and remove unnecessary parts of the search control automatically. The existing system does not cover all test data in test cases for the reason that it can quickly generate many test cases and does not consider the target method. Thus GA for Randomized unit testing has not achieves high coverage and does not produce better optimal test data. In the proposed method, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used for randomized unit testing. PSO algorithm is used to evaluate the target method solutions for test coverage in test data. The main goal is to generate the optimal test parameter, to reduce the size of test case generation and to achieve high coverage of the units under test. PSO achieves high coverage and produce optimal value. PSO algorithm is enhanced weighted value. Weighted Particle Swarm Optimization (WPSO) algorithm uses weight value in calculating the mean best position for each particle.

The main features to be considered while selecting a load balancing algorithm for cloud is the ability of the algorithm to address distributed network, dynamic environment and self-regulation. Biased random sampling is one such algorithm; it allocates jobs by performing a random walk in the network. The selection of neighbour is uniformly distributed among the neighbour nodes in case of biased random sampling algorithm. Improved version of random sampling algorithm uses cost based load computation to select node for random walk [1]. This paper introduces neighbour awareness and prediction mechanisms to further improve the selection process of nodes for random walk. The proposed algorithm selects the least loaded node from the neighbour list for the random walk. This can be achieved by computing probability of each neighbour based on perceived load of the respective neighbour. Thus the probability of choosing lightly loaded node can be increased and hence the job waiting time can be decreased further.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226080","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226080.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226080","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neighbour Aware Random Sampling (NARS) algorithm for load balancing in Cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Neighbour Aware Random Sampling (NARS) algorithm for load balancing in Cloud computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226080/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412114","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226080/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neighbour Aware Random Sampling (NARS) algorithm for load balancing in Cloud computing","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05934S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226080","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226084,"authors":[{"name":"Ananya SenGupta","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of Technology Silchar, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Ananya","lastName":"SenGupta","id":"37085755424"},{"name":"Dalton Meitei Thounaojam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, National Institute of Technology Silchar, Assam, India"],"firstName":"Dalton Meitei","lastName":"Thounaojam","id":"37085757068"},{"name":"Kh.

The convergence plots have shown the impact of the SLL constraint on the convergence.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226120","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226120.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude-only null positioning in circular arrays using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226120/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Amplitude-only null positioning in circular arrays using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226120/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15412187","publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude-only null positioning in circular arrays using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043721S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7226125,"authors":[{"name":"Nasreen Sultana","affiliation":["Dept of EIE"],"firstName":"Nasreen","lastName":"Sultana","id":"37085630850"},{"name":"Yedukondalu Kamatham","affiliation":["Dept of ECE, Bhoj Reddy Engineering College, Hyderabad, India"],"firstName":"Yedukondalu","lastName":"Kamatham","id":"37085405515"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6085-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6084-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6083-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7226125","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Electrocardiography","MATLAB","Signal to noise ratio","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Smoothing methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","electrocardiography","least mean squares methods","medical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG signals","Savitzky-Golay least squares polynomials","discrete wavelet transform","electrode noise","electronic noise","motion artifacts","random noises","biomedical signal acquisition","adaptive filters","Savitzky-Golay filter","noisy ECG stimulus","mean square error","Savitzky-Golay smoothing filter","medical diagnosis applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ECG","DWT","Savitzky-Golay filter","Least Squares","Noise","De-noising","Interference"]}],"abstract":"ECG signal is mostly used in biomedical research and for clinical diagnosis. Recorded ECG signal often contains a noise and interference with non-stationery properties. Electrode noise, electronic noise and motion artifacts are most common type of random noises which are recorded in the ECG signal. One of the major problem in biomedical signal acquisition is to separate small input signal from noise and disturbance caused by 50 Hz power supply. The main objective of this paper is the performance analysis of two adaptive filters namely Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter with and without smoothening and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for noisy ECG stimulus. Results are encouraging. The Mean Square Error (MSE) reduced to 5.07, 3.72, and 1.101 with Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Savitzky-Golay (SG) Filter and Savitzky-Golay (SG) Smoothing Filter respectively. Hence SG Filter with smoothing is very useful for denoising ECG signals in medical diagnosis applications.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226125","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226125.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mitigation of noise and interference in ECG signals with Savitzky-Golay least squares polynomials and Discrete Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226125","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mitigation of noise and interference in ECG signals with Savitzky-Golay least squares polynomials and Discrete Wavelet Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226125/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412129","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226125/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mitigation of noise and interference in ECG signals with Savitzky-Golay least squares polynomials and Discrete Wavelet Transform","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT204.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076929S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226134,"authors":[{"name":"Deepansh Dubey","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Deepansh","lastName":"Dubey","id":"37085707672"},{"name":"Anu Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, Rajasthan, India"],"firstName":"Anu","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37403697400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6085-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6084-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6083-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7226134","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":760},"abstract":"In this paper, a new low power, low noise operational amplifier dedicated to implantable biomedical applications is introduced. The amplifier is designed to minimize input referred noise and power consumption. To reduce input thermal noise, we use the EKV Model to set the bias currents of the transistors. To reduce the flicker noise, PMOS input transistors with large gate areas and operating in weak inversion are used. The noise reduction technique of switched biasing is then applied, which involves switching the transistor periodically between accumulation (cutoff) and inversion region. This helps to further reduce the flicker noise of the transistors. The use of switched biasing allows us to reduce the input noise, without having to increase the current and thus allows us to avoid the problem of trading power with noise. Using this technique, we are able to achieve an extremely low input noise of 2.89\u03bcV\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">rms</sub>\n in the desired bandwidth, at a small supply current of 4.8\u03bcA. The additional circuitry required for switched biasing consumes minimal power, and the average power consumption of the amplifier is 15.174\u03bcW, which makes it ideal for implantable applications. The gain of the amplifier is 76.2dB in the required frequency range, with a phase margin of 74\u00b0 and a CMRR greater than 120dB at all frequencies. The circuit is designed using the TSMC 0.18\u03bcm process, in the Analog Design Environment of Cadence Virtuoso. The performance of the circuit is studied at all process corners, namely TT, FF, SS, SF and FS. The simulations are carried out at 36.9\u00b0C, the normal human body temperature.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Choppers (circuits)","Transistors","MOS devices","Semiconductor device modeling","Thermal noise","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical electronics","flicker noise","integrated circuit design","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","MOSFET","operational amplifiers","thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power low noise amplifier","operational amplifier","implantable biomedical applications","input referred noise","power consumption","input thermal noise","flicker noise","PMOS input transistors","noise reduction technique","switched biasing","current 4.8 muA","power 15.174 muW","gain 76.2 dB","size 0.18 mum","temperature 36.9 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bio-potential amplifier","EKV Model","Switched biasing","input referred noise","noise efficiency factor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226134","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226134.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low power low noise amplifier for biomedical applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low power low noise amplifier for biomedical applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226134/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226134/","accessionNumber":"15412229","conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low power low noise amplifier for biomedical applications","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT213.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063624S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7226137,"authors":[{"name":"Mehraj Din Mir","affiliation":["Deptt. of ECE.

However, it suffers from high peak to average power ratio that arises when the subcarrier signal phases are same. The literature survey shows that partial transmit sequence (PTS) is best among the multiple signaling and probabilistic techniques for PAPR reduction. However, the circuit complexity increases with the increase in the number of sub-blocks. Under signal distortion methods of PAPR reduction, mu-Law companding offers better performance. In this paper, a scheme that performs mu-LAW companding operation on partial transmit sequence (PTS) signal is proposed to achieve low circuit complexity while offering better PAPR reduction. The proposed scheme provides better PAPR reduction compared to PTS with four blocks, nearly the same BER performance as PTS with two blocks, least circuit complexity when compared to PTS with four blocks. The performance of the proposed scheme is better than mu-law companding, conventional PTS, SLM and combined versions of SLM, PTS.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226139.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mu-Law companded PTS for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","OFDM modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Mu-Law companded PTS","PAPR reduction","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multicarrier modulation technique","multipath propagation effects","partial transmit sequence","circuit complexity","signal distortion methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PAPR reduction schemes","partial Transmit Sequence","Companding methods","combined methods","Mu-law companding","selective mapping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Mu-Law companded PTS for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226139/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412175","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mu-Law companded PTS for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086496S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226140,"authors":[{"name":"Maninder Singh","affiliation":["Indo Global College of Engineering, Mohali, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Maninder","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085399180"},{"name":"Hardeep Singh Saini","affiliation":["Indo Global College of Engineering, Mohali, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Hardeep Singh","lastName":"Saini","id":"37085404151"},{"name":"Dinesh Arora","affiliation":["GVIET Ramnagar-Banur, Rajpura Patiala, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Dinesh","lastName":"Arora","id":"37085699170"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6085-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6084-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6083-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7226140","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":328},"abstract":"A proposition is described in this paper regarding the use of algebraic space-time code (ASTC) and minimum mean square error equalizer (MMSE) for the amelioration of the bit error rate (BER) in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems so as to deduce the desired outcomes.

The most important features proposed in the IEEE 802.11ac amendment include larger channel bandwidth of 160 MHz, a denser modulation scheme 256 quadrature amplitude modulation(QAM) and a MU-MIMO ( multiuser MIMO) supporting up to eight spatial streams. This paper proposes to detect the spatial streams in 802.11ac device using (2\u00d72), (4\u00d74), (8\u00d78) MU-MIMO systems using some of the MIMO detection algorithms. Hence, the main aim of this paper is to evaluate the effect of Detectors/Interference Canceller (IC) like Zero-forcing (ZF),Minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and the proposed ZF-Successive IC(SIC) with Optimal Peak Power Ordering (OPPO), ZF -SIC-OPPO for WLAN on the performance of 802.11ac standard in a Rayleigh fading channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226142/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226142/","accessionNumber":"15402815","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Peak Power Ordering (OPPO) in ZF-SIC for IEEE 802.11ac industrial standard","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Peak Power Ordering (OPPO) in ZF-SIC for IEEE 802.11ac industrial standard","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047399S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":7226143,"authors":[{"name":"Neelappa","affiliation":["Department of E &C, Govt.

As the technology is shrinking down, the power supply is also scaled down which decreases the noise margin of the SRAM cells. The reduced noise margin further makes more leakage power in the SRAM cells. The main objective of this project is to deal with the power dissipation which occurs normally in the conventional Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cells during the read and write operation. This problem can be solved by applying dual-threshold-voltage for 6T, 7T, 8T and 9T SRAM Cells. Their respective power dissipation and delay of these cells are calculated and compared. This is implemented in 90nm Generic Process Design Kit (GPDK) using Cadence Virtuoso Schematic Composer and the Spectre as the simulator.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226147.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226147","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226147","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparative analysis of 6T, 7T, 8T and 9T SRAM cells in 90nm technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparative analysis of 6T, 7T, 8T and 9T SRAM cells in 90nm technology","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226147/","conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226147/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15402832","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparative analysis of 6T, 7T, 8T and 9T SRAM cells in 90nm technology","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039857S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226147","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226151,"authors":[{"name":"Shobha Sharma","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, Kashmere Gate, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shobha","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37085676051"},{"name":"Reshma Sinha","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, Kashmere Gate, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Reshma","lastName":"Sinha","id":"37085460215"},{"name":"Shuchita Kaila","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, Kashmere Gate, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Shuchita","lastName":"Kaila","id":"37085470030"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6085-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6084-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6083-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7226151","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":148},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Power demand","Microarchitecture","SDRAM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer centres","DRAM chips","low-power electronics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power reduction strategies","data centric applications","processors","power consumption","memory module","low power design","DRAM interface","viz.

As a result memory module consumes a major fraction of total power consumption in a system. This has led to low power design. This paper will evaluates three new DRAM interface, viz. MemBlaze, MemCorrect and MemDrowsy, developed at Stanford University, USA. Paper intends to extract out know-hows, tradeoffs incurred, and energy saving mode, hardware overheads and application area of the interfaces. All the three architectures work on reducing wakeup latencies of a Power-Up mode in DRAM, thus allowing the DRAM to use their Power-Down modes rigorously. The technique is capable of reducing the background power consumption up to 50%. The interface finds its application in the field which demands heavy memory usage like that of data centric applications, server memories, handling Big Data and Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP).","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226151.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power reduction strategies for DRAM used in data centric applications","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226151","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226151","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Power reduction strategies for DRAM used in data centric applications","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412133","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226151/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power reduction strategies for DRAM used in data centric applications","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098227S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226156,"authors":[{"name":"Nidhi Chandoke","affiliation":["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi"],"firstName":"Nidhi","lastName":"Chandoke","id":"37085360231"},{"name":"Neha Chitkara","affiliation":["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi"],"firstName":"Neha","lastName":"Chitkara","id":"37085360841"},{"name":"Anuj Grover","affiliation":["Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi"],"firstName":"Anuj","lastName":"Grover","id":"37072617400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6085-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6084-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6083-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7226156","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative analysis of Sense Amplifiers for SRAM in 65nm CMOS technology","abstract":"A comparative analysis of four sense amplifiers for Static Random Access Memories (SRAMs) namely conventional current Sense Amplifier (CSA), Current Latched Sense Amplifier (SA), Clamped Bitline SA and Gated Diode SA is presented in 65 nm CMOS technology.

HT is studied and its various application areas are discussed in the paper. Two different architectures are proposed using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for the implementation. Implementation of HT using the proposed FFT based architectures are compared with the implementations using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Discrete Hartley Transform (DHT).

Its superior characteristics include unlicensed wide bandwidth, high security and dual-use nature. It can transmit 4Mb/s in short distance. However VLC using illumination source is naturally suited to broadcast applications, it can also be used for full duplex communication but it resulted in instability of the system as it cannot operate without optical wireless localization technology, hence a hybrid network has been designed in which OFDMA is used for uplink transmission and VLC is used for downlink transmission. In order to demonstrate this a protocol has been proposed by combining the horizontal and vertical handover mechanisms for mobile terminal to resolve user mobility among different VLC hotspots and orthogonal frequency division multiple access(OFDMA).","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226162.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226162","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel protocol design in hybrid networks of Visible Light Communication and OFDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Mobile computing","Mobile communication","Light emitting diodes","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobility management (mobile radio)","OFDM modulation","optical communication","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocol design","hybrid networks","visible light communication","OFDMA system","uplink transmission","downlink transmission","horizontal handover mechanisms","vertical handover mechanisms","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","user mobility","mobile terminal"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["heterogeneous network","horizontal handover","vertical handover","hybrid visible light communication(VLC) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system","visible light communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226162/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"A novel protocol design in hybrid networks of Visible Light Communication and OFDMA system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226162/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412138","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel protocol design in hybrid networks of Visible Light Communication and OFDMA system","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061116S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226162","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226164,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In the third generation Partnership project -Long Term Evolution (3GPP LTE) of Fourth Generation (4G) provides greater speed compare with it is predecessor 3G and 2G. The higher data rate is achieved in the wireless environment by deployed OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple) and MIMO (Multiple Inputs and Multiple Outputs) technique. It employs smart selection and combining techniques in the receiver end to improve the signal quality. The sub-carrier fluctuates in different time slots with in an OFDM symbol as a cause of multipath fading (color noise environment). Here the priority is given to minimize the interference occurred among the symbols in the channels and compress the data stream for high speed digital data transmission. Estimating the channel as accurately as possible is essential. This paper constitutes for different channel estimation technique is implemented with OFDM and MIMO for high mobility. In this work an iterative channel estimation scheme is introduced that makes use of pilot symbols, Doppler spread information and previously estimated data symbols are utilized to estimate the channel accurately. The channel estimation techniques as Maximum Likelihood (ML), Minimum Mean Square (MMSE) and Zero Forcing (ZF) are utilized. ML estimation is used to estimate even the channel is in worst condition. If any symbol occurs with error then, the PIC-DSC (Parallel Interference Cancellation - Decision Statically combining) is involved in removing the unnecessary interference produced in the channel. The Performance and result analysis is done using MATLAB simulation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226164","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226164.pdf","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of robust channel estimation for high mobility systems","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226164","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Impact of robust channel estimation for high mobility systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226164/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15402901","publicationDate":"March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226164/","conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of robust channel estimation for high mobility systems","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057409S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7226181,"authors":[{"name":"Meenakshi Sansoy","affiliation":["ECE Department, Punjab Institute of Technology Kapurthala, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Meenakshi","lastName":"Sansoy","id":"37085637598"},{"name":"Avtar S.

Sensing in multipath fading channels using Cosine Modulated Filter Bank for Cognitive Radio applications","abstract":"In this paper, an elegant scheme for Spectrum Sensing (SS) in fading channels with Cosine Modulated Filter Banks (CMFBs) and energy detection method is proposed. Filter Bank Spectral estimators (FBSEs) are used as it allows sensing multiple subbands simultaneously. In fading channel conditions, the received signal also impaired with AWGN noise is equalized at the receiver and then sensed through Cosine modulated Spectral estimators. The energy detection is performed at the subband outputs of the CMFB. Spectral holes can be detected with high confidence due to spectral containment of cosine modulation in subband sensing. This method provides the flexibility to detect active signals in a fading environment. Simulations are done with Zero Forcing Equalizer (ZFE) and Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalizers and the results are compared.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226185/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15412186","publicationDate":"March 2015","conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226185/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sensing in multipath fading channels using Cosine Modulated Filter Bank for Cognitive Radio applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sensing in multipath fading channels using Cosine Modulated Filter Bank for Cognitive Radio applications","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT264.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065201S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226189,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The challenge in system design is the multipath fading which results in weak signal strength at the receiver, this increases the Bit Error Rate (BER) of Communication Systems. Employing multiple antennas is used to get reliable performance through diversity and achievable higher data rate through spatial multiplexing. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems are wireless Technology with multiple antenna elements at both ends of the link to transfer more data at the same time since fading for each link is considered to be independent and have the ability to deal with multipath propagation. This paper deals with BER analysis of MIMO Systems under different communication channels Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Fading channel (Rayleigh and Rician). MIMO system uses Zero Forcing (ZF) decoder and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) at the receiver and encoded Alamouti STBC is used as transmit diversity. System performance in diverse modulation techniques such as BPSK, QAM and PAM is examined using MATLAB. The simulated result shows that comparing the three different channel conditions, Rician fading channel has better performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226189","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226189.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO system performance using various modulations under different channels with STBC, ZF and MRC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO system performance using various modulations under different channels with STBC, ZF and MRC","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 March 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226189/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 March 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15412252","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226189/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO system performance using various modulations under different channels with STBC, ZF and MRC","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"2015ICECCT268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064599S","chronDate":"5-7 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7190493","isNumber":"7225915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7190493","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7225915","articleId":"7226189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226198,"authors":[{"name":"Ningrinla Marchang","affiliation":["North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology, Nirjuli, A.P."],"firstName":"Ningrinla","lastName":"Marchang","id":"37831826000"},{"name":"Roshni Rajkumari","affiliation":["North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology, Nirjuli, A.P."],"firstName":"Roshni","lastName":"Rajkumari","id":"37085491581"},{"name":"Suchismita Bhattacharjee Brahmachary","affiliation":["North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology, Nirjuli, A.P."],"firstName":"Suchismita Bhattacharjee","lastName":"Brahmachary","id":"37085700789"},{"name":"Amar Taggu","affiliation":["North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology, Nirjuli, A.P."],"firstName":"Amar","lastName":"Taggu","id":"37855938900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6085-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6084-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-6083-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7226198","dbTime":"42 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Wireless communication","Licenses","Detectors","Simulation","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","radio networks","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","dynamic decision rule","cooperative spectrum sensing","fusion rules","OR rule","majority rule","general k-out-of-n decision rule","channel busy"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic decision rule for cooperative spectrum sensing in Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7225915","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Communication Technologies (ICECCT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7190493/7225915/07226198.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCT.2015.7226198","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226198","abstract":"A cognitive radio may cooperate with others in the spectrum sensing process for a more accurate sensing result.

Planar arrays are an attractive alternative. They do not require mechanical scanning, and images are formed digitally using beamforming techniques [1]. To achieve image quality comparable to mechanically scanned radars, fully populated arrays require inordinate numbers of elements. These are costly, a challenge to design, and difficult to produce. Thinned or sparse arrays are a potential solution to this problem. MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) techniques are an efficient method of thinning an array using spreading sequences to create an overlay of paired transmitter and receiver elements, without sacrificing image quality. The use of MIMO techniques to thin an array is a relatively recent development [2]. To be of practical use at millimeter-wave frequencies, MIMO techniques require the development of novel array geometries and architecture. This paper presents designs for the implementation of millimeter-wave planar arrays which have been thinned using MIMO techniques and considerers the limitations on the length of spreading sequences due to the increasingly pronounced effect of Doppler at higher frequencies. These considerations have led to the first instance of the use of the Moreno-Tirkel sequence Family B for high resolution imaging radar.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226217/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15413202","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226217/","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Millimeter wave array for UAV imaging MIMO radar","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter wave array for UAV imaging MIMO radar","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"PID3575473Rankin.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036652S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209173","isNumber":"7226207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209173","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7226207","articleId":"7226217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"German Institute of Navigation (DGON)","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":7226218,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Noroozi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, K.

Also, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the location estimates is obtained for both of them in this issue. For these two presented techniques, we see that the performance of the BR-based technique is quite better than the RD-based technique in the simulation results. For this reason, using the BR-based technique in multistatic passive radar is recommended. Furthermore, the BR-based method required one less receiver than the RD-based method for finding the target position uniquely. The simulation results also show that the placement is important to decrease the error of target position estimation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209173/7226207/07226218.pdf","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1063","publicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","doi":"10.1109/IRS.2015.7226218","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRS.2015.7226218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226207","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226218","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison between Range-Difference-based and Bistatic-Range-based localization in multistatic passive radar","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Transmitters","Passive radar","Mathematical model","Estimation","Simulation","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","estimation theory","passive radar","regression analysis","RSSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["range-difference-based localization","bistatic-range-based localization","multistatic passive radar","BR-based method","RD-based method","Cramer-Rao lower bound","CRLB","decrease target position estimation error","least square techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226218/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Comparison between Range-Difference-based and Bistatic-Range-based localization in multistatic passive radar","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226218/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15413187","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison between Range-Difference-based and Bistatic-Range-based localization in multistatic passive radar","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"PID3575847Noroozi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040788S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209173","isNumber":"7226207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209173","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7226207","articleId":"7226218","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"German Institute of Navigation (DGON)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226231,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Ksendzov","affiliation":["Ryazan state radio engineering university, Ryazan, RUSSIA"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Ksendzov","id":"37282386600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-9540-4853-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"7226231","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Azimuth","Estimation","Correlation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","fading channels","Fourier analysis","interpolation","inverse problems","omnidirectional antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multielement antenna","power azimuth spectrum estimation","PAS estimation","correlated fading channel","inverse problem solution","Fourier basis coefficients","complex correlation coefficients","uncoupled thin omnidirectional vibrators","spatial correlation function","SCF interpolation","MEA arrangement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226231","abstract":"A novel method for the power azimuth spectrum (PAS) estimation in correlated fading channel is proposed.

Many of these rely on radar sensors as a source of information about surrounding objects. Based on this information, for example, emergency braking maneuvers are initiated. This requires a very high reliability of the provided data. In the long term, these requirements will become even stricter as highly automated driving comes into play. In the near future, this will result in a high density of radar sensors operating simultaneously and in close proximity. This constellation generates mutual car-to-car interference if no precautions are taken. At present, efforts in measures to mitigate the interference concentrate on time-frequency signal processing. Spatial filtering using digital beamforming is another powerful method. This paper aims to cover the chain of interference, from the basic principles of waveform interaction in a radar sensor's receiver stage, up to mitigation techniques and consequences for signal processing in the presence of interference.","doi":"10.1109/IRS.2015.7226239","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209173/7226207/07226239.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRS.2015.7226239","publicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","startPage":"143","endPage":"148","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust detection and mitigation of mutual interference in automotive radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226239","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust detection and mitigation of mutual interference in automotive radar","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226239/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226239/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15413109","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust detection and mitigation of mutual interference in automotive radar","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"PID3623101Fischer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054184S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209173","isNumber":"7226207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209173","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7226207","articleId":"7226239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"German Institute of Navigation (DGON)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7226272,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A set of parameters to measure CS-based ISAR algorithm performance is provided in this paper and some examples are also shown by using real data.","doi":"10.1109/IRS.2015.7226312","publicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209173/7226207/07226312.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRS.2015.7226312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226207","startPage":"398","endPage":"403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing based ISAR: Performance evaluation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226312","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing based ISAR: Performance evaluation","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226312/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15413145","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226312/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing based ISAR: Performance evaluation","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"PID3644793Giusti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038073S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209173","isNumber":"7226207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209173","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7226207","articleId":"7226312","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"German Institute of Navigation (DGON)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226314,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The main task of such radars is to detect movements of targets such as an individual or a vehicle approaching a facility. The systems typically cover a range of several hundred meters up to several kilometers. In particular the capability of identifying remote-controlled Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), which pose a growing threat on critical infrastructure areas, is of great importance nowadays. The low cost, the easy handling, and a considerable payload make them an excellent tool for unwanted surveillance or attacks. Most platforms can be equipped with all kind of sensors or, in the worst case, with explosive devices. A typical MAV is able to take off and land vertically, to hover, and in many cases to fly forward with a high speed. Thus, it can reach all kinds of sites in short time while the concealed operator of the MAV is at a remote and riskless place.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209173/7226207/07226314.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"287","publicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","doi":"10.1109/IRS.2015.7226314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRS.2015.7226314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226207","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter wave radar for perimeter surveillance and detection of MAVs (Micro Aerial Vehicles)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar cross-sections","Sensors","Surveillance","Millimeter wave radar","Radar tracking","Radar detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["airborne radar","millimetre wave radar","object detection","search radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter wave radar","perimeter surveillance","perimeter detection","targets movement detection","remote-controlled microaerial vehicle","MAV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226314/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter wave radar for perimeter surveillance and detection of MAVs (Micro Aerial Vehicles)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226314/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15413025","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter wave radar for perimeter surveillance and detection of MAVs (Micro Aerial Vehicles)","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"PID3644813Caris.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103737S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209173","isNumber":"7226207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209173","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7226207","articleId":"7226314","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"German Institute of Navigation (DGON)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226326,"authors":[{"name":"Michele Ambrosanio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Michele","lastName":"Ambrosanio","id":"37085471969"},{"name":"Vito Pascazio","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Centro Direzionale di Napoli, Napoli, Italy"],"firstName":"Vito","lastName":"Pascazio","id":"37085458514"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-9540-4853-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"7226326","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Imaging","Scattering","Approximation methods","Geometry","Mathematical model","Compressed sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","buried object detection","compressed sensing","computational geometry","ground penetrating radar","image reconstruction","radar imaging","remote sensing by radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical analysis","compressive sensing approach","ground penetrating radar applications","small buried object detection","small buried object characterization","sparsity-driven approach","born approximation","reconstruction capability improvement","imaging algorithm","2D geometry"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a sparsity-driven approach for the detection and characterization of small buried objects has been proposed.

Based on the property of submodularity, a transmitter/receiver selection policy which minimizes the overall estimation covariance is proposed.

The DOD and DOA at each of the OFDM sub-carrier are estimated using a two-way multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, and a majority decision was applied to combine the estimations at all sub-carriers through formulation of angle histograms. Furthermore, the proposed scheme implemented an adaptive scheme that selects a number of sub-carriers to be used for the majority decision. The selection were based on singular values obtained from singular value decomposition operation at each sub-carrier. Numerical simulations along with experimental evaluation in a radio anechoic chamber showed improvement of estimation accuracy upon applying the adaptive sub-carrier selection scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint direction-of-departure and direction-of-arrival estimation in MIMO OFDM radars adopting adaptive sub-carrier selection scheme","publicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","doi":"10.1109/IRS.2015.7226352","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209173/7226207/07226352.pdf","startPage":"806","endPage":"811","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRS.2015.7226352","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226207","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226352","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226352/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint direction-of-departure and direction-of-arrival estimation in MIMO OFDM radars adopting adaptive sub-carrier selection scheme","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226352/","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15413181","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint direction-of-departure and direction-of-arrival estimation in MIMO OFDM radars adopting adaptive sub-carrier selection scheme","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"PID3647819IdninPasya.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034214S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209173","isNumber":"7226207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209173","xplore-issue":"7226207","articleId":"7226352","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"German Institute of Navigation (DGON)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226356,"authors":[{"name":"Jiahua Zhu","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Jiahua","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37073072100"},{"name":"Chongyi Fan","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Chongyi","lastName":"Fan","id":"37654718900"},{"name":"Pengzheng Lei","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Pengzheng","lastName":"Lei","id":"37085723931"},{"name":"Xiaotao Huang","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Xiaotao","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085723388"},{"name":"Guofu Zhu","affiliation":["National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Changsha, Hunan, P.R.China"],"firstName":"Guofu","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37986352900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-9540-4853-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"7226356","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Chirp","Object detection","Clutter","Modulation","Manganese","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency modulation","ground penetrating radar","OFDM modulation","radar clutter","radar detection","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","linear frequency modulation","OFDM chirp waveform generation model","orthogonal basic signal","energy detector","clutter environment","LFM waveform","GMTI","ground moving target indication"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) chirp waveform is a new kind of waveform scheme that combine the OFDM principle with the linear frequency modulation (LFM) waveform.

Commonly used aperture-domain mitigation methods such as coherence factor (CF), phase CF (PCF) and their modifications encounter some defects including insufficient data, suppression of weaker targets and heavy computing burden. In this paper, we propose extended CF (ECF) methods based on the sub-band subaperture (SBSA) image data to combat side/grating lobes and simultaneously overcome the above defects. With rational division of sub-bands and sub-apertures, on one hand, sufficient SBSA image data can be achieved in the UWB MIMO array, which guarantees the good side/grating lobe mitigation; on the other hand, SBSA image data have a certain ability of multiple targets discrimination in the range and azimuth directions and the side effects on weaker targets can be relieved. Besides, SBSA image data can be formed efficiently by the inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) assisted back projection. Simulations with an 8-element UWB MIMO array validate the proposed methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209173/7226207/07226373.pdf","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1075","publicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","doi":"10.1109/IRS.2015.7226373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRS.2015.7226373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226207","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grating/side lobes mitigation in sparse UWB MIMO array","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gratings","Arrays","Imaging","MIMO","Azimuth","Apertures","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","aperture antennas","fast Fourier transforms","inverse transforms","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar imaging","ultra wideband antennas","ultra wideband radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["azimuth grating lobe mitigation","azimuth side lobe mitigation","sparse ultra wideband UWB MIMO array","sparse UWB multiple input multiple output array","finite aperture size","limited antenna number","imaging radar","aperture-domain mitigation method","extended CF method","ECF method","extended coherence factor method","subband subaperture image","SBSA image","multiple targets discrimination","inverse fast Fourier transformation","IFFT assisted back projection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Grating/side lobes mitigation in sparse UWB MIMO array","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226373/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15413079","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grating/side lobes mitigation in sparse UWB MIMO array","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"PID3650859JunHu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04853S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209173","isNumber":"7226207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209173","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7226207","articleId":"7226373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"German Institute of Navigation (DGON)","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226376,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Radmard","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mojtaba","lastName":"Radmard","id":"37547157400"},{"name":"Mohammad Nazari Majd","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Nazari","lastName":"Majd","id":"38235435900"},{"name":"Mohammad Mahdi Chitgarha","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mahdi","lastName":"Chitgarha","id":"38247209300"},{"name":"Seyyed Mohammad Karbasi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyyed Mohammad","lastName":"Karbasi","id":"37889162100"},{"name":"Mohammad Mahdi Nayebi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mahdi","lastName":"Nayebi","id":"37273045900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-9540-4853-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"7226376","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Receivers","MIMO radar","Mathematical model","Optimization","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar system ambiguity function optimization","waveform design"]}],"abstract":"An important tool for assessing a radar's performance is the ambiguity function.

Aboard the employed vessel, four corner-reflectors (CR) at different heights in forward and backward direction where mounted in order to measure the signature of the CRs along the inbound- and outbound trajectories. The parabolic wave equation modeling software TERPEM was used to model the propagation factor and to compare the measurements against the modeling. The characterization of the oceanographic and meteorological input parameters for the modeling was performed by a large number of sensors operated by the WTD 71. The present contribution provides additional evidence of previously observed propagation phenomena under different operating frequencies. The qualitative behavior of the experimental data was confirmed by established modeling and fits quite well at the location of the performed campaign.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sea measurements","Atmospheric measurements","Temperature measurement","Radar measurements","Sensors","Meteorological radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["meteorological radar","millimetre wave propagation","millimetre wave radar","parabolic equations","wave equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter wave propagation","sea surface","squirrel campaign","Baltic Sea","mittelgrund research vessel","Fraunhofer FHR MEMPHIS radar","Ka band","W band","corner reflector","CR","parabolic wave equation modeling software TERPEM","oceanographic input parameter characterization","meteorological input parameter characterization","WTD"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IRS.2015.7226386","publicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 16th International Radar Symposium (IRS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209173/7226207/07226386.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"304","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IRS.2015.7226386","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter wave propagation above the sea surface during the Squirrel campaign","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter wave propagation above the sea surface during the Squirrel campaign","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226386/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226386/","accessionNumber":"15413122","conferenceDate":"24-26 June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 June 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter wave propagation above the sea surface during the Squirrel campaign","confLoc":"Dresden, Germany","sourcePdf":"PID3662043Danklmayer.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039994S","chronDate":"24-26 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209173","isNumber":"7226207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209173","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7226207","articleId":"7226386","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"German Institute of Navigation (DGON)","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7226389,"authors":[{"name":"Johanna Guetlein-Holzer","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequente Felder und Schaltungen, Muenchen, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Johanna","lastName":"Guetlein-Holzer","id":"37085474407"},{"name":"Christian Speck","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequente Felder und Schaltungen, Muenchen, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Speck","id":"37085473749"},{"name":"Andreas Kirschner","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequente Felder und Schaltungen, Muenchen, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kirschner","id":"37885685700"},{"name":"Juergen Detlefsen","affiliation":["Fachgebiet Hochfrequente Felder und Schaltungen, Muenchen, GERMANY"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Detlefsen","id":"37301144300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-9540-4853-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2155-5745"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2155-5753"}],"articleNumber":"7226389","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":262},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Radar","Transmitting antennas","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","covariance matrices","CW radar","FM radar","millimetre wave antenna arrays","millimetre wave radar","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar signal processing","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["monopulse angular evaluation","FMCW MIMO millimetre-wave radar","sparse aperture configuration","receive antenna","phase monopulse principle","2D system capability","virtual array generation","azimuth information evaluation","signal covariance matrix","occurring phase ambiguities","system-inherent coupling"]}],"abstract":"This article reports on the principles of evaluation and the experimental results obtained by a mm-wave FMCW MIMO radar system with a sparse aperture con- figuration and an additional receive antenna for the application of the phase monopulse principle.

The model is a recurrent neural network in which it is supposed that synchronous behavior between small groups of input and output neurons has been learned as fragments of high-dimensional memory patterns, and depletion of neural connections results in chaotic wandering dynamics. Computer experiments show that when a strong oscillatory signal is applied to an input group in the chaotic regime, the signal is successfully transferred to the corresponding output group, although no correlation is observed between the input signal and the intermediary neurons. Signal transfer is also observed when multiple signals are applied simultaneously to separate input groups belonging to different memory attractors. In this sense simultaneous multichannel communications are realized, and the chaotic neural dynamics acts as a signal transfer medium in which the signal appears to be hidden.</para>","doi":"10.1162/NECO_a_00715","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1101","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720226/7226409/07226426.pdf","publicationTitle":"Neural Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226409","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Multichannel Signal Transfers via Chaos in a Recurrent Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226426/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Multichannel Signal Transfers via Chaos in a Recurrent Neural Network","volume":"27","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Multichannel Signal Transfers via Chaos in a Recurrent Neural Network","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00715.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054487S","chronDate":"May  2015","isNumber":"7226409","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"6","articleId":"7226426","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226461,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Flynn","affiliation":["Graduate Center, City University of New York, New York, NY 10016, U.S.A. tflynn@gradcenter.cuny.edu"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Flynn"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"7226461","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226461","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Supervised learning in recurrent neural networks involves two processes: the neuron activity from which gradients are estimated and the process on connection parameters induced by these measurements.

This permits echo responses to be shaped as simple sinusoids, Fourier-based waveforms, and many other complex, possibly nonperiodic, patterns that would not be feasible with other existing methods.

Design of such rules is usually done by experts in a time consuming trial-and-error process. Recently, evolutionary algorithms have been proposed to automate the design process. There are several possibilities to represent rules for this hyper-heuristic search. Because the representation determines the search neighborhood and the complexity of the rules that can be evolved, a suitable choice of representation is key for a successful evolutionary algorithm. In this paper we empirically compare three different representations, both numeric and symbolic, for automated rule design: A linear combination of attributes, a representation based on artificial neural networks, and a tree representation. Using appropriate evolutionary algorithms (CMA-ES for the neural network and linear representations, genetic programming for the tree representation), we empirically investigate the suitability of each representation in a dynamic stochastic job shop scenario. We also examine the robustness of the evolved dispatching rules against variations in the underlying job shop scenario, and visualize what the rules do, in order to get an intuitive understanding of their inner workings. Results indicate that the tree representation using an improved version of genetic programming gives the best results if many candidate rules can be evaluated, closely followed by the neural network representation that already leads to good results for small to moderate computational budgets. The linear representation is found to be competitive only for extremely small computational budgets.</para>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/EVCO_a_00131","doi":"10.1162/EVCO_a_00131","displayPublicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720222/7226471/07226472.pdf","startPage":"249","endPage":"277","publicationTitle":"Evolutionary Computation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyper-heuristic Evolution of Dispatching Rules: A Comparison of Rule Representations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","displayDocTitle":"Hyper-heuristic Evolution of Dispatching Rules: A Comparison of Rule Representations","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226472/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyper-heuristic Evolution of Dispatching Rules: A Comparison of Rule Representations","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00131.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037432S","chronDate":"June  2015","isNumber":"7226471","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"21","articleId":"7226472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-08-11"},{"_id":7226482,"authors":[{"name":"K.

We define an experiment design and analysis method to determine relative importance and effective settings for control parameters of any evolutionary algorithm, and we apply this method to a classic binary-encoded genetic algorithm (GA). Subsequently, as reported elsewhere, we applied the GA, with the control parameter settings determined here, to steer a population of cloud-computing simulators toward behaviors that reveal degraded performance and system collapse. GA-steered simulators could serve as a design tool, empowering system engineers to identify and mitigate low-probability, costly failure scenarios. In the existing GA literature, we uncovered conflicting opinions and evidence regarding key GA control parameters and effective settings to adopt. Consequently, we designed and executed an experiment to determine relative importance and effective settings for seven GA control parameters, when applied across a set of numerical optimization problems drawn from the literature. This paper describes our experiment design, analysis, and results. We found that crossover most significantly influenced GA success, followed by mutation rate and population size and then by rerandomization point and elite selection.

Such networks learn the principal subspace, in the sense of principal component analysis, by adjusting synaptic weights according to activity-dependent learning rules. When derived from a principled cost function, these rules are nonlocal and hence biologically implausible. At the same time, biologically plausible local rules have been postulated rather than derived from a principled cost function. Here, to bridge this gap, we derive a biologically plausible network for subspace learning on streaming data by minimizing a principled cost function. In a departure from previous work, where cost was quantified by the representation, or reconstruction, error, we adopt a multidimensional scaling cost function for streaming data. The resulting algorithm relies only on biologically plausible Hebbian and anti-Hebbian local learning rules. In a stochastic setting, synaptic weights converge to a stationary state, which projects the input data onto the principal subspace. If the data are generated by a nonstationary distribution, the network can track the principal subspace. Thus, our result makes a step toward an algorithmic theory of neural computation.</para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226488/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Hebbian/Anti-Hebbian Neural Network for Linear Subspace Learning: A Derivation from Multidimensional Scaling of Streaming Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hebbian/Anti-Hebbian Neural Network for Linear Subspace Learning: A Derivation from Multidimensional Scaling of Streaming Data","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00745.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029434S","chronDate":"July  2015","isNumber":"7226486","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"15","articleId":"7226488","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":7226489,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Eduardo de Andrade","affiliation":["Institute of Computing, University of Campinas, Avenida Albert Einstein 1251, Campinas, SP 13083-852, Brazil andrade@ic.unicamp.br / ce.andrade@gmail.com"],"firstName":"Carlos Eduardo","lastName":"de Andrade"},{"name":"Rodrigo Franco Toso","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, 110 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA rtoso@cs.rutgers.edu"],"firstName":"Rodrigo Franco","lastName":"Toso"},{"name":"Mauricio G.

An experimental evaluation compares the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms with the standard mixed linear integer programming formulation, a specialized exact algorithm, and the best-performing heuristics proposed for this problem.

A new definition of stability is proposed and an order-2 stable region is obtained. Several existing stable analyses for canonical PSO are compared, especially their definitions of stability and the corresponding stable regions. It is shown that the classical stagnation assumption is too strict and not necessary. Moreover, among all these definitions of stability, it is shown that our definition requires the weakest conditions, and additional conditions bring no benefit. Finally, numerical experiments are reported to show that the obtained stable region is meaningful.

Network neuroscience is a rapidly growing field that is providing considerable insight into human structural connectivity, functional connectivity while at rest, changes in functional networks over time (dynamics), and how these properties differ in clinical populations. In addition, a number of studies have begun to quantify network characteristics in a variety of cognitive processes and provide a context for understanding cognition from a network perspective. In this review, we outline the contributions of network science to cognitive neuroscience. We describe the methodology of network science as applied to the particular case of neuroimaging data and review its uses in investigating a range of cognitive functions including sensory processing, language, emotion, attention, cognitive control, learning, and memory. In conclusion, we discuss current frontiers and the specific challenges that must be overcome to integrate these complementary disciplines of network science and cognitive neuroscience. Increased communication between cognitive neuroscientists and network scientists could lead to significant discoveries under an emerging scientific intersection known as cognitive network neuroscience.</para>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Network Neuroscience","publicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","doi":"10.1162/jocn_a_00810","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/6720218/7226508/07226529.pdf","startPage":"1471","endPage":"1491","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_00810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226508","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226529","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226529/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Network Neuroscience","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"8","dateOfInsertion":"27 August 2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Network Neuroscience","sourcePdf":"jocn_a_00810.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029366S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","isNumber":"7226508","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720218","citationCount":"8","articleId":"7226529","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7226558,"authors":[{"name":"Dorian Florescu","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S1 3JD, U.K. dorian.florescu@sheffield.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Dorian","lastName":"Florescu"},{"name":"Daniel Coca","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, S1 3JD, U.K. d.coca@sheffield.ac.uk"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Coca"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0899-7667"}],"articleNumber":"7226558","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Reconstruction Framework for Time-Encoded Signals with Integrate-and-Fire Neurons","abstract":"<para xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Integrate-and-fire neurons are time encoding machines that convert the amplitude of an analog signal into a nonuniform, strictly increasing sequence of spike times. Under certain conditions, the encoded signals can be reconstructed from the nonuniform spike time sequences using a time decoding machine. Time encoding and time decoding methods have been studied using the nonuniform sampling theory for band-limited spaces, as well as for generic shift-invariant spaces. This letter proposes a new framework for studying IF time encoding and decoding by reformulating the IF time encoding problem as a uniform sampling problem. This framework forms the basis for two new algorithms for reconstructing signals from spike time sequences.

We look to exploit small cell distances to simplify SBS design, particularly considering dense indoor installations. We compare theoretical results, based on a link budget analysis, with the system simulation of a densely deployed indoor network using appropriate mmWave channel propagation conditions. The frequency diverse bands of 28 and 72 GHz of the mmWave spectrum are assumed in the analysis. We investigate the performance of low-complexity approaches using a minimal number of antennas at the base station and the user equipment. Using the appropriate power consumption models and the state-of-the-art sub-component power usage, we determine the total power consumption and the energy efficiency of such systems. With mmWave being typified nonline-of-sight communication, we further investigate and propose the use of direct sequence spread spectrum as a means to overcome this, and discuss the use of multipath detection and combining as a suitable mechanism to maximize link reliability.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2473661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2473661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07226781.pdf","startPage":"1562","endPage":"1572","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Insights and Approaches for Low-Complexity 5G Small-Cell Base-Station Design for Indoor Dense Networks","topic":"Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Insights and Approaches for Low-Complexity 5G Small-Cell Base-Station Design for Indoor Dense Networks","volume":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226781/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15443735","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226781/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Insights and Approaches for Low-Complexity 5G Small-Cell Base-Station Design for Indoor Dense Networks","sourcePdf":"access-muirhead-2473661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065933S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks"],"articleId":"7226781","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-27"},{"_id":7226783,"authors":[{"name":"Ijaz Ahmad","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7331734/7226783/ahmad-2474118-small.gif","p":["\n\nIjaz Ahmad received the M.Sc.

The network intelligence and state are logically centralized and the underlying network infrastructure is abstracted from applications. SDN enhances network security by means of global visibility of the network state where a conflict can be easily resolved from the logically centralized control plane. Hence, the SDN architecture empowers networks to actively monitor traffic and diagnose threats to facilitates network forensics, security policy alteration, and security service insertion. The separation of the control and data planes, however, opens security challenges, such as man-in-the middle attacks, denial of service (DoS) attacks, and saturation attacks. In this paper, we analyze security threats to application, control, and data planes of SDN. The security platforms that secure each of the planes are described followed by various security approaches for network-wide security in SDN. SDN security is analyzed according to security dimensions of the ITU-T recommendation, as well as, by the costs of security solutions. In a nutshell, this paper highlights the present and future security challenges in SDN and future directions for secure SDN.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2015.2474118","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2015.2474118","startPage":"2317","endPage":"2346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7331734/07226783.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7331734","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Security in Software Defined Networks: A Survey","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Security in Software Defined Networks: A Survey","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15602574","publicationDate":"Fourthquarter 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226783/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Security in Software Defined Networks: A Survey","sourcePdf":"comst-ahmad-2474118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.335878S","chronDate":"Fourthquarter  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7331734","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"235","xplore-issue":"7331734","articleId":"7226783","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7226785,"authors":[{"name":"Jincheng Lin","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Acoustics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jincheng","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085415464"},{"name":"Xiaochuan Ma","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Acoustics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaochuan","lastName":"Ma","id":"37405313400"},{"name":"Shefeng Yan","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Acoustics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shefeng","lastName":"Yan","id":"37398108600"},{"name":"Chengpeng Hao","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Institute of Acoustics, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chengpeng","lastName":"Hao","id":"37305719900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"7226785","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":885},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226785","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Time-frequency analysis","Signal processing algorithms","Chirp"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["far-field narrowband signals","ULA","uniform linear array","spatial t-f distribution matrix","t-f MI estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique","direction of arrival estimation","DOA estimation","time-frequency multi invariance ESPRIT algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation","Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT)","multi-invariance (MI)","time-frequency  $(t{\\hbox{-}}f)$"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, a new ESPRIT-type algorithm is presented for estimating the direction of arrival (DOA).

In addition, the spatially robust formulation shows significantly improved numerical robustness, indicating improved ability in tolerating intrinsic array errors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"23","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15432912","htmlLink":"/document/7226792/","displayDocTitle":"Spatially Robust Far-field Beamforming Using the von Mises(-Fisher) Distribution","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003524","fundingName":"Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatially Robust Far-field Beamforming Using the von Mises(-Fisher) Distribution","sourcePdf":"taslp-anderson-2473684-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077592S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7243388","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7243388","articleId":"7226792","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7226798,"authors":[{"name":"Mehiar Dabbagh","affiliation":["Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/8306164/7226798/dabba-2473675-small.gif","p":["Mehiar Dabbagh received the B.S. degree in telecommunication engineering from the University of Aleppo, Syria, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon, in 2012.

The method does not require phase-measurement or rotation of the antenna under test (AUT). It is thus ideal for waveguide-based frequency bands. In contrast to conventional methods, we use reflection-only measurements, utilizing readily available geometries, such as a PEC-plate and a PEC-dihedral corner reflector, to estimate the co- and cross-polarized gain of the AUT. Predicted error using this approach is less than 0.07 dB for the co-pol and 0.26 dB for the cross-pol for an AUT with 17 dBi gain at 100 GHz. Experimental results for a radial line slot array antenna, operating in F-band, show good agreement between the conventional method, and that proposed using phase-less method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226799/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15489042","htmlLink":"/document/7226799/","displayDocTitle":"Novel Phaseless Gain Characterization for Circularly Polarized Antennas at mm-Wave and THz Frequencies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel Phaseless Gain Characterization for Circularly Polarized Antennas at mm-Wave and THz Frequencies","sourcePdf":"tap-bhardwaj-2473685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101151S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7287836","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7287836","articleId":"7226799","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7226800,"authors":[{"name":"Cho-Kang Hsu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Cho-Kang","lastName":"Hsu","id":"37983136900"},{"name":"Shyh-Jong Chung","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao-Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shyh-Jong","lastName":"Chung","id":"37278469100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7226800","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1821},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Slot antennas","Antenna measurements","Bandwidth","Feeds","Metals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","antenna feeds","antenna radiation patterns","cellular radio","mobile handsets","multifrequency antennas","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile handsets","conducting edge","compact multiband antenna fed","microstrip coupling","U-shaped loop","inserted open-end T-shaped slot","compact antenna area","resonant modes","loop mode","slot mode","monopole mode","GSM","DCS","PCS","UMTS","FDD-LTE bands","radiation characteristics","inserted slot antenna","frequency 824 MHz to 960 MHz","frequency 1710 MHz to 1880 MHz","frequency 1850 MHz to 1990 MHz","frequency 1920 MHz to 2170 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cellular phone antennas","handset antenna","mobile phone antennas","multiband antenna","slot antenna"]},{"kwd":["Cellular phone antennas","handset antenna","mobile phone antennas","multiband antenna","slot antenna"]}],"abstract":"This communication proposes a compact multiband antenna fed by microstrip coupling for handsets with conducting edge applications.

The proposed design is based on a CP unit-cell with simulated insertion loss of 0.2 dB at 30 GHz. In order to improve the axial ratio (AR) bandwidth, the sequential rotation technique is applied to the full array configuration. A model based on a hybrid in-house simulation tool is also proposed to predict accurately the array performance. The realized prototype, formed by 400 unit-cells, has 1 bit of phase resolution. The measured broadside gain is 22.8 dBi at 30 GHz with a 3-dB bandwidth of 20% in right-handed CP (RHCP).

Specifically, we investigate energy-efficient dispatching policy for VSaaS under N-version protection, which dispatches a file to multiple service engines for scanning in parallel to reduce the missed detection error cost. However, the benefit of N-version protection is at the cost of increasing energy consumption and the queue length of service engines. To manage this tradeoff, we aim to reduce the energy consumption of service engines and the missed detection error cost, while satisfying the queue stability for VSaaS. We formulate the file-scan dispatching policy as a stochastic optimization problem, and then propose an online algorithm to dispatch file-scan requests under N-version protection. We show that we can achieve the penalty function, i.e., the combination of the energy consumption and the missed detection error cost, arbitrarily close to the minimum but at the cost of increasing the queue length. Moreover, we compare the proposed dispatching algorithm with the K-least delay algorithm and show by simulation that the proposed dispatching algorithm is more energy efficient to provide N-version protection for VSaaS.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/8306164/07226806.pdf","startPage":"122","endPage":"134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards Virus Scanning as a Service in Mobile Cloud Computing: Energy-Efficient Dispatching Policy Under ${N}$ -Version Protection","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2015.2471852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8306164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2015.2471852","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226806/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Towards Virus Scanning as a Service in Mobile Cloud Computing: Energy-Efficient Dispatching Policy Under ${N}$ -Version Protection","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2018","accessionNumber":"17613419","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"6","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7226806/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001475","fundingName":"Nanyang Technological University under Start-Up Grant"},{"fundingName":"Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) through MOE Tier-1","grantNumber":"RG 17/14"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001447","fundingName":"Singapore Energy Market Authority","grantNumber":"EIRP02"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006112","fundingName":"Microsoft Research Asia"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004351","fundingName":"Cisco Systems, Inc"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards Virus Scanning as a Service in Mobile Cloud Computing: Energy-Efficient Dispatching Policy Under ${N}$ -Version Protection","sourcePdf":"tetc-zhang-2471852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099558S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"8306164","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"8306164","articleId":"7226806","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7226813,"authors":[{"name":"Taehoon Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Taehoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37071166900"},{"name":"Han Seung Jang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Han Seung","lastName":"Jang","id":"37085727080"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Dan Keun","lastName":"Sung","id":"37276225900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7226813","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1254},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Indexes","Resource management","Uplink","Optimization","Propagation delay","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","Internet of Things","multi-access systems","probability","resource allocation","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["enhanced random access scheme","spatial group","reusable preamble allocation","ERA-SGRPA scheme","machine-to-machine communications","cellular M2M Networks","Internet of Things","IoT","machine nodes","human-to-human communications","H2H communications","preamble resources","collision probability","access delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine-to-machine","cellular networks","random access","group","preamble reuse"]},{"kwd":["Machine-to-machine","cellular networks","random access","group","preamble reuse"]}],"abstract":"In the near future, cellular machine-to-machine (M2M) communications are expected to play an important role to realize the Internet of Things (IoT). Due to the exponentially growing number of machine nodes, however, one of challenging issues is to accommodate their random access (RA) requests without severely degrading the performance of human-to-human (H2H) communications. In this letter, we propose an enhanced RA scheme with spatial group based reusable preamble allocation (ERA-SGRPA), which reuses the preamble resources based on a spatial grouping during the RA procedure. By allocating the identical preamble set to the groups which are far apart from each other, the ERA-SGRPA scheme enables the given preamble set to be efficiently reused. The performance evaluation shows that the ERA-SGRPA scheme significantly lowers the collision probability and reduces the access delay and can accommodate a significantly larger number of machine nodes without degrading the performance of H2H communications.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2473860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7294672/07226813.pdf","startPage":"1714","endPage":"1717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2473860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Enhanced Random Access Scheme With Spatial Group Based Reusable Preamble Allocation in Cellular M2M Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226813","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"An Enhanced Random Access Scheme With Spatial Group Based Reusable Preamble Allocation in Cellular M2M Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226813/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15520406","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226813/","volume":"19","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIP)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)","grantNumber":"2014R1A2A2A01005192"},{"fundingName":"Climate Change Research Hub (CRH) Project of the KAIST EEWS Research Center","grantNumber":"EEWS-2015-N01150033"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Enhanced Random Access Scheme With Spatial Group Based Reusable Preamble Allocation in Cellular M2M Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-sung-2473860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122608S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7294672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7294672","articleId":"7226813","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7226830,"authors":[{"name":"Mojtaba Seyedhosseini","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7445283/7226830/seyed-small.gif","p":["Mojtaba Seyedhosseini received the B.S. degree in Electrical\n Engineering from the University of Tehran in 2007, and the M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Sharif\n University of Technology in 2009.

It unifies the image segmentation and object recognition problems. The importance of using contextual information in semantic segmentation frameworks has been widely realized in the field. We propose a contextual framework, called contextual hierarchical model (CHM), which learns contextual information in a hierarchical framework for semantic segmentation. At each level of the hierarchy, a classifier is trained based on downsampled input images and outputs of previous levels. Our model then incorporates the resulting multi-resolution contextual information into a classifier to segment the input image at original resolution. This training strategy allows for optimization of a joint posterior probability at multiple resolutions through the hierarchy. Contextual hierarchical model is purely based on the input image patches and does not make use of any fragments or shape examples. Hence, it is applicable to a variety of problems such as object segmentation and edge detection. We demonstrate that CHM performs at par with state-of-the-art on Stanford background and Weizmann horse datasets. It also outperforms state-of-the-art edge detection methods on NYU depth dataset and achieves state-of-the-art on Berkeley segmentation dataset (BSDS 500).","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2473846","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7445283/07226830.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7445283","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2473846","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","startPage":"951","endPage":"964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semantic Image Segmentation with Contextual Hierarchical Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Semantic Image Segmentation with Contextual Hierarchical Models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226830/","volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7226830/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 May 2016","accessionNumber":"15887581","pubMedId":"26336116","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"NIH","grantNumber":"1R01NS075314-01"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"IIS-1149299(TT)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semantic Image Segmentation with Contextual Hierarchical Models","sourcePdf":"tpami-seyedhosseini-2473846-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201608S","chronDate":"May 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7445283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7445283","articleId":"7226830","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7226832,"authors":[{"name":"Hong-Gui Han","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Computational Intelligence and Intelligent System, College of Electronic and Control Engineering, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China","Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7384789/7226832/han-2465174-small.gif","p":["Hong-Gui Han (M\u201911\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.E. degree in automatic from the Civil Aviation University of China, Tianjin, China, in 2005, and the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the Beijing University of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2007 and 2011, respectively.","He has been with the Beijing University of Technology since 2011, where he is currently a Professor.

The proposed SR-RBF neural network is represented in a general nonlinear form for predicting the future dynamic behaviors of nonlinear systems. To improve the modeling accuracy, a spiking-based growing and pruning algorithm and an adaptive learning algorithm are developed to tune the structure and parameters of the SR-RBF neural network, respectively. Meanwhile, for the control problem, an improved gradient method is utilized for the solution of the optimization problem in NMPC. The stability of the resulting control system is proved based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the proposed SR-RBF neural network-based NMPC (SR-RBF-NMPC) is used to control the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in a wastewater treatment process (WWTP). Comparisons with other existing methods demonstrate that the SR-RBF-NMPC can achieve a considerably better model fitting for WWTP and a better control performance for DO concentration.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2465174","startPage":"402","endPage":"415","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7384789/07226832.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2465174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Based on a Self-Organizing Recurrent Neural Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological neural networks","Recurrent neural networks","Nonlinear systems","Predictive models","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","predictive control","radial basis function networks","recurrent neural nets","self-organising feature maps","wastewater treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear model predictive control","SR-RBF-NMPC","self-organizing recurrent radial basis function neural network","future dynamic behaviors","nonlinear systems","spiking-based growing algorithm","pruning algorithm","improved gradient method","Lyapunov stability theory","dissolved oxygen concentration","wastewater treatment process","WWTP","DO concentration"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration","nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)","recurrent radial basis function (SR-RBF) neural networks","self-organizing","wastewater treatment process (WWTP)."]},{"kwd":["Dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration","nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)","recurrent radial basis function (SR-RBF) neural networks","self-organizing","wastewater treatment process (WWTP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Based on a Self-Organizing Recurrent Neural Network","volume":"27","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7226832/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15721756","pubMedId":"26336152","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005090","fundingName":"Beijing Nova Program","grantNumber":"Z131104000413007"},{"fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation through the Hong Kong Scholar Program","grantNumber":"2014M550017 and XJ2013018"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Science and Technology Project","grantNumber":"Z141100001414005 and Z141101004414058"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203099, 61225016 and 61533002"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Program Foundation from Ministry of Chinese Education","grantNumber":"20121103120020"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Municipal Education Commission Foundation","grantNumber":"km201410005001 and KZ201410005002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Based on a Self-Organizing Recurrent Neural Network","sourcePdf":"tnnls-han-2465174-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154675S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7384789","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7384789","articleId":"7226832","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7226835,"authors":[{"name":"Jianming Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Boston University, Boston, MA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7445283/7226835/zhang-2473844-small.gif","p":["Jianming Zhang received the bachelor's and master's degrees\n in mathematics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In our formulation, an image is characterized by a set of binary images, which are generated by randomly thresholding the image's feature maps in a whitened feature space. Based on a Gestalt principle of figure-ground segregation, BMS computes a saliency map by discovering surrounded regions via topological analysis of Boolean maps. Furthermore, we draw a connection between BMS and the Minimum Barrier Distance to provide insight into why and how BMS can properly captures the surroundedness cue via Boolean maps. The strength of BMS is verified by its simplicity, efficiency and superior performance compared with 10 state-of-the-art methods on seven eye tracking benchmark datasets.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2473844","startPage":"889","endPage":"902","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7445283/07226835.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2473844","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7445283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Surroundedness for Saliency Detection: A Boolean Map Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Computational modeling","Visualization","Predictive models","Transforms","Pattern recognition","Machine intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","gaze tracking","image segmentation","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eye fixation prediction surroundedness","Boolean Map-based saliency detection model","binary images","random image thresholding","image feature maps","whitened feature space","Gestalt principle","figure-ground segregation","BMS","surrounded region discovery","topological analysis","minimum barrier distance","eye tracking benchmark datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Saliency detection","Boolean map","eye fixation prediction","minimum barrier distance"]},{"kwd":["Saliency detection","Boolean map","eye fixation prediction","minimum barrier distance"]}],"chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/34/7445283/7226835-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226835/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Surroundedness for Saliency Detection: A Boolean Map Approach","volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7226835/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2016","accessionNumber":"15887583","pubMedId":"26336114","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"US National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1059218 and 1029430"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Exploiting Surroundedness for Saliency Detection: A Boolean Map Approach","sourcePdf":"tpami-zhang-2473844-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145693S","chronDate":"May 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7445283","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"143","xplore-issue":"7445283","articleId":"7226835","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-12"},{"_id":7226836,"authors":[{"name":"Selma Belhadj Amor","affiliation":["Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique, Lyon, France"],"bio":{"p":["Selma Belhadj Amor (S\u201913\u2013M\u201915) received the B.Sc. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering (with distinction) in 2009 and 2011, respectively, from Grenoble-INP Ensimag, Grenoble, France.

By dual here we mean: (1) the channel matrices of the MAC and the BC are transposes of each other and (2) the same total input-power constraint P is imposed on both the channels. We also present multi-letter expressions for the linear-feedback capacity regions of the two channels, i.e., for the set of all rates that are achievable with the linear-feedback coding schemes. We identify a sub-class of MAC and BC linear-feedback coding schemes that achieve the respective linear-feedback capacity regions, and within these subclasses, we identify pairs of MAC and BC coding schemes that achieve the same rate regions. In the two-user case, when the transmitters or the receiver are single-antenna, the capacity region for the Gaussian MAC is known [20], [15] and the capacity-achieving scheme is a linear-feedback coding scheme. With our results, we can thus determine the linear-feedback capacity region of the two-user Gaussian BC when either transmitter or receivers are single-antenna and we can identify the corresponding linear-feedback capacity-achieving coding schemes. Our results show that the control-theory inspired linear-feedback coding scheme by Elia [11], Wu et al. [30], and Ardestanizadeh et al. [1] is sumrate optimal among all the linear-feedback coding schemes for the symmetric single-antenna Gaussian BC with equal channel gains. More generally, we show that the linear-feedback sum-capacity of the scalar Gaussian BC with independent noises is achieved using a simple rearrangement of Ozarow's MAC encodings and decodings. In the K 3-user case, Kramer [16] and Ardestanizadeh et al. [2] determined the linear-feedback sum-capacity for the symmetric single-antenna Gaussian MAC with equal channel gains. Using our duality result, in this paper, we identify the linear-feedback sum-capacity for the K 3-user single-antenna Gaussian BC with equal channel gains. It is equal to the sum-rate achieved by Ardestanizadeh et al.'s linear-feedback coding scheme [1].","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2473838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7299738/07226836.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2473838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299738","startPage":"5976","endPage":"5998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO MAC-BC Duality With Linear-Feedback Coding Schemes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO MAC-BC Duality With Linear-Feedback Coding Schemes","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226836/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"61","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524617","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226836/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"City of Paris through the Emergences Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003977","fundingName":"Israel Science Foundation","grantNumber":"684/11"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO MAC-BC Duality With Linear-Feedback Coding Schemes","sourcePdf":"tit-belhadjamor-2473838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173165S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7299738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7299738","articleId":"7226836","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7226838,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Jin Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/19/7317673/7226838/chang-2444260-small.gif","p":["Seung Jin Chang received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering.","He has been a Research Assistant with the Control Engineering Laboratory, Yonsei University, since 2010.

Time delay information in the reflected signal is transformed to the instantaneous beat angular frequency by stretching process and the instantaneous beat angular frequency is estimated by Kalman smoother in order to obtain the high resolution time-frequency spectrum of the nonstationary signal. Based on the estimated instantaneous beat angular frequency, the magnitude and phase difference of the reflection coefficient are estimated by Kalman filtering. To verify the performance of the proposed method, comparative experiments are conducted to detect and to locate the splice under different conditions in comparison with traditional time-domain reflectometry method and the proposed method. In addition, to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, the experiments are carried out for the assessment of state of the shunt and serial faults on cable under test. The location and reflection coefficient of a nominal, water submerged, an opened splice, shunt fault and serial fault (10 \u03a9, 30 \u03a9, 50 \u03a9, 70 \u03a9, 90 \u03a9, 1 k\u03a9) are estimated by the proposed method. The proposed method exhibits advantages in that it uses the pulse compression to improve the range resolution and SNR of reflectometer simultaneously, and the proposed technique can accurately assess the state of the fault, which is closed to short fault or open fault.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7226838/","accessionNumber":"15583797","displayDocTitle":"Condition Monitoring of Instrumentation Cable Splices Using Kalman Filtering","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea through the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning","grantNumber":"NRF-2012M2A8A4055236 and NRF-2014R1A2A1A01004780"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Condition Monitoring of Instrumentation Cable Splices Using Kalman Filtering","sourcePdf":"tim-shin-2444260-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070339S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7317673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7317673","articleId":"7226838","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7226840,"authors":[{"name":"Ko-Jen Hsiao","affiliation":["WhisperText, Venice, CA, USA","University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7470313/7226840/hsiao-2466686-small.gif","p":["Ko-Jen Hsiao received the B.A.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2008, and the master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering with a minor in systems and applied mathematics and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.","He is currently a Data Scientist and an Applied Researcher in machine learning with WhisperText, Venice, CA, USA.

Similarity-based anomaly detection algorithms detect abnormally large amounts of similarity or dissimilarity, e.g., as measured by the nearest neighbor Euclidean distances between a test sample and the training samples. In many application domains, there may not exist a single dissimilarity measure that captures all possible anomalous patterns. In such cases, multiple dissimilarity measures can be defined, including nonmetric measures, and one can test for anomalies by scalarizing using a nonnegative linear combination of them. If the relative importance of the different dissimilarity measures are not known in advance, as in many anomaly detection applications, the anomaly detection algorithm may need to be executed multiple times with different choices of weights in the linear combination. In this paper, we propose a method for similarity-based anomaly detection using a novel multicriteria dissimilarity measure, the Pareto depth. The proposed Pareto depth analysis (PDA) anomaly detection algorithm uses the concept of Pareto optimality to detect anomalies under multiple criteria without having to run an algorithm multiple times with different choices of weights. The proposed PDA approach is provably better than using linear combinations of the criteria, and shows superior performance on experiments with synthetic and real data sets.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicriteria Similarity-Based Anomaly Detection Using Pareto Depth Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2466686","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7470313/07226840.pdf","startPage":"1307","endPage":"1321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2466686","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7470313","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226840","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226840/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","displayDocTitle":"Multicriteria Similarity-Based Anomaly Detection Using Pareto Depth Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7226840/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16002806","pubMedId":"26336154","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-09-1-0310 and W911NF-12-1-0443"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicriteria Similarity-Based Anomaly Detection Using Pareto Depth Analysis","sourcePdf":"tnnls-hsiao-2466686-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122419S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7470313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7470313","articleId":"7226840","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7226844,"authors":[{"name":"Kongming Sun","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Key Laboratory of Power System Intelligent Dispatch and Control (Shandong University), Jinan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/7518698/7226844/7226844-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kongming Sun was born in Weifang, Shandong Province, China, on February 10, 1989.

Relying on radio measurements using a 4 \u00d7 30 multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system at 5.3 GHz, this paper presents the results of an empirical study of V2V propagation channels in two suburban crossroad scenarios, where vehicles are either moving in the same direction and separate from each other along different roads or pass each other in opposite directions at the crossing. The quasi-stationarity interval is first characterized using correlation matrix distance (CMD). Small-scale fading follows a Nakagami distribution based on the Akaike information criteria (AIC). Delay and angular dispersions are found to be significantly affected by the type of crossroad and the presence of an LOS. Cross-correlation coefficients between delay dispersion, angular dispersion, and small-scale fading behavior are also evaluated. By comparing the results of the different crossroads, it is found that the delay and angular dispersions are large in the first type of crossroad. By contrast, in the second type of crossroad, small delay and angular dispersions are observed due to road bending and obstruction by roadside trees.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07226856.pdf","startPage":"5850","endPage":"5861","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2473687","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2473687","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vehicle-to-Vehicle Radio Channel Characterization in Crossroad Scenarios","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Fading","Roads","Antenna arrays","Vehicles","Buildings","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collision avoidance","MIMO communication","mobile communication","Nakagami channels","radiowave propagation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle-to-vehicle radio channel characterization","vehicle-to-vehicle-communication-based collision avoidance systems","collision course","line of sight","buildings","roadside infrastructures","road bending","radio measurements","multiple-input-multiple-output system","MIMO system","V2V propagation channels","suburban crossroad scenarios","quasistationarity interval","correlation matrix distance","small-scale fading","Nakagami distribution","Akaike information criteria","angular dispersions","delay dispersion","roadside trees","frequency 5.3 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel characterization","crossroad","propagation","vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Vehicle-to-Vehicle Radio Channel Characterization in Crossroad Scenarios","volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7226856/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16209984","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501020"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2015M570030"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005023","fundingName":"State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety","grantNumber":"RCS2015ZQ003 , RCS2015ZZ001 and RCS2014ZZ03"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2015RC025  and 2014JBZ021"},{"fundingName":"Chinese Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"313006"},{"fundingName":"National 863 Project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A706"},{"fundingName":"Belgian Fonds Special de la Recherche Scientifique (FRS)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vehicle-to-Vehicle Radio Channel Characterization in Crossroad Scenarios","sourcePdf":"tvt-he-2473687-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1756S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7226856","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7226864,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel Asensio","affiliation":["E.T.S. de Ingenieros Industriales, University of Castilla\u2014La Mancha, Ciudad Real, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7456360/7226864/asens-2469134-small.gif","p":["Miguel Asensio received the M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering and power systems from the Polytechnic University of Madrid, Madrid, Spain, in 2003, and Comillas University, Madrid, in 2013, respectively.

At the same time, they are increasing their renewable penetration and, therefore, risk for electric utilities. Integrating stochastic energy resources in noninterconnected systems may take advantage of an intelligent and optimized risk-averse unit commitment (UC) model. This paper presents a two-stage stochastic UC model with high renewable penetration including reserve requirements for the efficient management of uncertainty. In order to account for the uncertainty around the true outcomes of load, wind, and photovoltaic (PV) generation, a minimum conditional value at risk term has been included in the model formulation. A stochastic measure of the value of the stochastic solution is used to evaluate the benefits of using stochastic programming. The model considers the need for reserves dependent on the forecasting horizon and the amount of renewable generation. Active power demand, and wind and PV generations are considered as probability distribution functions. The model is applied to the Lanzarote-Fuerteventura system in the Canary Islands, Spain, and Crete, Greece.","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2469134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7456360/07226864.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2469134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7456360","startPage":"1356","endPage":"1367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Unit Commitment in Isolated Systems With Renewable Penetration Under CVaR Assessment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Unit Commitment in Isolated Systems With Renewable Penetration Under CVaR Assessment","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15934868","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7226864/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union 7th Framework Programme 2007\u20132013","grantNumber":"309048"},{"fundingName":"Project SiNGULAR"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science of Spain","grantNumber":"CICYT Project ENE2012-30679"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Unit Commitment in Isolated Systems With Renewable Penetration Under CVaR Assessment","sourcePdf":"tsg-contreras-2469134-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097931S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7456360","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7456360","articleId":"7226864","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7226868,"authors":[{"name":"Shouyi Yin","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7226868/yin-2462752-small.gif","p":["Shouyi Yin (M\u201908) received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in electronics engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2000, 2002, and 2005, respectively.","He has been with Imperial College London, London, U.K., as a Research Associate.

In this paper, we propose a configurable parallel architecture to improve the computing efficiency of integral histogram. Based on the configurable design in the architecture, multiple integral objects for integral histogram image, such as image intensity, image gradient, and local binary pattern, are well supported. Meanwhile, by means of the proposed strip-based memory partitioning mechanism, this architecture processes the integral histogram quickly with maximal parallelism in a pipeline manner. Besides, in this architecture, the proposed data correlation memory compression mechanism effectively solves the expansion problem of integral histogram memory caused by storing the histogram data. It fully reduces the data redundancy in the integral histograms, and saves a lot of memory resources. Experiments using Cyclone IV-based field-programmable gate array platform and 65-nm technology-based postsynthesis show that our architecture improves the average computing speed by 8.6 times with high power efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art works.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2462752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7436835/07226868.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2015.2462752","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7436835","startPage":"1305","endPage":"1318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Configurable Parallel Hardware Architecture for Efficient Integral Histogram Image Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226868","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Configurable Parallel Hardware Architecture for Efficient Integral Histogram Image Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226868/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"27 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15874317","dateOfInsertion":"18 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7226868/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61274131"},{"fundingName":"China Major Scientific and Technological Project","grantNumber":"2013ZX01033001-001-003"},{"fundingName":"International Science and Technology Cooperation Project of China","grantNumber":"2012DFA11170"},{"fundingName":"Tsinghua Indigenous Research Project","grantNumber":"20111080997"},{"fundingName":"China 863 Program","grantNumber":"2012AA012701"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Configurable Parallel Hardware Architecture for Efficient Integral Histogram Image Computing","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yin-2462752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150994S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7436835","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7436835","articleId":"7226868","onlineDate":"27 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7226871,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Schaef","affiliation":["Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth, Hanover, NH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7226871/7226871-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christopher Schaef (S\u201911) received the B.S degree in 2010 and the M.S. degree in 2011 in industrial engineering, both from Helmut-Schmidt University in Hamburg, Germany.

Switched capacitor (SC) converters have started to gain traction for a number of these applications, but are still subject to fundamental limitations that drive them towards expensive process options and high switching frequencies. Variable regulation is challenging with the SC approach, and comes at the cost of lower power density and efficiency. This work presents a resonant switched capacitor (ReSC) topology that addresses some of these challenges by introducing a small amount of inductance in series with the flying capacitor, eliminating charge-sharing losses and thus allowing efficient operation in a low-cost process option. The three-phase interleaved topology can deliver up to 7.7 W at 85% efficiency (power density of 0.91 W/mm \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n or 6.4 kW/in \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n) using a bootstrapped n-channel power train and single-digit nH inductors embedded in a flip-chip assembly.

CP-OFDM is nowadays most often the signal format of choice in wireless communication systems when serving multiple users. LTE/-A, WiFi and WiMAX have all adopted CP-OFDM due to its high degree of flexibility. Though, not all degrees of freedom have been exploited in those systems yet. While these systems are using tailored waveform parameters according to the respective setting - e.g. while WiFi is more tailored towards local area, 4G and WiMAX use settings more suited for wide area - 5G may go one step further by allowing for user specific settings within a single band. With allowing this the signal characteristics may be better matched to the respective channel characteristics such as high Doppler spreads and low coherence times. Our investigations have shown that with exploiting this degree of freedom a higher range of user velocities may be supported, especially with replacing CP-OFDM by UF-OFDM. UF-OFDM modifies the OFDM concept by subband-wise filtering, which mitigates inter-carrier interference (ICI) arising from different parallel subcarrier spacings. This makes it a natural fit for being combined with user-specific subcarrier spacings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subcarrier spacing - a neglected degree of freedom?","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7226999","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07226999.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7226999","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7226999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7226999/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Subcarrier spacing - a neglected degree of freedom?","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7226999/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15416977","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subcarrier spacing - a neglected degree of freedom?","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p56schaich.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055884S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7226999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227000,"authors":[{"name":"Dinh-Thuy Phan-Huy","affiliation":["Orange Labs, France"],"firstName":"Dinh-Thuy","lastName":"Phan-Huy","id":"38270008700"},{"name":"Pierre Siohan","affiliation":["Orange Labs, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Siohan","id":"37293775600"},{"name":"Maryline H\u00e9lard","affiliation":["UEB, IETR, France"],"firstName":"Maryline","lastName":"H\u00e9lard","id":"37269770700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227000","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receiving antennas","MIMO","Wireless communication","Encoding","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","space-time codes","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["make-it-real-and-anticirculating orthogonal space-time coding","MIMO system","OFDM","OQAM","space-time coding technique","MIRAAC","energy efficient wireless data transmission","equivalent MIMO channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM/OQAM","MIMO","space-time coding","maximum ratio transmission"]}],"abstract":"We propose an orthogonal and full rate MIMO space-time coding technique for OFDM/OQAM, called `make-it-real-and-anticirculating' (MIRAAC), to perform energy efficient wireless data transmission.

By allowing the filter length to exceed the cyclic prefix (CP) length of OFDM and designing the filter appropriately, the proposed f-OFDM waveform can achieve a desirable frequency localization for bandwidths as narrow as a few tens of subcarriers, while keeping the inter-symbol interference/inter-carrier interference (ISI/ICI) within an acceptable limit. Enabled by the proposed f-OFDM, an asynchronous filtered orthogonal frequency division multiple access (f-OFDMA)/filtered discrete-Fourier transform-spread OFDMA (f-DFT-S-OFDMA) scheme is introduced, which uses the spectrum shaping filter at each transmitter for side lobe leakage elimination and a bank of filters at the receiver for inter-user interference rejection. Per-user downsampling and short fast Fourier transform (FFT) are used at the receiver to ensure a reasonable complexity of implementation. The proposed scheme removes the inter-user time-synchronization overhead required in the synchronous OFDMA/DFT-S-OFDMA.

Frequency localization is considered as an important characteristic for future wireless communication systems, including 5G, but it comes with the cost of not-so-good time localization. This appears in the form of relatively long `tails' of the generated transmission burst. Truncation of the burst tails is an obvious choice for reducing the time-overheads in short burst based multiple access or duplexing schemes, but it introduces transients in the inband interference and out-of-band radiation characteristics. We study the burst truncation effects while utilizing a flexible FBMC waveform generation scheme based on fast-convolution processing. Also a novel method to optimize the used symbol waveform taking into account the truncation effects is developed.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227002.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227002","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized burst truncation in fast-convolution filter bank based waveform generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Distortion","Time-domain analysis","Wireless communication","Optimization","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","channel bank filters","convolution","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimized burst truncation","fast-convolution filter bank based waveform generation","time-frequency localization tradeoffs","filter bank multicarrier waveforms","short burst transmission","future wireless communication systems","transmission burst","burst tails","time-overheads","short burst based multiple access","duplexing schemes","inband interference","out-of-band radiation characteristics","flexible FBMC waveform generation scheme","fast-convolution processing","symbol waveform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227002/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimized burst truncation in fast-convolution filter bank based waveform generation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227002/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417096","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized burst truncation in fast-convolution filter bank based waveform generation","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p71ylikaakinen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041428S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227003,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Wunder","affiliation":["Technische Universit\u00e4t, Berlin","Fraunhofer Heinrich-Hertz-Institut, Berlin"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Wunder","id":"37283909500"},{"name":"Saeed Afrasiabi Gorgani","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Berlin, DE"],"firstName":"Saeed Afrasiabi","lastName":"Gorgani","id":"37077060800"},{"name":"Sofiane S.

A major challenge is to cope with highly asynchronous access as well as high carrier frequency offsets of low-cost IoT devices.

One possible architecture to reduce the number of RF chains is hybrid beamforming in which the overall beamformer consists of a concatenation of an analog RF beamformer implemented using phase shifters (PSs) and a low-dimensional baseband digital beamformer. However, conventional hybrid beamforming designs require high-resolution PSs, which are expensive. In this paper, we consider transceiver design for maximizing the spectral efficiency of a large-scale MIMO system with hybrid beamforming architecture where only finite-resolution PSs are available at both ends. We propose a heuristic transceiver design for the critical case where the number of RF chains is equal to the number of data streams. We show that the proposed hybrid beamforming design can achieve a rate close to that of optimal exhaustive search. We also suggest how to generalize the algorithm for the setting where the number of RF chains exceeds the number of data streams. We show that the generalized algorithm can use the extra RF chains to significantly improve the system performance in the case of low-resolution PSs.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227015","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227015.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid beamforming with finite-resolution phase shifters for large-scale MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227015","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid beamforming with finite-resolution phase shifters for large-scale MIMO systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227015/","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15417067","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227015/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid beamforming with finite-resolution phase shifters for large-scale MIMO systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p136sohrabi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056964S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227015","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7227016,"authors":[{"name":"Gilwon Lee","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gilwon","lastName":"Lee","id":"38241159400"},{"name":"Youngchul Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngchul","lastName":"Sung","id":"37286810600"},{"name":"Marios Kountouris","affiliation":["Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Lab, Huawei Technologies Co.

MmWave hybrid precoding overcomes this limitation by dividing the spatial signal processing between the radio frequency and baseband domains. Analog networks of phase shifters have been proposed to implement the radio frequency precoders, since they achieve a good compromise between complexity and performance. In this paper, we propose a low complexity hybrid precoding design for the architecture based on phase shifters. The new method is a greedy algorithm based on the orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm, but replacing the costly correlation operations over a dictionary with the element-wise normalization of the first singular vector of the residual. The main advantage is that the design avoids any assumption on the antenna array geometry. Additionally, numerical results show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of achievable spectral efficiency over other previous solutions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dictionary-free hybrid precoders and combiners for mmWave MIMO systems","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227018","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227018.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"155","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227018","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227018/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dictionary-free hybrid precoders and combiners for mmWave MIMO systems","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227018/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417017","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dictionary-free hybrid precoders and combiners for mmWave MIMO systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p151mendezrial.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062162S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227020,"authors":[{"name":"Youssef Jaffal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Jaffal","id":"37085647412"},{"name":"Youssef Nasser","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Nasser","id":"37294663300"},{"name":"Yoann Corre","affiliation":["Radio Department, SIRADEL, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Yoann","lastName":"Corre","id":"37268844500"},{"name":"Yves Lostanlen","affiliation":["SIRADEL, Wireless Expertise and Research Center, Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Lostanlen","id":"37268822600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227020","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","OFDM","Throughput","Signal processing algorithms","Conferences","Computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","integer programming","Long Term Evolution","multi-access systems","nonlinear programming","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-best branch and bound technique","mixed integer nonlinear programming","MINLP resource allocation","dynamic resource allocation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiuser downlink OFDM systems","computational complexity","user throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["K-best Branch and Bound","MINLP","OFDM","Resource Allocation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a simplified approach for the Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming (MINLP) problem in the context of dynamic resource allocation for multiuser downlink Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems.

Each AP uses local channel estimates obtained from received uplink pilots and applies conjugate beamforming to transmit data to the users. We derive a closed-form expression for the achievable rate. This expression enables us to design an optimal max-min power control scheme that gives equal quality of service to all users. We further compare the performance of the Cell-Free Massive MIMO system to that of a conventional small-cell network and show that the throughput of the Cell-Free system is much more concentrated around its median compared to that of the smallcell system. The Cell-Free Massive MIMO system can provide an almost 20-fold increase in 95%-likely per-user throughput, compared with the small-cell system. Furthermore, Cell-Free systems are more robust to shadow fading correlation than smallcell systems.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227028","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227028","startPage":"201","endPage":"205","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227028.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Uniformly great service for everyone","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227028/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Uniformly great service for everyone","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15417001","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7227028/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Uniformly great service for everyone","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p201ngo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05593S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227028","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7227029,"authors":[{"name":"Li You","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"You","id":"37085506624"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Xiqi","lastName":"Gao","id":"37277462600"},{"name":"A.

Based on a physically motivated channel model, we first establish a relationship between channel space-frequency correlations and the channel power angle-delay (AD) spectrum in the massive antenna array regime, which reveals the channel sparsity in massive MIMO-OFDM. With this channel model, we then investigate channel estimation (CE) for massive MIMO-OFDM with APSPs. We show that CE performance in terms of sum mean square error can be minimized if the user terminals' channel power distributions in the AD domain are non-overlapping with proper phase shift scheduling. The Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed APSP approach can provide substantial performance gains in terms of achievable spectral efficiency over the conventional phase shift orthogonal pilot approach in typical high mobility scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227029","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227029.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","startPage":"206","endPage":"210","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adjustable phase shift pilots for sparse massive MIMO-OFDM channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adjustable phase shift pilots for sparse massive MIMO-OFDM channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227029/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417039","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7227029/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adjustable phase shift pilots for sparse massive MIMO-OFDM channels","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p206you.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071649S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227030,"authors":[{"name":"Emil Bj\u00f6rnson","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Emil","lastName":"Bj\u00f6rnson","id":"37322949300"},{"name":"Luca Sanguinetti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria dell'Informazione, University of Pisa, Italy","LANEAS, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sanguinetti","id":"37269450000"},{"name":"Marios Kountouris","affiliation":["Mathematical and Algorithmic Sciences Lab, Huawei Technologies Co.

This interference ultimately limits the achievable rate when basic linear beamforming is used. We show how to push this limit by exploiting the statistical properties of the channel. Specifically, we use a lower bound on the achievable rate to formulate a rate balancing problem which is independent of the instantaneous channel state information but only depends on the second order information.

Since the spectral efficiency of these networks is limited by pilot contamination, the pilot allocation across cells is of paramount importance. However, finding efficient pilot reuse patterns is non-trivial especially in practical asymmetric base station deployments. In this paper, we approach this problem using coalitional game theory. Each cell has its own unique pilots and can form coalitions with other cells to gain access to more pilots. We develop a low-complexity distributed algorithm and prove convergence to an individually stable coalition structure. Simulations reveal fast algorithmic convergence and substantial performance gains over one-cell coalitions and full pilot reuse.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227034","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227034.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","startPage":"231","endPage":"235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot clustering in asymmetric massive MIMO networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot clustering in asymmetric massive MIMO networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227034/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417080","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7227034/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot clustering in asymmetric massive MIMO networks","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p231mochaourab.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061795S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227034","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227035,"authors":[{"name":"Junyeong Seo","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Junyeong","lastName":"Seo","id":"38569226500"},{"name":"Youngchul Sung","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youngchul","lastName":"Sung","id":"37286810600"},{"name":"Gilwon Lee","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Gilwon","lastName":"Lee","id":"38241159400"},{"name":"Donggun Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Donggun","lastName":"Kim","id":"38239621900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227035","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Receivers","Transmitters","Array signal processing","Millimeter wave technology","Markov processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Markov processes","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot beam sequence design","channel estimation","millimeter wave MIMO systems","POMDP framework","virtual channel","Markovian random walk","line-of-sight communication","partially observable Markov decision process"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Millimeter-wave","Large MIMO","Channel estimation","Partially Observable Markov Processes (POMDP)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, adaptive pilot beam sequence design for channel estimation in large millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems is considered. By exploiting the sparsity of mmWave MIMO channels with the virtual channel representation and imposing a Markovian random walk assumption on the physical movement of the line-of-sight (LOS) and reflection clusters, it is shown that the sparse channel estimation problem in large mmWave MIMO systems reduces to a sequential detection problem that finds the locations and values of the non-zero-valued bins in a two-dimensional rectangular grid, and the optimal adaptive pilot design problem can be cast into the framework of a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Under the POMDP framework, an optimal adaptive pilot beam sequence design method is obtained to maximize the accumulated transmission data rate for a given period of time. Numerical results are provided to validate our pilot signal design method and they show that the proposed method yields good performance.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227035","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227035.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227035","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","startPage":"236","endPage":"240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot beam sequence design for channel estimation in millimeter-wave MIMO systems: A POMDP framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Pilot beam sequence design for channel estimation in millimeter-wave MIMO systems: A POMDP framework","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227035/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417011","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7227035/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot beam sequence design for channel estimation in millimeter-wave MIMO systems: A POMDP framework","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p236seo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096922S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227035","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227036,"authors":[{"name":"Amirpasha Shirazinia","affiliation":["Signals & Systems Division, Uppsala University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Amirpasha","lastName":"Shirazinia","id":"37712578200"},{"name":"Subhrakanti Dey","affiliation":["Signals & Systems Division, Uppsala University, Sweden"],"firstName":"Subhrakanti","lastName":"Dey","id":"37085451771"},{"name":"Domenico Ciuonzo","affiliation":["University of Naples, Italy"],"firstName":"Domenico","lastName":"Ciuonzo","id":"37596948400"},{"name":"Pierluigi Salvo Rossi","affiliation":["Dept.

We optimize the amplification factor (or equivalently transmission power) at each sensor node in two different scenarios: 1) with the objective of total power minimization subject to mean square error (MSE) of source estimation constraint, and 2) with the objective of minimizing MSE subject to total power constraint. For this purpose, we apply an asymptotic approximation based on the massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) favorable propagation condition (when L \u226a N).

However, with multiple antennas on both ends, the MIMO setting requires global Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) (i.e. CSIT from the other transmitters (Tx) also). Though global CSIT can be organized within a cluster, it leads to significant fast CSIT acquisition overhead. In this paper we focus on the (dominant) multipath components in the MIMO propagation channels with only the slow fading components known to the Tx, corresponding to a structured form of covariance CSIT. The pathwise approach allows for a decomposition of the alignment tasks between Tx and receivers (Rx), leading to the sufficiency of local pathwise CSIT plus limited coordination overhead. To optimize Ergodic Weighted Sum Rate at finite SNR, we exploit the uplink/downlink duality to design the Tx beamformers as MMSE filters, in which averaging over complex path amplitudes leads to pathwise filters. We furthermore explore a relation between the difference of convex (DC) functions programming and the Weighted Sum MSE (WSMSE) approaches, indicating significant convergence speed potential for the former, and allowing a fixing of the latter for the case of partial CSIT.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227039","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227039.pdf","startPage":"256","endPage":"260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The pathwise MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227039/","displayDocTitle":"The pathwise MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15416961","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227039/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The pathwise MIMO Interfering Broadcast Channel","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p256tabikh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077926S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227040,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Moll\u00e9n","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering (ISY), Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Moll\u00e9n","id":"37085632512"},{"name":"Erik G.

In this context, physical layer multigroup multicasting under per-antenna power constrains, is investigated herein. To address this complex optimization problem low-complexity alternatives to semi-definite relaxation are proposed. The goal is to optimize the per-antenna power constrained transmitter in a maximum fairness sense, which is formulated as a non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic problem. Therefore, the recently developed tool of feasible point pursuit and successive convex approximation is extended to account for practical per-antenna power constraints. Interestingly, the novel iterative method exhibits not only superior performance in terms of approaching the relaxed upper bound but also a significant complexity reduction, as the dimensions of the optimization variables increase. Consequently, multicast multigroup beamforming for large-scale array transmitters with per-antenna dedicated amplifiers is rendered computationally efficient and accurate. A preliminary performance evaluation in large-scale systems for which the semi-definite relaxation constantly yields non rank-1 solutions is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multicast multigroup beamforming for per-antenna power constrained large-scale arrays","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227042","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227042.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227042/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multicast multigroup beamforming for per-antenna power constrained large-scale arrays","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227042/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15416965","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multicast multigroup beamforming for per-antenna power constrained large-scale arrays","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p271christopoulos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065412S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227042","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227044,"authors":[{"name":"Emilio Antonio-Rodr\u00edguez","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland","Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Emilio","lastName":"Antonio-Rodr\u00edguez","id":"38468483900"},{"name":"Roberto L\u00f3pez-Valcarce","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-Valcarce","id":"38275836800"},{"name":"Taneli Riihonen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Taneli","lastName":"Riihonen","id":"37392216400"},{"name":"Stefan Werner","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Werner","id":"37085427736"},{"name":"Risto Wichman","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University, Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Risto","lastName":"Wichman","id":"37360646900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227044","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Dynamic range","Optimization","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codecs","filters","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SINR optimization","MIMO full-duplex relays","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","receiver","transmitter","transmit filters","receive filters","decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["full-duplex","MIMO","regenerative relay","self-interference","cancellation","suppression"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method for maximizing the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in a wideband full-duplex MIMO regenerative relay that accounts limited dynamic range of the receiver and transmitter impairments.

Essential self-interference signal models under different RF imperfections are first presented, and then used to formulate widely linear, nonlinear and augmented nonlinear digital canceler structures. Furthermore, a general parameter estimation procedure based on least squares is laid out. Digital cancellation with actual measured self-interference signals is then performed using all the presented methods. To ensure a realistic scenario, the used transmitter has realistic levels of I/Q imbalance, and is also utilizing a highly nonlinear low-cost power amplifier. Furthermore, a realistic RF canceler is incorporated in the measurements, and both shared-antenna and dual-antenna based devices are measured and experimented. The obtained results indicate that only a digital canceler structure capable of modeling all the essential impairments is able to suppress the self-interference close to the receiver noise floor.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Radio frequency","Receivers","Transceivers","Antennas","Wireless communication","Nonlinear distortion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","least squares approximations","nonlinear distortion","parameter estimation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital self-interference cancellation","nonideal RF component","full-duplex radio","self-interference signal model","RF imperfection","augmented nonlinear digital canceler structure","parameter estimation procedure","least square procedure","I/Q imbalance","nonlinear low-cost power amplifier","RF canceler","shared-antenna device","dual-antenna device","self-interference supression","receiver noise floor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Full-duplex","self-interference","I/Q imbalance","nonlinear distortion","digital cancellation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227045","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227045.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227045","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital self-interference cancellation under nonideal RF components: Advanced algorithms and measured performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227045","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digital self-interference cancellation under nonideal RF components: Advanced algorithms and measured performance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227045/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227045/","accessionNumber":"15417007","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital self-interference cancellation under nonideal RF components: Advanced algorithms and measured performance","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p286korpi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056889S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7227047,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammadali Mohammadi","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Shahrekord University, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammadali","lastName":"Mohammadi","id":"37584720900"},{"name":"Himal A.

The full-duplex operation allows leveraging channel reciprocity for open-loop uplink training to estimate the downlink channels. However, the uplink transmission of training creates interference at the downlink receiving mobile nodes. We characterize the optimal training resource allocation and its associated spectral efficiency, in the proposed open-loop training based full-duplex system. We also evaluate the performance of the half-duplex counterpart to derive the relative gains of full-duplex training. Despite the existence of the inter-node interference due to full-duplex, significant spectral efficiency improvement is attained over half-duplex operation.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227048","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227048.pdf","startPage":"301","endPage":"305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227048","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MU-MIMO beamforming with full-duplex open-loop training","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227048","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227048/","displayDocTitle":"MU-MIMO beamforming with full-duplex open-loop training","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417055","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227048/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MU-MIMO beamforming with full-duplex open-loop training","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p301du.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058628S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227049,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o S.

The performance of such system can be greatly increased when the relay station is equipped with a large number of antennas on both transmitter and receiver sides. In this paper, we exploit the use of massive arrays to effectively suppress the loopback interference (LI) of a decode-and-forward relay (DF) and evaluate the performance of the end-to-end (e2e) transmission. This paper assumes imperfect channel state information is available at the relay and designs a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) filter to mitigate the interference. Subsequently, we adopt zero-forcing (ZF) filters for both detection and beamforming. The performance of such system is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER) at both relay and destinations, and an optimal choice for the transmission power at the relay is shown. We then propose a complexity efficient optimal power allocation (OPA) algorithm that, using the channel statistics, computes the minimum power that satisfies the rate constraints of each pair. The results obtained via simulation show that when both MMSE filtering and OPA method are used, better values for the energy efficiency are attained.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227049","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227049.pdf","startPage":"306","endPage":"310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Massive MIMO full-duplex relaying with optimal power allocation for independent multipairs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227049","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227049/","displayDocTitle":"Massive MIMO full-duplex relaying with optimal power allocation for independent multipairs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417058","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227049/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Massive MIMO full-duplex relaying with optimal power allocation for independent multipairs","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p306monteiro.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056131S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227049","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227050,"authors":[{"name":"David Gregoratti","affiliation":["Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gregoratti","id":"37403260200"},{"name":"Xavier Mestre","affiliation":["Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnologia, Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Xavier","lastName":"Mestre","id":"37284392300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227050","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion","Prototypes","Receivers","OFDM","Synchronization","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion analysis","OQAM based OFDMA","FBMC based OFDMA","strong frequency selectivity","timing synchronization errors","imperfect equalization"]}],"abstract":"The paper considers an OFDMA scheme based on OQAM/FBMC and evaluates the interaction of the different users to one another under strong frequency selectivity or timing synchronization errors between users.

Instead of estimating the channel for each receiver independently and ignoring the angles of arrival of each of the channel paths, the suggested technique is based on spatially filtering each of the channel paths by steering a multi-frequency beamformer to their angles of arrival. As the number of channel paths is usually smaller than the number of the receivers, this process reduces the dimensionality of the model and involves a lower computational load. The signals at the output of the beamformer are then decoded in a coherent or differentially-coherent form.

This technique allows us to solve the well known pairing issue between the DOA and carrier frequency to be recovered for each transmission.

Simulations show that our algorithm outperforms a distributed collaborative scheme based on the One-Step Greedy Algorithm (OSGA) using randomized gossip, and that its performance converges to that of its centralized version.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227055","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227055.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227055","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","startPage":"336","endPage":"340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed cooperative spectrum sensing from sub-Nyquist samples for Cognitive Radios","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Distributed cooperative spectrum sensing from sub-Nyquist samples for Cognitive Radios","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227055/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227055/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417047","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed cooperative spectrum sensing from sub-Nyquist samples for Cognitive Radios","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p336cohen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074148S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227057,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Banelli","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Banelli","id":"37271755900"},{"name":"Luca Rugini","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Rugini","id":"37271756800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227057","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","OFDM","Wireless communication","Bayes methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","impulse noise","mean square error methods","OFDM modulation","radiocommunication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["impulsive noise mitigation","wireless OFDM","man-made disturbance","electrical device","wireless communication systems","Bayesian estimators","Gaussian sources","Middleton Class-A noise","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","minimum mean-squared error","maximum signal-to-noise-ratio estimators","OFDM systems","frequency-selective fading channels","symbol-error rate performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blanker","Class-A noise","impulsive noise","MMSE estimation","soft limiter"]}],"abstract":"Impulsive noise typically represents a man-made disturbance that, although it may impair any electrical device, is often neglected in the performance analysis of wireless communication systems.

The multitaper detector has been strongly recommended to be used for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio systems. In this paper we provide a new and accurate model for the Multitaper detector assuming that both the transmitting and detecting nodes are employing single-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) structures. We present closed form mathematical expressions for the performance of the decision variable within the hypotheses testing context. We model the decision variable using the Phase-Type distribution, where we derive the exact distribution parameters for both the null and the alternate hypotheses. Furthermore, we accurately bound the average probability of detection over Nakagami fading channels. Finally, the average probability of detection is maximized to yield a predetermined probability of false alarm. The results show that the obtained analytical models are accurate. As a generic trend, it is found that adjusting the length of observed sequences has no effect on the detector performance. On the other hand, it is found that increasing the number of receiving branches provides a significant enhancement for the MIMO-Multitaper method.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227058","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227058.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","startPage":"351","endPage":"355","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-based Multitaper detection over Nakagami channels for dynamic spectrum access devices","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-based Multitaper detection over Nakagami channels for dynamic spectrum access devices","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227058/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417010","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7227058/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-based Multitaper detection over Nakagami channels for dynamic spectrum access devices","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p351yousif.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064173S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227058","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227061,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed S.

We consider two classes of Gaussian channels: the Gaussian single-input single-output (SISO) multi-receiver wiretap channel and the degraded Gaussian multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multi-receiver wiretap channel. These two channels belong to the class of degraded multi-receiver wiretap channels. In previous literature the secrecy capacity regions of these two channels were established under the conservative joint secrecy constraint. Thus, we focus our work on the less conservative individual secrecy constraint, which is characterized by a higher throughput. We establish the individual secrecy capacity region for these two cases. The achievability follows from the individual secrecy capacity established for the discrete memoryless degraded wiretap channels where coding is performed using Gaussian signals. On the other hand, the converse is established by adapting the techniques used for formulating the joint secrecy capacity region to the individual secrecy constraint.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227061","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227061.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227061","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The individual secrecy capacity of the Gaussian SISO and degraded Gaussian MIMO multi-receiver wiretap channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227061/","displayDocTitle":"The individual secrecy capacity of the Gaussian SISO and degraded Gaussian MIMO multi-receiver wiretap channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15416962","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227061/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The individual secrecy capacity of the Gaussian SISO and degraded Gaussian MIMO multi-receiver wiretap channel","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p365mansour.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05177S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227064,"authors":[{"name":"Alessio Zappone","affiliation":["Communications Laboratory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Alessio","lastName":"Zappone","id":"37399768400"},{"name":"Pin-Hsun Lin","affiliation":["Communications Laboratory, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Pin-Hsun","lastName":"Lin","id":"37278544700"},{"name":"Eduard A.

In this paper, we first analyze the mean packet delay in radio access and backhaul networks via modeling the HCN using spatial point process. With the proposed model, we formulate a BS association optimization problem based on cell range expansion so as to minimize the mean network packet delay. Adopting an intuitive solution for the spectrum allocation, the optimal association policy is obtained, which can be directly translated to optimal bias factor configurations. Numerical results are presented to compare the proposed and traditional association policies, which show the significant effect of backhaul on network performance and demonstrate the urgency of a joint system design approach for radio access and backhaul networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227066/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15417028","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227066/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Backhaul-aware base station association in two-tier heterogeneous cellular networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Backhaul-aware base station association in two-tier heterogeneous cellular networks","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p390zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067613S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7227067,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Ghauch","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Ghauch","id":"38232772300"},{"name":"Mats Bengtsson","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Bengtsson","id":"37085469845"},{"name":"Taejoon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Taejoon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37578853600"},{"name":"Mikael Skoglund","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)"],"firstName":"Mikael","lastName":"Skoglund","id":"37085336248"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227067","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":545},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Channel estimation","Transmitters","Receivers","Radio frequency","Estimation","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","channel estimation","iterative methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subspace estimation","subspace decomposition","hybrid analog-digital millimetre-wave MIMO systems","channel estimation","channel precoding","channel reciprocity","TDD MIMO systems","Krylov subspace methods","iterative method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Millimeter wave MIMO systems","sparse channel estimation","hybrid architecture","analog-digital precoding","subspace decomposition","Arnoldi iteration","subspace estimation"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we address the problem of channel estimation and precoding / combining for the so-called hybrid millimeter wave (mmWave) MIMO architecture. Our proposed channel estimation scheme exploits channel reciprocity in TDD MIMO systems, by using echoing, thereby allowing us to implement Krylov subspace methods in a fully distributed way. The latter results in estimating the right (resp. left) singular subspace of the channel at the transmitter (resp. receiver). Moreover, we also tackle the problem of subspace decomposition whereby the estimated right (resp. left) singular subspaces are approximated by a cascade of analog and digital precoder (resp. combiner), using an iterative method. Finally we compare our scheme with an equivalent fully digital case and conclude that a relatively similar performance can be achieved, however, with a drastically reduced number of RF chains - 4 ~ 8 times less (i.e., massive savings in cost and power consumption).","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227067","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227067.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227067","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subspace estimation and decomposition for hybrid analog-digital millimetre-wave MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227067","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227067/","displayDocTitle":"Subspace estimation and decomposition for hybrid analog-digital millimetre-wave MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417029","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227067/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subspace estimation and decomposition for hybrid analog-digital millimetre-wave MIMO systems","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p395ghauch.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05332S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227069,"authors":[{"name":"Yuriy Zakharov","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of York, UK"],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Zakharov","id":"37085384693"},{"name":"Zheng Delai","affiliation":["Wireless Network Research Department, Huawei Technologies Co.

We further show that the problem in each iteration can also be approximated as a second-order cone program (SOCP), allowing for exploiting computationally efficient state-of-the-art SOCP solvers.

However, time varying phase uncertainties imposed by the components and the channel, combined with delayed feedback perturbs the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). In this paper, we consider a power constrained robust formulation of the downlink precoding problem to counter the phase uncertainties. In particular it considers imposing conditions on the average signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), to deal with imperfect CSIT. In addition to the robust formulation, the primacy of user selection is highlighted and a new approach exploiting the satellite system design is proposed. Performance of the derived robust precoder in conjunction with the proposed location based user selection is then evaluated and the gains are tabulated.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227072","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227072.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","startPage":"420","endPage":"424","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding design and user selection for multibeam satellite channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precoding design and user selection for multibeam satellite channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227072/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15416970","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7227072/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding design and user selection for multibeam satellite channels","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p420gharanjik.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075761S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227073,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Ramezani-Kebrya","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Ramezani-Kebrya","id":"37075313600"},{"name":"Min Dong","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering, Institute of Technology, Canada"],"lastName":"Min Dong","id":"37402785200"},{"name":"Ben Liang","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Canada"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Liang","id":"37085362333"},{"name":"Gary Boudreau","affiliation":["Ericsson Canada, Canada"],"firstName":"Gary","lastName":"Boudreau","id":"38364857200"},{"name":"S.

We propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the sum rate in two steps. We first consider the D2D admissibility problem to determine whether the D2D pair can share the spectrum with the CU while satisfying all the constraints and SINR requirements. We then obtain the optimal beam vector and the optimal power levels of the CU and D2D transmitters in closed form. The performance of the proposed algorithm is studied numerically. It is shown the proposed optimal solution substantially outperforms a CU-priority heuristic approach that selects the maximum CU power with minimum D2D interference.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227073","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227073.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227073","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","startPage":"425","endPage":"429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation in device-to-device communication with SIMO uplink beamforming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation in device-to-device communication with SIMO uplink beamforming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227073/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227073/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15416971","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation in device-to-device communication with SIMO uplink beamforming","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p425ramezanikebrya.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085927S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227073","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7227074,"authors":[{"name":"Rami Mochaourab","affiliation":["Signal Processing Department, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Mochaourab","id":"37540455300"},{"name":"Mats Bengtsson","affiliation":["Signal Processing Department, KTH Royal Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Mats","lastName":"Bengtsson","id":"37266300700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227074","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":126},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization","Signal processing algorithms","Yttrium","MIMO","Receivers","Covariance matrices","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","broadcast channels","MIMO communication","optimisation","receiving antennas","transceivers","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear transceiver optimization","multicell MIMO","generalized Benders decomposition","maximum sum rate optimization problem","multiple-input multiple-output interfering broadcast channel","multiple-antenna transmitter","multiple-antenna receiver","channel state information","NP-hard problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["interfering broadcast channel","multiple-input single-output","sum rate optimization","linear transceiver design","generalized Benders decomposition"]}],"abstract":"We study the maximum sum rate optimization problem in the multiple-input multiple-output interfering broadcast channel.

While one approach is guaranteed to converge to a local optimum of the original problem, the other approach hinges on techniques which can be promising for devising a global optimization method.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227074","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227074.pdf","startPage":"430","endPage":"434","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear transceiver optimization in multicell MIMO based on the generalized benders decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227074/","displayDocTitle":"Linear transceiver optimization in multicell MIMO based on the generalized benders decomposition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417030","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227074/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear transceiver optimization in multicell MIMO based on the generalized benders decomposition","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p430mochaourab.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053956S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227074","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227075,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaxian Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"lastName":"Jiaxian Pan","id":"37713574400"},{"name":"Wing-Kin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"lastName":"Wing-Kin Ma","id":"37274385900"},{"name":"Xin Xia","affiliation":["Wireless Network Research Dept II, Chengdu, China","Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd."],"lastName":"Xin Xia","id":"37085617364"},{"name":"Yuan Tian","affiliation":["Wireless Network Research Dept II, Chengdu, China","Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd."],"lastName":"Yuan Tian","id":"37085631057"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227075","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1325},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","interference suppression","least mean squares methods","Long Term Evolution","MIMO communication","optimisation","radio receivers","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WMMSE-based multiuser MIMO beamforming","LTE system performance evaluation","multiuser MIMO downlink beamforming scenario","weighted minimum mean square error approach","sum rate maximization","linear receivers","successive interference cancellation receivers","imperfect channel knowledge","long term evolution","modified WMMSE algorithm","time division duplexing LTE simulation platform","system throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WMMSE","sum rate maximization","linear receivers","imperfect CSIT","LTE"]}],"abstract":"This paper deals with the multiuser MIMO downlink beamforming scenario. In this scenario, a popular approach for designing the beamformer is the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) approach for sum rate maximization. This work considers the WMMSE method from an implementation perspective, where we take into account practical factors - such as linear receivers (rather than successive interference cancellation receivers, which are implicitly assumed in some existing works but are more complex to implement) and imperfect channel knowledge at the transmitter - for deployment in systems such as long term evolution (LTE). A modified WMMSE algorithm that incorporates such factors is proposed. We evaluate the performance of the proposed WMMSE algorithm using a time division duplexing (TDD) LTE simulation platform, and show that our practice-oriented design can improve the system throughput by 3 ~ 30% in comparison with the conventional WMMSE algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"WMMSE-based multiuser MIMO beamforming: A practice-oriented design and LTE system performance evaluation","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227075","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227075.pdf","startPage":"435","endPage":"439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227075","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"WMMSE-based multiuser MIMO beamforming: A practice-oriented design and LTE system performance evaluation","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227075/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417051","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"WMMSE-based multiuser MIMO beamforming: A practice-oriented design and LTE system performance evaluation","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p435pan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07785S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227076,"authors":[{"name":"Joseph M.

This technique is known as digital backpropagation. Typical digital backpropagation algorithms are based on split-step Fourier methods in which the signal has to be discretized in time and space. The need to discretize in both time and space however makes the real-time implementation of digital backpropagation a challenging problem. In this paper, a new fast algorithm for digital backpropagation based on nonlinear Fourier transforms is presented. Aiming at a proof of concept, the main emphasis will be put on fibers with normal dispersion in order to avoid the issue of solitonic components in the signal. However, it is demonstrated that the algorithm also works for anomalous dispersion if the signal power is low enough. Since the spatial evolution of a signal governed by the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be reverted analytically in the nonlinear Fourier domain through simple phase-shifts, there is no need to discretize the spatial domain. The proposed algorithm requires only O(D log\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n D) floating point operations to backpropagate a signal given by D samples, independently of the fiber's length, and is therefore highly promising for real-time implementations. The merits of this new approach are illustrated through numerical simulations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227077.pdf","startPage":"445","endPage":"449","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital backpropagation in the nonlinear Fourier domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Q-factor","Phase shift keying","OFDM","Solitons","Bit error rate","Integrated optics","Nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","Fourier transforms","nonlinear equations","numerical analysis","optical fibre networks","Schrodinger equation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear Fourier domain","dispersive transmission impairments","fiber-optic communication systems","nonlinear Schrodinger equation","digital backpropagation algorithms","split-step Fourier methods","nonlinear Fourier transforms","solitonic components","signal power","phase-shifts","spatial domain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical Fiber","Digital Backpropagation","Nonlinear Fourier Transform","Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger Equation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Digital backpropagation in the nonlinear Fourier domain","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227077/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417035","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital backpropagation in the nonlinear Fourier domain","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p445wahls.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063997S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7227079,"authors":[{"name":"Qun Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Mawson Lakes, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Qun","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086840581"},{"name":"Terence H.

This is performed by considering certain informative prior distributions for the channel coefficients. Assuming a sparse multipath channel, the equalisation problem is formulated in a Bayesian setting and inference is performed in the well-known framework better known as Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). The previously proposed Fast Variational SBL (FVSBL) algorithm is capable of efficient inference in a true Bayesian setting but only in the case of uninformative prior distributions.

Therefore, it is very important to achieve a high precision time and frequency synchronization. With the absence of pilot symbols, blind synchronization algorithms using different metric functions or statistics of the received signal can be used. In this paper, a new blind symbol timing and frequency offset estimation algorithm is proposed for OFDM systems in multipath fading channels. The method utilizes the redundant information contained in the cyclic prefix and does not necessitate any channel profile knowledge. In contrary to other works that propose a timing function, the proposed method extracts the timing offset and the channel length directly from the correlation characteristics between the received samples. Consequently, an interference-free region is specified and the frequency offset is jointly estimated. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations over Rayleigh multipath fading channels of different delay spreads. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms considerably other algorithms in related work and is robust to varying channel conditions.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227084","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227084.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","startPage":"480","endPage":"484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A blind timing and frequency synchronization method based on the correlation characteristics of an OFDM signal","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A blind timing and frequency synchronization method based on the correlation characteristics of an OFDM signal","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227084/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417075","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7227084/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A blind timing and frequency synchronization method based on the correlation characteristics of an OFDM signal","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p480elhajjshehadeh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075499S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227089,"authors":[{"name":"Xin He","affiliation":["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan","Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"He","id":"37070094300"},{"name":"Xiaobo Zhou","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Xiaobo","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38240372600"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"},{"name":"Tad Matsumoto","affiliation":["Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST), Nomi, Ishikawa, Japan","Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Tad","lastName":"Matsumoto","id":"37277382600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227089","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data and error rate bounds for binary data gathering wireless sensor networks","abstract":"The goal of this paper is to provide analytical assessment that justifies the performance tendencies of practical encoding/decoding techniques for a binary data gathering wireless sensor network (WSN).

We present an Analysis-by-Synthesis (AbS) quantization scheme in which, as a novelty, Bayesian-optimal Approximate Message Passing (BAMP) is used as a reconstruction algorithm. The focus is on source signals that can be modeled by a linear combination of a discrete component and a zero-mean Gaussian component; for those signals suitable estimation functions are given for use in the BAMP algorithm.

Exploiting OBP can lead to efficient implementation, bandwidth saving, lower redundancy, and better performance. Enabling processing aboard a satellite necessitates re-assessing the implementation of a number of signal processing techniques which, so far, have been ground-centric. In this work, we investigate the possibility of implementing signal predistortion (SPD) aboard a satellite having digital transparent processor (DTP). Such satellites employ transponders that allow for the implementation of limited functionalities in the digital domain. On-board predistortion can then be performed on the digitized data and can provide better performance compared to on-ground techniques. However, the conversion to the digital domain performed by an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) introduces different types of noise. Among these, the clock jitter requires the implementation of estimation and compensation algorithms. In this paper we propose a reduced-complexity on-board signal predistortion algorithm capable of post-compensating the jitter introduced by the ADC, and pre-compensating the distortion generated by the amplifier.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227095","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227095.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","startPage":"535","endPage":"539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-board signal predistortion for digital transparent satellites","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227095","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On-board signal predistortion for digital transparent satellites","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227095/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417040","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7227095/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-board signal predistortion for digital transparent satellites","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p535mazzali.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05742S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":7227096,"authors":[{"name":"Praneeth Jayasinghe","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Praneeth","lastName":"Jayasinghe","id":"37085408095"},{"name":"Antti T\u00f6lli","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"T\u00f6lli","id":"37284723300"},{"name":"Matti Latva-aho","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Matti","lastName":"Latva-aho","id":"37270610400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227096","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":245},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Bidirectional control","Bismuth","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Convergence","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","cellular radio","iterative methods","mean square error methods","optimisation","telecommunication signalling","telecommunication traffic","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bidirectional signaling strategies","dynamic time division duplexing system","dynamic TDD networks","decentralized beamformer design","small-cell network","multiantenna base stations","user terminals","instantaneous traffic demand","power constraints","weighted sum mean-squared error","MSE minimization framework","decentralized iterative solution","iterative algorithms","bidirectional signaling schemes","channel information","signaling overhead"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates several bi-directional signaling strategies to facilitate decentralized beamformer design in a dynamic time division duplexing (TDD) system. A small-cell network with multi-antenna base stations and user terminals is considered, where the cells are operating either in uplink or downlink mode depending on the instantaneous traffic demand. Decentralized beamformer design is proposed to maximize the weighted sum rate of the network subjected to individual power constraints at BSs and user terminals. The weighted sum mean-squared error (MSE) minimization framework is used to decouple the optimization problem across the nodes, which enables decentralized iterative solution. Iterative algorithms are proposed with the different bi-directional signaling schemes embedded into the TDD frame structure. A detailed signaling flow of exchanging beamformer and channel information is described for each bi-directional signaling strategy. The proposed strategies are compared with the uncoordinated system while taking into account the signaling overhead.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227096","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227096.pdf","startPage":"540","endPage":"544","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227096","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bi-directional signaling strategies for dynamic TDD networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227096","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227096/","displayDocTitle":"Bi-directional signaling strategies for dynamic TDD networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15416979","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227096/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-directional signaling strategies for dynamic TDD networks","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p540jayasinghe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053256S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227097,"authors":[{"name":"Sissi Xiaoxiao Wu","affiliation":["Department of System Engineering & Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Sissi Xiaoxiao","lastName":"Wu","id":"37716877500"},{"name":"Qiang Li","affiliation":["School of Communication & Information Engineering, University of Electronic Science & Technology of China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37291114800"},{"name":"Wing-Kin Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Wing-Kin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37274385900"},{"name":"Anthony Man-Cho So","affiliation":["Department of System Engineering & Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Anthony Man-Cho","lastName":"So","id":"37410192000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227097","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences","Signal processing","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","mathematical programming","minimax techniques","multicast communication","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic amplify-and-forward schemes","multigroup multicast transmission","distributed relay network","two-hop distributed one-way relay network","channel state information","rank-one beamformed AF","max-min-fair","semidefinite relaxation technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["one-way relay","stochastic beamforming","amplify-and-forward (AF)","multigroup multicast","SDR"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study amplify-and-forward (AF) schemes to for multigroup multicast information delivery between long-distance users. The target scenario is a two-hop distributed one-way relay network where the transmitters, relays and receivers are all equipped with a single antenna. Assuming that channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known, our goal here is to design the AF weights at the relays so that the system rate performance can be optimized. A classic AF scheme in this context is to employ a rank-one beamformed AF (BF-AF) strategy with a max-min-fair (MMF) achievable rate objective. In this way, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique is widely used to provide an (approximate) solution for the MMF problem. It is known that the achievable rate performance of the SDR-based BF-AF scheme tends to degrade seriously with the number of users served in the relay network. This motivates us to propose stochastic beamformed AF (SBF-AF) schemes to improve the achievable rate performance. The salient feature of the SBF-AF schemes is that it employs time-varying AF weights and bypass some inherent issues in the SDR-based BF-AF scheme. Our theoretical analysis and numerical results both show that the SBF-AF schemes can outperform the BF-AF scheme.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227097","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227097.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227097","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","startPage":"545","endPage":"549","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic amplify-and-forward schemes for multigroup multicast transmission in a distributed relay network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic amplify-and-forward schemes for multigroup multicast transmission in a distributed relay network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227097/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227097/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417087","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic amplify-and-forward schemes for multigroup multicast transmission in a distributed relay network","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p545wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061126S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227098,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Han","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Han","id":"37085484635"},{"name":"An Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"An","lastName":"Liu","id":"37402452900"},{"name":"Vincent K.

Multi-way relay networks (MWRNs) can address this challenge by improving the system spectral efficiency. In this work, we further improve the spectral efficiency of MWRNs by proposing a novel linear beamforming design, namely partial zero-forcing (PZF), for MWRNs with a multiple-input-multiple-output relay. Compared to zero-forcing (ZF), in PZF, the constraints on the relay beamforming are relaxed such that only partial user-interference, instead of all, is canceled at the relay. After receiving the relay's signal, the users eliminate the remaining interferences through self-interference and successive interference cancellation. By taking such two-stage interference cancellation, PZF better exploits the degrees-of-freedom in MWRNs and achieves higher data rates than ZF.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227101/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15416975","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227101/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Partial zero forcing for multi-way relay networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial zero forcing for multi-way relay networks","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p565zhang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053934S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227101","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227103,"authors":[{"name":"Christos Masouros","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical & Electronic Eng., University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Masouros","id":"37299872300"},{"name":"Tharm Ratnarajah","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Tharm","lastName":"Ratnarajah","id":"37284633900"},{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["School of Eng. and Physical Sciences, Herriot Watt University, Edinburgh, UK"],"firstName":"Mathini","lastName":"Sellathurai","id":"37285072400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227103","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational complexity","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","optimisation","precoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable performance-complexity tradeoff","vector precoding","partial perturbation optimization","VP","multiuser multiple input multiple output system","MU-MIMO system","complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vector perturbation","power efficiency","complexity reduction","multi-user MIMO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227103","abstract":"We explore a performance-complexity tradeoff for vector precoding (VP) for the downlink of multi-user multiple input multiple output (MU-MIMO) systems.

The proposed methods are inspired by potential field techniques applied in robot navigation. The novelty of the proposed methods arises from identifying the analogy between packet routing in wireless networks and obstacle avoidance in robot navigation. This allows for the modeling of desired communication destinations as attractive forces and sources of interference as repulsive forces, that guide the packet towards the destination while avoiding interference. The packets are routed along the potential induced by these forces towards the destination. In this paper we focus on minimizing the route delay, but other routing metrics such as energy could be used as well. It is shown that the proposed delay aware potential field based routing method can significantly reduce the average route delay while ensuring that the interference induced remains in tolerable levels. Furthermore, it is shown via simulations that a suboptimal but computationally simpler one-iteration version of the optimal potential field can achieve delay performance that is close to optimum. The simulation results also illustrate that by knowing (or by spending some resources in finding out) the PU receiver location can significantly reduce the average delay.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227113/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15417041","publicationDate":"June 2015","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7227113/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing the routing delay in cognitive radios using potential fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing the routing delay in cognitive radios using potential fields","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p625oksanen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068328S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227115,"authors":[{"name":"Huiqin Du","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Huiqin","lastName":"Du","id":"37708277700"},{"name":"Tharm Ratnarajah","affiliation":["IDCoM, University of Edinburgh, U.K."],"firstName":"Tharm","lastName":"Ratnarajah","id":"37065840000"},{"name":"Mathini Sellathurai","affiliation":["School of Engineering & Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, U.K."],"firstName":"Mathini","lastName":"Sellathurai","id":"37285072400"},{"name":"Jonathon Chambers","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Newcastle University, U.K."],"firstName":"Jonathon","lastName":"Chambers","id":"37273618700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227115","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"abstract":"This paper considers a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular interference channel.

In particular, total average transmission rate is derived as a function of various system parameters such as backhaul link capacity, cache size, number of active transmitter-receiver pairs as well as the quantization bits for channel state information (CSI). Given the fact that base stations are equipped both with caching and IA capabilities and have knowledge of content popularity profile, we then characterize an operational regime where the caching is beneficial. Subsequently, we find the optimal number of transmitter-receiver pairs that maximizes the total average transmission rate. When the popularity profile of requested contents falls into the operational regime, it turns out that caching substantially improves the throughput as it mitigates the backhaul usage and allows IA methods to take benefit of such limited backhaul.","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227119","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227119.pdf","startPage":"655","endPage":"659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the benefits of edge caching for MIMO interference alignment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227119/","displayDocTitle":"On the benefits of edge caching for MIMO interference alignment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15417088","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the benefits of edge caching for MIMO interference alignment","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p655deghel.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021163S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"31","articleId":"7227119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7227126,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Ivanov","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Ivanov","id":"38666263400"},{"name":"Petar Popovski","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Petar","lastName":"Popovski","id":"37281987200"},{"name":"Fredrik Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Fredrik","lastName":"Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m","id":"37283169100"},{"name":"Alexandre Graell i Amat","affiliation":["Department of Signals and Systems, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Graell i Amat","id":"37279070400"},{"name":"\u010cedomir Stefanovi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"\u010cedomir","lastName":"Stefanovi\u0107","id":"37567275100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1931-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1930-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-3244"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-3252"}],"articleNumber":"7227126","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Conferences","Receivers","Signal processing algorithms","Signal processing","Wireless communication","Probabilistic logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","codes","intelligent transportation systems","mobile communication","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["all-to-all broadcast coded slotted ALOHA","probabilistic handshake mechanism"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7227126","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209174/7226983/07227126.pdf","startPage":"690","endPage":"694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227126","doi":"10.1109/SPAWC.2015.7227126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7226983","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 16th International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications (SPAWC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic handshake in all-to-all broadcast coded slotted ALOHA","abstract":"We propose a probabilistic handshake mechanism for all-to-all broadcast coded slotted ALOHA.

The problem consists of finding the minimum rate (or load) to deliver all users' requested messages from the sources and/or caches in the network. In particular, the capacity of two network models, shared link caching networks and device-to-device caching networks, is relatively well understood. To advance the understanding of the capacity of more general caching networks, in this paper, we study a class of networks of increasing practical interest, namely, the combination caching networks. These networks are formed by a single source connected to n = (\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</sub>\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sup>\n) user nodes through a layer of k relay nodes, such that each user node is connected to a unique subset of r relay nodes, and caching takes place at the user nodes only. In this setting, particularly useful to model heterogeneous wireless and wireline networks, we show that, in most parameter regimes, by using a concatenated coded multicasting - combination network coding (CM-CNC) scheme, the achievable maximum link load is inversely proportional to the per-user storage capacity M and to the degree of each user r. In addition, we provide an information theoretic converse and show that the gap between achievability and converse bounds is within a logarithmic factor of the system parameters in most regimes of practical interest.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7227127/","conferenceDate":"28 June-1 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15417005","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7227127/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"On the fundamental limits of caching in combination networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the fundamental limits of caching in combination networks","confLoc":"Stockholm, Sweden","sourcePdf":"p695ji.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083213S","chronDate":"June 28 2015-July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209174","isNumber":"7226983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209174","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7226983","articleId":"7227127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7228068,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Authors have proposed a practical application of Massive MIMO, that is, Massive Antenna System for Wireless Entrance links (MAS-WE), and the performance of the proposed systems have been verified by computer simulations and a propagation experiment. Assuming line of sight (LOS) environment, which provides stable transmission paths, MAS-WE can avoid the two key problems of Massive MIMO. However, the conventional antenna arrangement; e.g. square or circular array degrades the system capacity of MAS-WE due to the mutual coupling of antenna elements or channel spatial correlation; the difficulty is the inter-element spacing of antennas. In this paper, we propose a new antenna arrangement that reduces channel spatial correlation directly without additional mutual coupling. Simulation results show that the proposed arrangement can reduce channel spatial correlation at CDF=50% value by 80% compared to the circular array and 75% compared to the square array.","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228208.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new antenna arrangement design of Massive MIMO in LOS environment for further capacity enhancement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228208","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228208/","displayDocTitle":"A new antenna arrangement design of Massive MIMO in LOS environment for further capacity enhancement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416796","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7228208/","conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new antenna arrangement design of Massive MIMO in LOS environment for further capacity enhancement","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570040237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056278S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228208","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228225,"authors":[{"name":"Wiem Dahech","affiliation":["Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Universit\u00e9 de Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Wiem","lastName":"Dahech","id":"37085730751"},{"name":"Matthias P\u00e4tzold","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Science, University of Agder, Grimstad, Norway"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"P\u00e4tzold","id":"37085743123"},{"name":"N\u00e9ji Youssef","affiliation":["Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications de Tunis, Universit\u00e9 de Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"N\u00e9ji","lastName":"Youssef","id":"37356418900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0185-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0182-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"7228225","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Transmitters","Receivers","Manganese","Mobile communication","Channel models","Scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","fading channels","mobile radio","multipath channels","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile-to-mobile communication systems","M2M communication systems","transmitter mobile stations","receiver mobile stations","realistic propagation scenarios","mobile velocity","nonstationary M2M multipath fading channel model","local autocorrelation function","ACF","local power spectral density","PSD","correlation properties","M2M fading channel"]}],"abstract":"In mobile-to-mobile (M2M) communication systems, both the transmitter and the receiver mobile stations are moving with a certain velocity which is usually assumed to be constant over time. However, in realistic propagation scenarios, the mobile velocity changes continuously resulting in a non-stationary fading process. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of a non-stationary M2M multipath fading channel model, where the transmitter and the receiver may experience changes in their velocities. For the proposed model, we derive expressions for the local autocorrelation function (ACF) and the local power spectral density (PSD). By relaxing the assumption of constant velocity, our study shows that the correlation properties of the M2M fading channel are significantly affected.","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228225.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A non-stationary mobile-to-mobile multipath fading channel model taking account of velocity variations of the mobile stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228225","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A non-stationary mobile-to-mobile multipath fading channel model taking account of velocity variations of the mobile stations","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228225/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416605","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7228225/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A non-stationary mobile-to-mobile multipath fading channel model taking account of velocity variations of the mobile stations","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570041933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046204S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228236,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Moreno","affiliation":["Engineering Department, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Juan","lastName":"Moreno","id":"37085592281"},{"name":"Leandro de Haro","affiliation":["ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"de Haro","id":"37279762800"},{"name":"Carlos Rodr\u00edguez","affiliation":["Engineering Department, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Rodr\u00edguez","id":"37085593703"},{"name":"Luis Cu\u00e9llar","affiliation":["ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Cu\u00e9llar","id":"37318838600"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel Riera","affiliation":["ETSI Telecomunicaci\u00f3n, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"Jos\u00e9 Manuel","lastName":"Riera","id":"37299693800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0185-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0182-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"7228236","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna measurements","Arrays","Resource management","Antenna arrays","Rail transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","diversity reception","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","railway communication","tunnels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO train-to-wayside communication system","train-to-wayside radio","subway tunnels","MIMO-OFDM","polarization diversity","antenna separation","tunnel cross-section","MIMO capacity","power allocation","waterfilling algorithm","Metro de Madrid","Spain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["diversity","MIMO","underground","vehicle-to-infrastructure propagation"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a deep insight on a real implementation of a train-to-wayside radio on subway tunnels that makes use of a 2\u00d72 MIMO-OFDM setup.

Cognitive radio concept aims at using the frequency bands more efficiently. A main concern in recent research is to maximize the throughput of the secondary cognitive radio network under the restriction of avoiding interference to the primary network. Traditionally, a specific interval is conceived to the task of spectrum sensing, which penalizes the secondary network throughput. Nowadays, the continuous sensing mode has been extensively studied. In this approach, secondary receiving nodes continuously sense the spectrum while other secondary users simultaneously transmit in the same frequency band. We compare, under the continuous sensing approach, the performances of centralized spatiotemporally cooperative spectrum sensing techniques. The altered versions of well-established generalized likelihood ratio test and maximum-minimum eigenvalue detection techniques are considered. We consider the sample fusion, the decision fusion and the eigenvalue fusion technique. It is shown that, in spite of the intrinsic interference present in the continuous mode, this approach is flexible in terms of the sensing time, allowing better sensing performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228292.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous sensing-transmission in cognitive radio networks under spatiotemporally collaborative techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7228292/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous sensing-transmission in cognitive radio networks under spatiotemporally collaborative techniques","conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416805","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous sensing-transmission in cognitive radio networks under spatiotemporally collaborative techniques","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570044269.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059554S","chronDate":"13-17 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228297,"authors":[{"name":"T.

This is used to simulate the radiation characteristic of a roof antenna system on a vehicle roof. The radiated fields of the antenna are first simulated for example with CST Microwave Studio (MWS) or measured and then utilized in the ray tracer. Besides to the modeling of the roof itself, also the antenna patterns are investigated. Small distances between the antenna and the vehicle roof do not allow to work with far-field assumptions. In this case, antennas with reduced extents are used, called subtransmitters [1]. These subtransmitters are represented by surface currents obtained from simulations with CST MWS. With this concept, also an antenna on the roof can be simulated with a ray tracing approach. Finally, more accurate results can be gained in Virtual Test Drive simulations. Furthermore, the simulation of radiation characteristics of vehicle roof antennas can be accelerated.","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228339.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combination of a full-wave method and ray tracing for radiation pattern simulations of antennas on vehicle roofs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228339/","displayDocTitle":"Combination of a full-wave method and ray tracing for radiation pattern simulations of antennas on vehicle roofs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416773","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7228339/","conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combination of a full-wave method and ray tracing for radiation pattern simulations of antennas on vehicle roofs","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570047363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062018S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7228349,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Pascual-Garcia","affiliation":["Dpto.

In this work appropriate model parameters values are assigned to the different materials of an indoor environment in a ray tracing tool.

Recently, dyadic DGF has been derived from the impulse response of the discretized scalar wave equation (i.e., scalar DGF) with the use of the multidimensional Z-transform. Its software implementation is straightforward because only elementary functions are involved and a single function requires computations in the multipleprecision arithmetic. Since the proposed formulation is based on scalar DGF, it allows to estimate steady-state values of dyadic DGF with the use of the windowing technique applied to scalar DGF. Applications of the proposed DGF formulation are demonstrated in basic simulation scenarios facilitated by the time-domain diakoptics approach.","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228418.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD-Compatible Green's function based on scalar discrete Green's function and multidimensional Z-transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228418/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD-Compatible Green's function based on scalar discrete Green's function and multidimensional Z-transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416549","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7228418/","conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD-Compatible Green's function based on scalar discrete Green's function and multidimensional Z-transform","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570049853.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064334S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228423,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Due to increasing complexity, higher package density or taking into account environmental aspects, the simulation effort is steadily rising, so simulation acceleration techniques become more and more important. Solutions based on graphic cards (GPU) are expensive and limited in usable memory. This paper presents the XPU technology which is a smart implementation of the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) algorithm on modern CPU architectures. It can drastically reduce simulation times while (in contrast to GPU solutions) maintaining full access to the available main memory. Simulations of a 77 GHz radar sensor integrated into a car as well as a wireless vehicle charging system simulation show how the XPU technique is applied to state-of-the-art RF systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228423.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228423","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"XPU technology for fast and efficient FDTD simulations using modern CPUs cache memory bandwidth","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Radar antennas","Computer architecture","Radar","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","electric fields","finite difference time-domain analysis","microcomputers","submillimetre wave antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["XPU technology","finite difference time domain algorithm","FDTD simulations","CPU cache memory bandwidth","EM simulations","antenna design","RF components","package density","simulation acceleration techniques","graphic cards","GPU","CPU architectures","radar sensor","wireless vehicle charging system","RF systems","frequency 77 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["EM simulation","acceleration techniques","FDTD","Computer Technology","GPU","Antennas","RF components","Radar","77 GHz","Wireless charging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228423/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"XPU technology for fast and efficient FDTD simulations using modern CPUs cache memory bandwidth","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7228423/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416150","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"XPU technology for fast and efficient FDTD simulations using modern CPUs cache memory bandwidth","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570050107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055935S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228425,"authors":[{"name":"Chris J Railton","affiliation":["Centre for Communications Research, University of Bristol, Bristol, England"],"firstName":"Chris J","lastName":"Railton","id":"37271065200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0185-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0182-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"7228425","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":66},"abstract":"Although the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is well established for addressing a wide variety problems including the characterization of antenna arrays, a long standing challenge is to reduce discretization errors while avoiding the use of impractically large numbers of cells, particularly when the structure is large and contains regions of fine detail. One solution is to use subgrids. In most published work, Cartesian subgrids are proposed which are in the same orientation as the main grid. However there is considerable benefit to allowing for the subgrid to be tilted. In this work, a method for introducing a tilted subgrid into the 2D FDTD mesh is presented and its effectiveness, accuracy and stability is demonstrated using examples. The method is readily extendable to a full 3D implementation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228425.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A tilted subgrid for two dimensional FDTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Antenna arrays","Probes","Interpolation","Finite element analysis","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","finite difference time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two dimensional FDTD","tilted subgrid","finite difference time domain","antenna arrays","discretization errors","Cartesian subgrids","2D FDTD mesh"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FDTD methods","subgridding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A tilted subgrid for two dimensional FDTD","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7228425/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416457","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A tilted subgrid for two dimensional FDTD","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570050169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037549S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228430,"authors":[{"name":"Nektarios Moraitis","affiliation":["Mobile Radio Communications Laboratory, National Technical University of Athens, Zografou, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Nektarios","lastName":"Moraitis","id":"37267333700"},{"name":"Athanasios D.

A single-layer CMRC is etched on the PCB between the PIFA elements to improve isolation between them. Computer simulation is used to study and design the MIMO antenna. Results show that the CMRC can increase isolation between the two PIFA elements by 10 dB in the 2.4-GHz WLAN band.

Dense multipath scattering with multipath components arriving in clusters was observed. This is due to the abundance of highly reflective scatterers present in the measured industrial environments. The measurement results reveal two different shapes of PDP, neither of which fully fits the well known Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) model or power-law model. Thus, modifications were made on the conventional S-V model and power-law model to better represent the measurement results.

The underlying concept is based on the TCM (Theory of Characteristic Modes) and is realized in an EM-simulator using 9 single antenna elements combined in a 3\u00d73 antenna array. The excitation of the modes with low eigenvalues on each element is realized by three sets of slots at predefined positions on a PCB (Printed Circuit Board). These selective excitations on each antenna element result in an excitation of four current distributions and care for a low mutual coupling on the terminal itself. Combining these single elements in the 3\u00d73 antenna array a decoupled 36-Port antenna system can be achieved. The results of the simulations show that all 36 antenna ports operate in the EU-UWB band and cover the frequency range of 5.725GHz-5.85 GHz, including the IEEE 802.1ac standard. This design method for a multi-mode MIMO antenna system is a straight forward application of the TCM and is therefore of general interest.","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228532.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO antenna concept based on Characteristic Modes for indoor base stations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO antenna concept based on Characteristic Modes for indoor base stations","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228532/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416673","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7228532/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO antenna concept based on Characteristic Modes for indoor base stations","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570052467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038816S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228537,"authors":[{"name":"Kimmo Rasilainen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Anlto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Kimmo","lastName":"Rasilainen","id":"37706175400"},{"name":"Anu Lehtovuori","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Anlto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Anu","lastName":"Lehtovuori","id":"37662289900"},{"name":"Janne Ilvonen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Anlto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Janne","lastName":"Ilvonen","id":"37304154900"},{"name":"Jari Holopainen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Anlto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Jari","lastName":"Holopainen","id":"37319771800"},{"name":"Risto Valkonen","affiliation":["Institute for Electrical and Information Eng., Faculty of Engineering, Kiel, Germany"],"firstName":"Risto","lastName":"Valkonen","id":"37319773100"},{"name":"Ville Viikari","affiliation":["Department of Radio Science and Engineering, Anlto University, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville","lastName":"Viikari","id":"37270535600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0185-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0182-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"7228537","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Tuning","Telephone sets","Antenna accessories","Impedance","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","mobile antennas","mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless communication systems","frequency bands","data rates","handset antennas","frequency-reconfigurable multiple-input multiple-output antennas","frequency-reconfigurable MIMO antennas","user-originated impedance detuning losses","tuning circuit","antenna design","independently frequency-reconfigurable antenna elements","LTE-A bands","small handsets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitive coupling element antenna","digitally tunable capacitor","MIMO antenna","tunable antenna","4G antenna"]}],"abstract":"In today's wireless communication systems, the need for more frequency bands and higher data rates provides challenges for designing compact, efficient, and environment-insensitive handset antennas. One way of obtaining this is by using frequency-reconfigurable Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) antennas to both minimise the antenna volume and to compensate for user-originated impedance detuning losses. The current work contributes to describing the challenges or issues that have to be taken into account when designing well-performing frequency-tunable MIMO antennas. Obtaining this goal requires co-design of both the antenna and the tuning circuit used. An example antenna design is used to illustrate the different aspects of this work. The design features independently frequency-reconfigurable antenna elements that are able to cover most of the LTE-A bands. The performance of the example design in terms of antenna volume, bandwidth, and efficiency makes it a viable candidate for practical tunable MIMO implementations.","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228537.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunable MIMO antenna for small handsets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228537","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Tunable MIMO antenna for small handsets","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228537/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416600","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7228537/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunable MIMO antenna for small handsets","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570052485.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062783S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228542,"authors":[{"name":"Abhishek Dey","affiliation":["Center for Wireless and Microwave Information Systems (WAMI), Electrical Eng., Univ of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Dey","id":"38580498000"},{"name":"Asimina Kiourti","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Asimina","lastName":"Kiourti","id":"37870860300"},{"name":"Gokhan Mumcu","affiliation":["Center for Wireless and Microwave Information Systems (WAMI), Electrical Eng., Univ of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Gokhan","lastName":"Mumcu","id":"37281458200"},{"name":"John L.

A novel partially reflective surface (PRS), consisting of square patches and mesh grids etched on both sides of dielectric substrate, is designed to operate at 10 GHz. In the proposed design, the sizes of square patches and mesh grids can be adjusted separately, which provides two methods to achieve tilted-beam: one is to vary the sizes of square patches to change the E-field phase distribution on the surface of PRS; the other is to change the dimensions of mesh grids to obtain tilted beam. Simulation results show that it can obtain a gain of 13.7 dBi for a 23\u00b0 beam tilting and 13.4 dBi for a 27\u00b0 beam tilting using the first and second method, respectively. This proposed antenna has the advantages of low profile, low cost and high gain, thus promising for fixed and tilted beam applications in mobile communication base stations and radars.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228561.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-profile high-gain tilted-beam Fabry-Perot antenna","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microstrip antenna arrays","Reflection","Microwave antenna arrays","Broadband antennas","Cavity resonators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","microstrip antennas","mobile antennas","mobile communication","radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-profile high-gain tilted beam Fabry-Perot antenna","low-profile high-gain tilted beam FP antenna","partially reflective surface","PRS","square patch","mesh grid","dielectric substrate","E-field phase distribution","mobile communication base station","radar base station","frequency 10 GHz","gain 13.4 dB to 13.7 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low profile","high gain","tilted beam","Fabry Perot"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low-profile high-gain tilted-beam Fabry-Perot antenna","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7228561/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416717","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-profile high-gain tilted-beam Fabry-Perot antenna","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570052597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063011S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228590,"authors":[{"name":"Richard J.

In this paper we propose to study the performance of a scheme resulting from the combination of the OFDM-IDMA architecture and the transmit diversity system designed by adopting space-time coded transmittion (STBC) and equipping the transmitter with multiple antennas. Furthermore, we propose a novel structure for the interleaver, the key block in the IDMA combined structure. The resulting architecture we have chosen to refer to as STBC-OFDM-IDMA is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance. The architecture is designed to exploit the features of OFDM in increasing the robustness against inter-symbol interference (ISI), the IDMA in protecting against the multiple access interference (MAI), and the STBC in improving the reliability of the wireless link.

We are interested in parsimonious mathematical channel models, in which only significant groups of multipath components (MPCs) are included. The MPCs are grouped in the delay-Doppler domain, which enables the development of cluster-based channel models. However, the characterization of time-variant vehicular channel parameters based on a joint clustering-and-tracking framework has not been adequately studied previously. In this paper, we focus on the cluster lifetime characterization for vehicular communication channels. A joint cluster identification-and-tracking approach based on the local scattering function (LSF) is applied, which takes the delay and Doppler domains into consideration. The proposed approach uses a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm for identification. The cluster centroid tracking is based on the multipath component distance (MCD) matrix. We apply this approach to real-world vehicular channel measurements. The time-varying cluster lifetimes are tracked according via the cluster centroids for two scenarios. The results indicate that the detected cluster related to the line-of-sight (LOS) component persists throughout the measurement run and contributes the highest gain level for both scenarios. The clusters detected from traffic signs and large moving vehicles also persist for a longer period, whereas many clusters associated with discrete scatterers along the roadside appear for very short periods.","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228756.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster lifetime characterization for vehicular communication channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228756/","displayDocTitle":"Cluster lifetime characterization for vehicular communication channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416432","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7228756/","conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster lifetime characterization for vehicular communication channels","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570053395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079555S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228778,"authors":[{"name":"Mustapha Chouiha","affiliation":["Ecole Militaire Polytechnique technique, Laboratoire Syst\u00e8mes de Communications, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Mustapha","lastName":"Chouiha","id":"37074284500"},{"name":"Abdelhakim Khouas","affiliation":["stitut de G\u00e9nie Electrique et Electronique, University M'Hamed Bougara, Boumerd\u00e8s, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdelhakim","lastName":"Khouas","id":"37085690272"},{"name":"Adel Belouchrani","affiliation":["Electrlcal Engineering Departement, Ecole Nationale Pnlytechnique, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Adel","lastName":"Belouchrani","id":"37284579700"},{"name":"Genevieve Baudoin","affiliation":["Syst\u00e8mes de Communications et Microsystmes, Laboratoire d'Electronique, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Genevieve","lastName":"Baudoin","id":"37085362479"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0185-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-8-8907-0182-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-3342"}],"articleNumber":"7228778","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"abstract":"In this paper, a new carrier synchronization loop for high-order QAM signals has been proposed in which a blind source separation algorithm for carrier phase tracking is used as phase estimator in feed-back configuration.

Throughput and power consumption per mobile terminal (MT) are provided as output metrics, and compared to other subcarrier allocation strategies. The system platform, which is compatible with all studied strategies, carries out a sufficient number of independent Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for different network orientations. Each MC comprises two stages. In the first stage, base stations (BSs) assign their available subcarriers to the MTs without any Channel State Information (CSI), and in the last stage the MTs try to fully recover the transmitted signal. Results indicate that the RAJSS strategy outperforms the other studied strategies, in terms of BER-Throughput gain and algorithmic fairness. However, algorithmic complexity of the RAJSS algorithm is increased; hence in low Signal to Noise (SNR) scenarios simulations time span is apparently high. RAJSS is, finally, compared to a strategy which assigns to the terminals the subcarriers which show the best quality (highest SNR). To do so, CSI is considered. In this case and in some scenarios, RAJSS algorithm has improved performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation

The LTE/DAB-L antenna operates at frequency bands - from 698 MHz to 960 MHz and from 1427.9 MHz to 2700 MHz - covering available LTE frequencies. This antenna has a high efficiency due to panel design and obtains monopole characteristics in all LTE frequencies. In combination with GNSS and SDARS ring antennas the structure yields a sufficient decoupling to these antennas. This is even true for the SDARS antenna sharing the same phase center with the LTE-antenna.

The feed chain system is based on a recently proposed configuration that uses a diplexer and a bi-phase polarizer conveniently joined by a single mode waveguide. This solution leads to compact low-cost feed designs well suited for multi-beam antennas with a single feed per beam in the context of satellite communications. A new design with enhanced performance is presented with simulated results of axial ratio below 0.2 dB across 18.2-20.2 GHz and 28-30 GHz. Moreover, the impact of the finite return loss of the high efficiency horn is studied and a compensated high-performance feed is presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7209133/7228134/07228923.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 9th European Conference on Antennas and Propagation (EuCAP)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7228134","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7228923","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wide-band compact antenna feed for multi-beam satellite communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna feeds","Horn antennas","Dual band","Satellite antennas","Rectangular waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna feeds","broadband antennas","microwave antennas","millimetre wave antennas","multiplexing equipment","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multibeam satellite communications","wideband compact antenna feed","dual band single circular polarization","feed chain system","diplexer","bi-phase polarizer","single mode waveguide","compact low-cost feed designs","multibeam antennas","frequency 18.2 GHz to 20.2 GHz","frequency 28 GHz to 30 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["antenna feed","satellite communications","waveguide","circular polarization","dual-band","polarizer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7228923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-17 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Wide-band compact antenna feed for multi-beam satellite communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7228923/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15416604","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"13-17 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wide-band compact antenna feed for multi-beam satellite communications","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"1570054297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07336S","chronDate":"13-17 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7209133","isNumber":"7228134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7209133","xplore-issue":"7228134","articleId":"7228923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EurAAP","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7228937,"authors":[{"name":"Sooyoung Hur","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Korea"],"firstName":"Sooyoung","lastName":"Hur","id":"37696738400"},{"name":"Sangkyu Baek","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangkyu","lastName":"Baek","id":"37085564203"},{"name":"ByungChul Kim","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Korea"],"firstName":"ByungChul","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085406791"},{"name":"JeongHo Park","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Korea"],"firstName":"JeongHo","lastName":"Park","id":"38107934000"},{"name":"Andreas F.

The algorithm of the FDTD method is based on the Yee cell. The Yee cell is a space-time discretization of Maxwell's equations. The performance of the FDTD method is limited by the bandwidth of the traditional algorithm. When describing the dynamics of Maxwell equations through slabs or spatiotemporal macro-cells larger than the Yee cell, the re-use of calculated fields is increased.

Elastic networks, based on Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing or optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing, can efficiently utilize the optical fiber's bandwidth in an elastic manner by partitioning the bandwidth into hundreds or even thousands of subcarriers. Beside the amplified spontaneous emission noise, the nonlinear impairments of each connection is explicitly considered by utilizing an analytical model to calculate the nonlinear interference from other connections propagating in the same fibers. The objective of our work is to minimize the bandwidth, i.e., the number of used subcarriers across the network, while satisfying the demands on throughput and quality for all connections. A novel integer linear program formulation and low-complexity heuristics are proposed. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Compared with transmission reach-based benchmark methods, our methods can achieve up to 31% bandwidth reduction.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7286894/07229240.pdf","startPage":"4554","endPage":"4564","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2474130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2474130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7286894","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Impairment-Aware Static Resource Allocation in Elastic Optical Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Optical fiber networks","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer programming","linear programming","OFDM modulation","optical communication","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity heuristics","integer linear program formulation","nonlinear interference","analytical model","amplified spontaneous emission noise","optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing","Nyquist wavelength-division multiplexing","elastic optical networks","nonlinear impairment-aware static resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NWDM","OOFDM","elastic optical networks","routing and spectrum assignment","physical impairments"]},{"kwd":["Elastic optical networks","NWDM","OOFDM","physical impairments","routing and spectrum assignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.15, 15 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Impairment-Aware Static Resource Allocation in Elastic Optical Networks","volume":"33","issue":"22","htmlLink":"/document/7229240/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"15 Nov.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"15488905","dateOfInsertion":"01 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001862","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council","grantNumber":"2012-5280"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Impairment-Aware Static Resource Allocation in Elastic Optical Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-zhao-2474130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128384S","chronDate":"Nov.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7286894","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7286894","articleId":"7229240","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229243,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben S.

Experimental observations using a seven-core MCF over a period of 10 h show that, unlike localized crosstalk, distributed crosstalk power transfer has a pronounced modulation frequency response which changes substantially over time. This response is described using an adaptation of previous crosstalk models for MCFs showing that it results from the random time-varying interference between crosstalk contributions generated at a discrete number of phase matching points along the fiber. The model is used to produce simplified empirical models to characterize its average and variance. It is shown that both these quantities are nonzero and nearly constant for modulation frequencies above the inverse of the time skew between cores. These observations are validated by experimental data.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2474128","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7405362/07229243.pdf","startPage":"441","endPage":"447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2474128","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7405362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Time and Modulation Frequency Dependence of Crosstalk in Homogeneous Multi-Core Fibers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229243","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229243/","displayDocTitle":"Time and Modulation Frequency Dependence of Crosstalk in Homogeneous Multi-Core Fibers","volume":"34","issue":"2","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2016","accessionNumber":"15786118","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229243/","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Time and Modulation Frequency Dependence of Crosstalk in Homogeneous Multi-Core Fibers","sourcePdf":"jlt-luis-2474128-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110715S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2016","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7405362","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7405362","articleId":"7229243","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229259,"authors":[{"name":"Iraklis Giannakis","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Institute for Infrastructure and Environment, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7394958/7229259/giani-2468597-small.gif","p":["Iraklis Giannakis received the B.Sc. degree in geology and the M.Sc. degree in geophysics from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

Two bowtie GPR transducers are chosen for the simulations and two widely employed antipersonnel (AP) landmines, namely PMA-1 and PMN are used. The validity of the modeled antennas and landmines is tested through a comparison between numerical and laboratory measurements. The modeled AP landmines are buried in a realistically simulated soil. The geometrical characteristics of soil's inhomogeneity are modeled using fractal correlated noise, which gives rise to Gaussian semivariograms often encountered in the field. Fractals are also employed in order to simulate the roughness of the soil's surface. A frequency-dependent complex electrical permittivity model is used for the dielectric properties of the soil, which relates both the velocity and the attenuation of the electromagnetic waves with the soil's bulk density, sand particles density, clay fraction, sand fraction, and volumetric water fraction.

Thus, it is desirable to analyze the NoC yield in an early design phase. A Monte Carlo (MC) approach was proposed for the NoC yield analysis at the system level; however, it is inefficient due to the requirement of a large number of simulation runs. In this paper, we propose a Gibbs sampling approach, which can efficiently generate failed NoC instances as simulation samples, for yield estimation. This approach significantly reduces the number of required simulation runs for obtaining an accurate yield estimation. Implementation issues, such as initial sample selection, calculation of conditional distributions, and stop criterion, to customize Gibbs sampling for the NoC yield analysis are discussed. Potential optimization opportunities to further improve Gibbs sampling's efficiency are also explored. Compared to the MC approach, our experimental results show that the proposed approach can reduce the simulation runtime by 5\u00d7-100\u00d7 for a high-yield NoC (a failure rate at 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2</sup>\n-10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-5</sup>\n), while achieving the same level of accuracy for yield estimation.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474401","startPage":"447","endPage":"457","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7419205/07229262.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Network-on-Chip Yield Estimation Approach Based on Gibbs Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Network-on-Chip Yield Estimation Approach Based on Gibbs Sampling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","volume":"35","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229262/","accessionNumber":"15802937","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229262/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61204030"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Nonprofit Technology Research Projects","grantNumber":"2014C31045"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"LY15F020008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Network-on-Chip Yield Estimation Approach Based on Gibbs Sampling","sourcePdf":"tcad-lan-2474401-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078112S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7419205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7419205","articleId":"7229262","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7229264,"authors":[{"name":"Filipp Akopyan","affiliation":["IBM Research\u2014Almaden, San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Filipp Akopyan (M\u201904) was born in Moscow, Russia.

This type of intelligent computing poses a set of constraints, including real-time operation, low-power consumption and scalability, which require a radical departure from conventional system design. Brain-inspired architectures offer tremendous promise in this area. To this end, we developed TrueNorth, a 65 mW real-time neurosynaptic processor that implements a non-von Neumann, low-power, highly-parallel, scalable, and defect-tolerant architecture. With 4096 neurosynaptic cores, the TrueNorth chip contains 1 million digital neurons and 256 million synapses tightly interconnected by an event-driven routing infrastructure. The fully digital 5.4 billion transistor implementation leverages existing CMOS scaling trends, while ensuring one-to-one correspondence between hardware and software. With such aggressive design metrics and the TrueNorth architecture breaking path with prevailing architectures, it is clear that conventional computer-aided design (CAD) tools could not be used for the design. As a result, we developed a novel design methodology that includes mixed asynchronous-synchronous circuits and a complete tool flow for building an event-driven, low-power neurosynaptic chip. The TrueNorth chip is fully configurable in terms of connectivity and neural parameters to allow custom configurations for a wide range of cognitive and sensory perception applications. To reduce the system's communication energy, we have adapted existing application-agnostic very large-scale integration CAD placement tools for mapping logical neural networks to the physical neurosynaptic core locations on the TrueNorth chips. With that, we have successfully demonstrated the use of TrueNorth-based systems in multiple applications, including visual object recognition, with higher performance and orders of magnitude lower power consumption than the same algorithms run on von Neumann architectures. The TrueNorth chip and its tool flow serve as building blocks for future cognitive systems, and give designers an opportunity to develop novel brain-inspired architectures and systems based on the knowledge obtained from this paper.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7271134/07229264.pdf","startPage":"1537","endPage":"1557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TrueNorth: Design and Tool Flow of a 65 mW 1 Million Neuron Programmable Neurosynaptic Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"TrueNorth: Design and Tool Flow of a 65 mW 1 Million Neuron Programmable Neurosynaptic Chip","volume":"34","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229264/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15457295","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229264/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","grantNumber":"HR0011-09-C-0002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TrueNorth: Design and Tool Flow of a 65 mW 1 Million Neuron Programmable Neurosynaptic Chip","sourcePdf":"tcad-akopyan-2474396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118937S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7271134","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"460","xplore-issue":"7271134","articleId":"7229264","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7229268,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Beneventi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7435365/7229268/benev-2474382-small.gif","p":["Francesco Beneventi received the engineering degree in electronic engineering from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2010.","He has been a Research Assistant with the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering \u201cGuglielmo Marconi,\u201d University of Bologna, since 2011.

We correlate temperature measurements with the power dissipated by the heaters using model learning techniques. Moreover, we defined a thermal basis function obtained using power and thermal data available from the on-chip sensors. This function can be used to predict temperatures at chip locations far from the temperature sensors and to infer the power dissipation at any location of the chip. In addition, the same thermal basic function can be used jointly with formal interpolation frameworks like radial basis function methods to effectively estimate the full-chip thermal map. Results show that this methodology outperforms existing interpolation approaches for sparse integrated sensors.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474382","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

They are stealthy and can have unrestricted access to system resources. This paper presents NumChecker, a new virtual machine (VM) monitor based framework to detect and identify control-flow modifying kernel rootkits in a guest VM. NumChecker detects and identifies malicious modifications to a system call in the guest VM by measuring the number of certain hardware events that occur during the system call's execution. To automatically count these events, NumChecker leverages the hardware performance counters (HPCs), which exist in modern processors. By using HPCs, the checking cost is significantly reduced and the tamper-resistance is enhanced. We implement a prototype of NumChecker on Linux with the kernel-based VM. An HPC-based two-phase kernel rootkit detection and identification technique is presented and evaluated on a number of real-world kernel rootkits. The results demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474374","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7419205/07229276.pdf","startPage":"485","endPage":"498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474374","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reusing Hardware Performance Counters to Detect and Identify Kernel Control-Flow Modifying Rootkits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229276/","displayDocTitle":"Reusing Hardware Performance Counters to Detect and Identify Kernel Control-Flow Modifying Rootkits","volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15802948","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229276/","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"FA8750-10-2-0101"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reusing Hardware Performance Counters to Detect and Identify Kernel Control-Flow Modifying Rootkits","sourcePdf":"tcad-wang-2474374-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137725S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7419205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7419205","articleId":"7229276","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229278,"authors":[{"name":"Jianlei Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7419205/7229278/yang-2474366-small.gif","p":["Jianlei Yang (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in microelectronics from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2014.","He is currently a Post-Doctoral Researcher with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

However, the reliability of STT-MRAM is severely impacted by environmental disturbances because radiation strike on the access transistor could introduce potential write and read failures for 1T1MTJ cells. In this paper, a comprehensive approach is proposed to evaluate the radiation-induced soft errors spanning from device modeling to circuit level analysis. The simulation based on 3-D metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor modeling is first performed to capture the radiation-induced transient current pulse. Then a compact switching model of magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) is developed to analyze the various mechanisms of STT-MRAM write failures. The probability of failure of 1T1MTJ is characterized and built as look-up-tables. This approach enables designers to consider the effect of different factors such as radiation strength, write current magnitude and duration time on soft error rate of STT-MRAM memory arrays. Meanwhile, comprehensive write and sense circuits are evaluated for bit error rate analysis under random radiation effects and transistors process variation, which is critical for performance optimization of practical STT-MRAM read and sense circuits.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Switches","Transistors","Switching circuits","Magnetization","Resistance","Integrated circuit modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","MOSFET","MRAM devices","probability","radiation hardening (electronics)","semiconductor device models","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STT-MRAM read circuits","transistor process variation","random radiation effects","bit error rate analysis","sense circuits","STT-MRAM memory arrays","soft error rate","write current magnitude","radiation strength","look-up-tables","compact switching model","radiation-induced transient current pulse","3D metal-oxide-semiconductor transistor modeling","circuit level analysis","device modeling","radiation-induced soft errors","1T1MTJ cells","magnetic tunneling junction","access transistor","memory technology","STT-MRAM write failures","spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory","radiation-induced soft error analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Soft Error","STT-MRAM","Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ)","Radiation"]},{"kwd":["Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)","radiation","soft error","spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229278","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474366","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7419205/07229278.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474366","startPage":"380","endPage":"393","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419205","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation-Induced Soft Error Analysis of STT-MRAM: A Device to Circuit Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Radiation-Induced Soft Error Analysis of STT-MRAM: A Device to Circuit Approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229278/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","volume":"35","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7229278/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15802946","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1116171 and CCF-1217947"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation-Induced Soft Error Analysis of STT-MRAM: A Device to Circuit Approach","sourcePdf":"tcad-yang-2474366-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087508S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7419205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7419205","articleId":"7229278","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7229279,"authors":[{"name":"Soumitra Pal","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology, Ranchi, Jharkhand, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7435365/7229279/pal-2474408-small.gif","p":["Soumitra Pal (S\u201914) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and instrumentation engineering from the Bankura Unnayani Institute of Engineering, Bankura, India, in 2012, and the M.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the Birla Institute of Technology (Deemed University), Ranchi, India, in 2015.","He has authored or coauthored over 14 research papers in reputed journals (5, 4- in SCOPUS indexed journal), one book chapter and eight conferences.

Such attacks are often referred to as hardware Trojans. While many techniques focus on hardware Trojan detection during IC testing, it is still possible for attacks to go undetected. Using a combination of new design techniques and new memory technologies, we present a new approach that detects a wide variety of hardware Trojans during IC testing and also during system operation in the field. Our approach can also prevent a wide variety of attacks during synthesis, place-and-route, and fabrication of ICs. It can be applied to any digital system, and can be tuned for both traditional and split-manufacturing methods. We demonstrate its applicability for both application-specified integrated circuits and field-programmable gate arrays. Using fabricated test chips with Trojan emulation capabilities and also using simulations, we demonstrate: 1) the area and power costs of our approach can range between 7.4%-165% and 7%-60%, respectively, depending on the design and the attacks targeted; 2) the speed impact can be minimal (close to 0%); 3) our approach can detect 99.998% of Trojans (emulated using test chips) that do not require detailed knowledge of the design being attacked; 4) our approach can prevent 99.98% of specific attacks (simulated) that utilize detailed knowledge of the design being attacked (e.g., through reverse engineering); and 5) our approach never produces any false positives, i.e., it does not report attacks when the IC operates correctly.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7435365/07229283.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7435365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TPAD: Hardware Trojan Prevention and Detection for Trusted Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"TPAD: Hardware Trojan Prevention and Detection for Trusted Integrated Circuits","volume":"35","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2016","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2016","accessionNumber":"15869997","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229283/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IARPA Trusted Integrated Chips Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TPAD: Hardware Trojan Prevention and Detection for Trusted Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tcad-wu-2474373-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17461S","chronDate":"April  2016","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"7435365","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"7435365","articleId":"7229283","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7229286,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Won Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jun Won","lastName":"Choi","id":"37405961800"},{"name":"Byonghyo Shim","affiliation":["Institute of New Media and Communications and Schoolof Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Byonghyo","lastName":"Shim","id":"37277951300"},{"name":"Seok-Ho Chang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Dankook University, Yongin, Korea"],"firstName":"Seok-Ho","lastName":"Chang","id":"37407122000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7229286","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1411},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Downlink","MIMO","Resource management","Antennas","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel estimation","compressed sensing","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive MIMO systems","downlink pilot reduction","compressed sensing","multiple-input multiple-output systems","frequency division duplex systems","FDD systems","radio resources","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","sparse channel estimation","consecutive channel impulse response","antenna arrays"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","compressed sensing","downlink pilot allocation","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]},{"kwd":["Channel estimation","compressed sensing","downlink pilot allocation","massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"This letter addresses a problem of downlink pilot allocation for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. When a massive MIMO is employed in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, significant amount of radio resources are dedicated to the transmission of downlink pilots. Such huge pilot overhead leads to a substantial loss in the maximum data throughput, which motivates us to reduce the number of pilots. In this letter, we propose a pilot reduction strategy based on compressed sensing techniques for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems. The pilots are randomly located in a low density manner over the time and frequency domain. To estimate the channels with such low density pilots, we propose a novel sparse channel estimation technique that exploits the common support of the consecutive channel impulse responses over the certain time duration. The evaluation shows that for a massive MIMO with 128 antennas, the proposed scheme achieves significant reduction of pilot overhead, while maintaining good channel estimation performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink Pilot Reduction for Massive MIMO Systems via Compressed Sensing","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2474398","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7322307/07229286.pdf","startPage":"1889","endPage":"1892","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2474398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229286","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229286/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Downlink Pilot Reduction for Massive MIMO Systems via Compressed Sensing","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7229286/","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587156","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002701","fundingName":"Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"NRF-2014R1A1A2055805"},{"fundingName":"Human Resources Program in Energy Technology of the KETEP"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea","grantNumber":"20154030200900"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink Pilot Reduction for Massive MIMO Systems via Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"lcomm-chang-2474398-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058037S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7322307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7322307","articleId":"7229286","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229289,"authors":[{"name":"Bajaj Ronak","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7435365/7229289/ronak-2474363-small.gif","p":["Bajaj Ronak (S\u201912) received the B.Tech. degree in electronics and communication engineering from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H), Hyderabad, India, in 2010.

This is done by delaying scheduling until after the graph has been partitioned onto DSP blocks and scheduled based on their pipeline structure, resulting in a throughput optimized implementation.

The shell elements are modeled by doubling the essential variables on the surface. The link between the two sides of the surface is governed by the circuit Y matrix obtained from the unit cell model.

Without partitioning SLC and MLC blocks, scatter-SLC can eliminate the unbalanced lifetime between SLC and MLC blocks while achieving the similar error rate as the method to store metadata in SLC blocks.

Since not all EV drivers would like to be environmentally friendly, all vehicles in the CS are divided into three categories: 1) premium; 2) conservative; and 3) green, according to their charging behavior. Premium and conservative EVs are considered interested only in charging their batteries, with noticeably higher rates of charging for premium EVs. Green vehicles are more environmentally friendly and thus assist the CS to reduce its cost of energy trading by allowing the CS to use their batteries as distributed storage. A different charging scheme is proposed for each type of EV, which is adopted by the CS to encourage more EVs to be green. A basic mixed-integer programming (MIP) technique is used to facilitate the proposed classification scheme. It is shown that the uncertainty in PV generation can be effectively compensated, along with minimization of total cost of energy trading to the CS, by consolidating more green EVs. Real solar and pricing data are used for performance analysis of the system. It is demonstrated that the total cost to the CS reduces considerably as the percentage of green vehicles increases and that the contributions of green EVs in winter are greater than those in summer.","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2462824","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7361014/07229307.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2462824","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7361014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost Minimization of Charging Stations With Photovoltaics: An Approach With EV Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229307/","displayDocTitle":"Cost Minimization of Charging Stations With Photovoltaics: An Approach With EV Classification","volume":"17","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15669285","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229307/","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100007040","fundingName":"Singapore University of Technology and Design"},{"fundingName":"Energy Innovation Research Program (EIRP) Singapore","grantNumber":"NRF2012EWT-EIRP002-045"},{"fundingName":"NICTA"},{"fundingName":"Australian Government"},{"fundingName":"Department of Communications"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost Minimization of Charging Stations With Photovoltaics: An Approach With EV Classification","sourcePdf":"tits-tushar-2462824-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142762S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7361014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"7361014","articleId":"7229307","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229310,"authors":[{"name":"Rajitha Senanayake","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Rajitha","lastName":"Senanayake","id":"38667048400"},{"name":"Peter Smith","affiliation":["School of Mathematics and Statistics, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Smith","id":"37085365018"},{"name":"Phee Lep Yeoh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Parkville, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Phee Lep","lastName":"Yeoh","id":"37391664100"},{"name":"Jamie Evans","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Jamie","lastName":"Evans","id":"37269068700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7229310","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":952},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this letter, we present a new theoretical analysis of the performance of a massive MIMO network with distributed receive antennas. We consider the uplink of a cooperative cellular network that jointly detects signals from multiple transmitters with a large number of distributed antennas. Applying zero-forcing (ZF) across the receivers, we present our accurate approximation for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of an arbitrary user with Rayleigh fading, path loss and shadowing. We further derive easy-to-evaluate closed-form expressions for the symbol error probability (SEP) and the achievable rate of an arbitrary user. Numerical examples highlight that our novel results provide accurate approximations for the performance of a distributed massive MIMO network.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7322307/07229310.pdf","startPage":"1885","endPage":"1888","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2474377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2474377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322307","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An SNR Approximation for Distributed Massive MIMO With Zero Forcing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Antenna arrays","Transmitters","Approximation methods","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cooperative communication","error statistics","MIMO communication","radio transmitters","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SNR approximation","distributed massive MIMO network","zero forcing","distributed receive antennas","cooperative cellular network","multiple transmitters","signal-to-noise ratio","arbitrary user","Rayleigh fading","path loss","path shadowing","symbol error probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Zero Forcing","Massive MIMO","Distributed antenna arrays"]},{"kwd":["Zero forcing","massive MIMO","distributed antenna arrays"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"An SNR Approximation for Distributed Massive MIMO With Zero Forcing","volume":"19","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7229310/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587169","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An SNR Approximation for Distributed Massive MIMO With Zero Forcing","sourcePdf":"lcomm-senanayake-2474377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083707S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7322307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7322307","articleId":"7229310","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229311,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/8307205/7229311/chen-2474403-small.gif","p":["Chien-Hung Chen received the BS degree in computer science and\n information engineering from the Chung Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2008, and the MS degree in computer science\n and information engineering from Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei, Taiwan, in 2012.

Some MapReduce jobs have the deadline requirements for their job execution. The existing deadline-constrained MapReduce scheduling schemes do not consider the following two problems: various node performance and dynamical task execution time. In this paper, we utilize the Bipartite Graph modelling to propose a new MapReduce Scheduler called the BGMRS. The BGMRS can obtain the optimal solution of the deadline-constrained scheduling problem by transforming the problem into a well-known graph problem: minimum weighted bipartite matching. The BGMRS has the following features. It considers the heterogeneous cloud computing environment, such that the computing resources of some nodes cannot meet the deadlines of some jobs. In addition to meeting the deadline requirement, the BGMRS also takes the data locality into the computing resource allocation for shortening the data access time of a job. However, if the total available computing resources of the system cannot satisfy the deadline requirements of all jobs, the BGMRS can minimize the number of jobs with the deadline violation. Finally, both simulation and testbed experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the BGMRS in the deadline-constrained scheduling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229311/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633487","htmlLink":"/document/7229311/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","volume":"6","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"MapReduce Scheduling for Deadline-Constrained Jobs in Heterogeneous Cloud Computing Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC 102-2221-E-002-136-MY3 and NSC 102-2221-E-030-010-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MapReduce Scheduling for Deadline-Constrained Jobs in Heterogeneous Cloud Computing Systems","sourcePdf":"tcc-lin-2474403-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120507S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8307205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"8307205","articleId":"7229311","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229312,"authors":[{"name":"Bruce M.

The technique involves first finding DC parameters that are \u201csignatures\u201d of each mechanism. Then, separate DC-stress lifetests are performed to find the degradation rates for the signature parameters, at several temperatures, and the corresponding Arrhenius curves. Next, an RF-stress lifetest (with only one stress condition) is performed, while monitoring all of the signature parameters and the RF performance. This is utilized to determine the \u201cscaling factors\u201d between the rates of change in the DC lifetests and the rates of change in the RF application. Applying these scaling factors to the original Arrhenius curves gives an \u201coverall\u201d Arrhenius plot for the RF application with several different lines, for the different degradation mechanisms. The technique can be extended to further degradation mechanisms, by conducting further DC and RF lifetests while monitoring appropriate signature parameters.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229312/","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7229312/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15647608","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Lifetesting GaN HEMTs With Multiple Degradation Mechanisms","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"FA8650-11-2-1187"},{"fundingName":"Boeing Network and Space Systems Internal Research and Development program (Remy Hiramoto)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Lifetesting GaN HEMTs With Multiple Degradation Mechanisms","sourcePdf":"tdmr-paine-2474359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131849S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7298","isNumber":"7339738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7298","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7339738","articleId":"7229312","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7229313,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology","School of Computer Science and Engineering, The University of Aizu, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245519/9109589/7229313/li-2474385-small.gif","p":["Peng Li (S'10-M'12) received the BS degree from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China, in 2007, the MS and PhD degrees from the University of Aizu, Japan, in 2009 and 2012, respectively.

In this paper, we consider a geo-distributed cloud architecture that provides MapReduce services based on the big data collected from end users all over the world. Existing work handles MapReduce jobs by a traditional computation-centric approach that all input data distributed in multiple clouds are aggregated to a virtual cluster that resides in a single cloud. Its poor efficiency and high cost for big data support motivate us to propose a novel data-centric architecture with three key techniques, namely, cross-cloud virtual cluster, data-centric job placement, and network coding based traffic routing. Our design leads to an optimization framework with the objective of minimizing both computation and transmission cost for running a set of MapReduce jobs in geo-distributed clouds. We further design a parallel algorithm by decomposing the original large-scale problem into several distributively solvable subproblems that are coordinated by a high-level master problem. Finally, we conduct real-world experiments and extensive simulations to show that our proposal significantly outperforms the existing works.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2474385","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2474385","startPage":"375","endPage":"386","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/9109589/07229313.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=9109589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Cloud MapReduce for Big Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229313/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April-June 1 2020","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Cloud MapReduce for Big Data","volume":"8","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 June 2020","accessionNumber":"19670590","publicationDate":"1 April-June 2020","htmlLink":"/document/7229313/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100009036","fundingName":"Strategic International Collaborative Research Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Cloud MapReduce for Big Data","sourcePdf":"tcc-li-2474385-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.185034S","chronDate":"April-June 1 2020","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"9109589","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"9109589","articleId":"7229313","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2020","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7229315,"authors":[{"name":"Zhong-lai Huang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Submarine Geosciences and Prospecting Techniques, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7386543/7229315/huang-2466660-small.gif","p":["\n\nZhong-lai Huang received the B.E. degree from the Hefei University of \nTechnology, Hefei, China, in 2004, the M.S. degree from the Guizhou University, Guiyang, China, in 2008, and the Ph.D. \ndegree from the Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2013.","Now he is working as an Assistant Professor at the Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China.

By synchrosqueezing and reassigning the T-F spectrum of the wavelet transform (WT) or the short time Fourier transform (STFT) of a signal, the SST can obtain a high-resolution T-F spectrum. In the light of the superiority of S-transform (ST) over the WT and the STFT, especially, in representing a high-frequency weak-amplitude signal on its T-F spectrum, we propose a synchrosqueezing S-transform (SSST) which is realized by synchrosqueezing the spectrum of the ST. The formulas for the SSST and its inverse transform are derived. Synthetic examples show that the SSST has obviously higher resolution than the ST, and is superior to the SST like the ST to the WT. We then applied the SSST to perform the spectral decomposition of a marine seismic data for natural gas hydrate exploration. The results illustrate that the SSST can be used to well detect frequency spectral anomalies correlated with the gas hydrate and free-gas accumulations. We can also conclude that the SSST is a good potential technique to assist seismic interpretation.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2015.2466660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7386543/07229315.pdf","startPage":"817","endPage":"825","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2015.2466660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7386543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchrosqueezing S-Transform and Its Application in Seismic Spectral Decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229315","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229315/","displayDocTitle":"Synchrosqueezing S-Transform and Its Application in Seismic Spectral Decomposition","volume":"54","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15720444","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229315/","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41074077 and 41230318"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100013286","fundingName":"Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20130132110023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"201413004"},{"fundingName":"Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation, China","grantNumber":"ZR2014DP001"},{"fundingName":"National Marine Geology Special Projects"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchrosqueezing S-Transform and Its Application in Seismic Spectral Decomposition","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2466660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097411S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7386543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"7386543","articleId":"7229315","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7229318,"authors":[{"name":"Abhijit Choudhury","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7384815/7229318/choud-2474307-small.gif","p":["Abhijit Choudhury (S'11) received the B.E. degree from the National Institute of Technology Agartala, Agartala, India, in 2007, the M.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree from Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2015.","From 2007 to 2008, he was a Management Trainee with ABB, Vadodara, India, and from September 2011 to December 2011, he was a Graduate Trainee with General Motors, Bangalore, India.

A maximum value of power factor is numerically derived, above which it affects the capacitor voltage balancing capability. Compared with the previously presented research work, the inputs to the space-vector pulsewidth-modulation block are the three phase currents and the difference between the two capacitor voltages. Depending on the states of the two dc-link capacitor voltages and phase current direction, redundant voltage vector sequences are selected. The selected vectors keep the capacitor voltage deviations within 5% of the total dc-link voltage. Two zero switching vectors (i.e., PPP and NNN) are also removed from all subsectors of the earlier proposed strategy, which one used to produce higher common-mode voltages.

Thus, meeting the QoS requirements of so many diverse applications in such shared resource environments has become a real challenge, especially since the characteristics and workload of applications differ widely and may change over time. This paper presents an experimental system that can exploit a variety of online QoS aware adaptive task allocation schemes, and three such schemes are designed and compared. These are a measurement driven algorithm that uses reinforcement learning, secondly a \u201csensible\u201d allocation algorithm that assigns tasks to sub-systems that are observed to provide a lower response time, and then an algorithm that splits the task arrival stream into sub-streams at rates computed from the hosts' processing capabilities. All of these schemes are compared via measurements among themselves and with a simple round-robin scheduler, on two experimental test-beds with homogenous and heterogenous hosts having different processing capacities.","doi":"10.1109/TCC.2015.2474406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245519/8307205/07229325.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCC.2015.2474406","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8307205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Dispatching of Tasks in the Cloud","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229325","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229325/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Dispatching of Tasks in the Cloud","volume":"6","issue":"1","publicationDate":"1 Jan.-March 2018","accessionNumber":"17633488","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229325/","dateOfInsertion":"06 March 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Adaptive Dispatching of Tasks in the Cloud","sourcePdf":"tcc-gelenbe-2474406-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09718S","chronDate":"Jan.-March 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245519","isNumber":"8307205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245519","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8307205","articleId":"7229325","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229329,"authors":[{"name":"Tong-Xing Zheng","affiliation":["MOE Key Laboratory for Intelligent Networks and Network Security, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7229329/zheng-2474390_print-small.gif","p":["\nTong-Xing Zheng (S'14) received the B.S. degree from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China, in 2010, where he is pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

We provide a comprehensive secrecy performance analysis and system design/optimization under a stochastic geometry framework. Specifically, we first evaluate the secrecy outage performance, and derive a closed-form expression for the optimal power allocation ratio of the information signal power to the total transmit power that minimizes the secrecy outage probability (SOP). Subject to a SOP constraint, we then propose a dynamic parameter transmission scheme (DPTS) and a static parameter transmission scheme (SPTS) to maximize secrecy throughput, and provide explicit solutions on the optimal transmission parameters, including the wiretap code rates, the on-off transmission threshold and the power allocation ratio. Our results give new insight into secure transmission designs. For example, secrecy rate is a concave function of the power allocation ratio in DPTS, and AN plays a significant role under SOP constraints and in dense eavesdropper scenarios. In SPTS, transmission probability is a concave function of the power allocation ratio, and secrecy throughput is a quasi-concave function of the secrecy rate. Numerical results are demonstrated to validate our theoretical analysis.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2474390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7328780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2474390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7328780/07229329.pdf","startPage":"4347","endPage":"4362","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Antenna Transmission With Artificial Noise Against Randomly Distributed Eavesdroppers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Antenna Transmission With Artificial Noise Against Randomly Distributed Eavesdroppers","volume":"63","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229329/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15676752","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229329/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61102081 and 61221063"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for the Author of National Excellent Doctoral Dissertation of China","grantNumber":"201340"},{"fundingName":"National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2015AA011306"},{"fundingName":"New Century Excellent Talents Support Fund of China","grantNumber":"NCET-13-0458"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004806","fundingName":"Fok Ying Tong Education Foundation","grantNumber":"141063"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central University","grantNumber":"2013jdgz11"},{"fundingName":"MEST","grantNumber":"2015R1A2A1A05000977"},{"fundingName":"NRF, Korea"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Antenna Transmission With Artificial Noise Against Randomly Distributed Eavesdroppers","sourcePdf":"tcomm-zheng-2474390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.205039S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7229329","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7229332,"authors":[{"name":"Il Yong Chun","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Il Yong","lastName":"Chun","id":"37085703545"},{"name":"Ben Adcock","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Ben","lastName":"Adcock","id":"37085338530"},{"name":"Thomas M.

However, the performance of CS reconstruction models in pMRI has not been fully maximized, and CS recovery guarantees for pMRI are largely absent. To improve reconstruction accuracy from parsimonious amounts of k-space data while maintaining flexibility, a new CS SENSitivity Encoding (SENSE) pMRI reconstruction framework promoting joint sparsity (JS) across channels (JS CS SENSE) is proposed in this paper. The recovery guarantee derived for the proposed JS CS SENSE model is demonstrated to be better than that of the conventional CS SENSE model and similar to that of the coil-by-coil CS model. The flexibility of the new model is better than the coil-by-coil CS model and the same as that of CS SENSE. For fast image reconstruction and fair comparisons, all the introduced CS-based constrained optimization problems are solved with split Bregman, variable splitting, and combined-variable splitting techniques. For the JS CS SENSE model in particular, these techniques lead to an efficient algorithm. Numerical experiments show that the reconstruction accuracy is significantly improved by JS CS SENSE compared with the conventional CS SENSE. In addition, an accurate residual-JS regularized sensitivity estimation model is also proposed and extended to calibration-less (CaL) JS CS SENSE. Numerical results show that CaL JS CS SENSE outperforms other state-of-the-art CS-based calibration-less methods in particular for reconstructing non-piecewise constant images.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2015.2474383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel7/42/7368217/07229332.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2015.2474383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7368217","startPage":"354","endPage":"368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Compressed Sensing SENSE pMRI Reconstruction With Joint Sparsity Promotion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229332","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Compressed Sensing SENSE pMRI Reconstruction With Joint Sparsity Promotion","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229332/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"35","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685089","pubMedId":"26336120","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7229332/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000121","fundingName":"Division of Mathematical Sciences","grantNumber":"1318894"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006977","fundingName":"Indiana State Department of Health","grantNumber":"Health Spinal Cord and Brain Injury Research Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Compressed Sensing SENSE pMRI Reconstruction With Joint Sparsity Promotion","sourcePdf":"tmi-chun-2474383-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.187206S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7368217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7368217","articleId":"7229332","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229342,"authors":[{"name":"Alonso Hernan Ricci Castro","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering of Guaratingueta, Sao Paulo State University, Guaratingueta, Brazil"],"firstName":"Alonso Hernan Ricci","lastName":"Castro","id":"37085723315"},{"name":"Konstantin Georgiev Kostov","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering of Guaratingueta, Sao Paulo State University, Guaratingueta, Brazil"],"firstName":"Konstantin Georgiev","lastName":"Kostov","id":"37283012000"},{"name":"Vadym Prysiazhnyi","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Chemistry, Faculty of Engineering of Guaratingueta, Sao Paulo State University, Guaratingueta, Brazil"],"firstName":"Vadym","lastName":"Prysiazhnyi","id":"37085460298"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0093-3813"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9375"}],"articleNumber":"7229342","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Plasmas","Substrates","Electron tubes","Surface treatment","Geometry","Shape","Glass"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["argon","gas mixtures","nozzles","plasma jets","plasma materials processing","plasma transport processes","surface treatment","wetting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nozzle shape","low-power Ar plasma jet","nozzle geometry","atmospheric pressure plasma jet","tapered nozzle","thin plasma plume","straight nozzle","enlarged nozzle","active plasma area","surface modification","wettability","image analysis","light emission","nozzle diameter","plasma spreading","carrier gas-ambient air mixture","electrical properties","Ar"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Jet geometry","plasma jet","power measurements."]},{"kwd":["Jet geometry","plasma jet","power measurements"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229342","abstract":"The influence of nozzle geometry on the properties of atmospheric-pressure Ar plasma jet was investigated.

The electrical properties and visual appearance of the generated plasma were studied with these three nozzles. The jet's performance for surface modification was evaluated by measuring the area of the samples with enhanced wettability and comparing it with the image analysis of the light emission over the sample surface. It has been concluded that limiting the nozzle diameter can be a solution to reduce the treatment area. However, the decrease in the treated area is limited due to the plasma spreading. The use of widen nozzle leads to increase in the treated area and possibility to control the mixture of the carrier gas with ambient air, making this nozzle configuration potentially interesting for other applications, as, for example, treatment of small 3-D objects.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7247788","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/27/7247788/07229342.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2015.2463072","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2015.2463072","startPage":"3228","endPage":"3233","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of Nozzle Shape on the Performance of Low-Power Ar Plasma Jet","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229342/","displayDocTitle":"Influence of Nozzle Shape on the Performance of Low-Power Ar Plasma Jet","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229342/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"43","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"15433047","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001807","fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Amparo \u00e0 Pesquisa do Estado de S\u00e3o Paulo","grantNumber":"2013/06732-3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico","grantNumber":"470995/2013-0"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of Nozzle Shape on the Performance of Low-Power Ar Plasma Jet","sourcePdf":"tps-prysiazhnyi-2463072-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078515S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"7247788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7247788","articleId":"7229342","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7229343,"authors":[{"name":"Liusha Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7323913/7229343/7229343-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liusha Yang received the B.S. degree in communication engineering from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2012.","Currently, she is pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

The performance of the optimized portfolio relies on the accuracy of the estimated covariance matrix of the portfolio asset returns. For large portfolios, the number of available market returns is often of similar order to the number of assets, so that the sample covariance matrix performs poorly as a covariance estimator. Additionally, financial market data often contain outliers which, if not correctly handled, may further corrupt the covariance estimation. We address these shortcomings by studying the performance of a hybrid covariance matrix estimator based on Tyler's robust M-estimator and on Ledoit-Wolf's shrinkage estimator while assuming samples with heavy-tailed distribution. Employing recent results from random matrix theory, we develop a consistent estimator of (a scaled version of) the realized portfolio risk, which is minimized by optimizing online the shrinkage intensity. Our portfolio optimization method is shown via simulations to outperform existing methods both for synthetic and real market data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229343/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"63","issue":"24","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2015","dateOfInsertion":"18 November 2015","accessionNumber":"15598189","htmlLink":"/document/7229343/","displayDocTitle":"A Robust Statistics Approach to Minimum Variance Portfolio Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grants Council","grantNumber":"16206914"},{"fundingName":"ERC MORE EC","grantNumber":"120133"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Robust Statistics Approach to Minimum Variance Portfolio Optimization","sourcePdf":"tsp-yang-2474298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101116S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7323913","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7323913","articleId":"7229343","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7229346,"authors":[{"name":"Sai Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7343816/7229346/7229346-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sai Jin received the B.E. degree from Shandong University, China, in 2010.

An NN communicates with the base station (BS) directly while an FN communicates indirectly via the assistance of NNs. We study the design and analysis issues for PTWR-OFDMA. The proposed scheme has some noticeable advantages. First, the throughput of PTWR-OFDMA increases like lnK, much higher than that of lnlnK in conventional OFDMA ( K is the number of MTs). Second, PTWR-OFDMA can provide much better fairness than conventional OFDMA. Third, the power overhead per NN reduces quickly when K increases if there is a peak rate limitation, implying that there is no strong incentive for some users to avoid providing relaying.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7343816/07229346.pdf","startPage":"48","endPage":"59","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2015.2474308","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2015.2474308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7343816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Two-Way Relaying in Cooperative OFDMA Cellular Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimized production technology","Resource management","Fading","Relays","Artificial neural networks","Approximation methods","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cooperative communication","frequency division multiple access","network coding","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative OFDMA cellular system","base station","far-nodes","near-nodes","mobile terminal","analog network coding","PTWR-OFDMA scheme","parallel two-way relaying orthogonal frequency division multiple access scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Analog network coding","cooperative communication","OFDMA","two-way relaying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229346/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Two-Way Relaying in Cooperative OFDMA Cellular Systems","volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7229346/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15647659","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Two-Way Relaying in Cooperative OFDMA Cellular Systems","sourcePdf":"tsp-jin-2474308-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131513S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7343816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7343816","articleId":"7229346","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229347,"authors":[{"name":"Jos\u00e9 Francisco de Andrade","affiliation":["Program of Electrical Engineering (PEE), Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ)","ET-PROSUB Marine Bresilienne (Brazilian Navy Technical Office in France), HOUILLES, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7323913/7229347/7229347-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jos\u00e9 Francisco de Andrade, Jr., was born in Natal, Brazil, in 1969.

We consider a two-phase communication protocol with fixed-rate transmission. In the first phase, wireless power transfer is conducted from the source to the jammer. In the second phase, the source transmits the information-bearing signal under the protection of a jamming signal sent by the jammer using the harvested energy in the first phase. We analytically characterize the long-term behavior of the proposed protocol and derive a closed-form expression for the throughput. We further optimize the rate parameters for maximizing the throughput subject to a secrecy outage probability constraint. Our analytical results show that the throughput performance differs significantly between the single-antenna jammer case and the multiantenna jammer case. For instance, as the source transmit power increases, the throughput quickly reaches an upper bound with single-antenna jammer, while the throughput grows unbounded with multiantenna jammer. Our numerical results also validate the derived analytical results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229350/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","volume":"15","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15697433","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7229350/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Secure Communication With a Wireless-Powered Friendly Jammer","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Project Funding Scheme","grantNumber":"DP150103905"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure Communication With a Wireless-Powered Friendly Jammer","sourcePdf":"twc-liu-2474378-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151624S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7229350","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7229353,"authors":[{"name":"Saishankar Katri Pulliyakode","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, Chennai, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7229353/pulli-2474399-small.gif","p":["Saishankar Katri Pulliyakode received the B.E. degree in electronics and communication engineering from Madras Institute of Technology, Chennai, India, in 2009.

The eNodeB obtains this rate information as a quantized feedback from the TIE at time n and uses this for rate selection until the next feedback is received at time n + \u03b4. The feedback received at n can become outdated before n + \u03b4, because of 1) Doppler fading, and 2) change in the set of active interferers for a TIE. Therefore, rate prediction becomes essential. Since the rates belong to a discrete set, we propose a discrete sequence prediction approach, wherein, frequency trees for the discrete sequences are built using source encoding algorithms like prediction by partial match (PPM). Finding the optimal depth of the frequency tree used for prediction is cast as a model order selection problem. The rate sequence complexity is analyzed to provide an upper bound on model order. Information-theoretic criteria are then used to solve the model order problem. Finally, two prediction algorithms are proposed, using the PPM with optimal model order and system level simulations demonstrate the improvement in packet loss and throughput due to these algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2474399","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07229353.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2474399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"416","endPage":"429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Prediction and Selection in LTE Systems Using Modified Source Encoding Techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Rate Prediction and Selection in LTE Systems Using Modified Source Encoding Techniques","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229353/","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7229353/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15697412","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100006143","fundingName":"Department of Science and Technology (DST) India"},{"fundingName":"Indo-UK Advanced Technology Centre (IU-ATC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Prediction and Selection in LTE Systems Using Modified Source Encoding Techniques","sourcePdf":"twc-pulliyakode-2474399-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083938S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7229353","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229360,"authors":[{"name":"Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, The University of Adelaide, SA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/34/7464929/7229360/palsi-2474388-small.gif","p":["Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai received the bachelor degree in computer\n engineering, the master degree in biomedical engineering, and the PhD degree from the University of New South Wales,\n Sydney, Australia, in 2003 and 2010, respectively.

In this situation the performance of a detector should be assessed on the basis of the area under the ROC curve over that range, rather than over the full curve, as the performance outside the prescribed range is irrelevant. This measure is labelled as the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC). We propose a novel ensemble learning method which achieves a maximal detection rate at a user-defined range of false positive rates by directly optimizing the partial AUC using structured learning. In addition, in order to achieve high object detection performance, we propose a new approach to extracting low-level visual features based on spatial pooling. Incorporating spatial pooling improves the translational invariance and thus the robustness of the detection process. Experimental results on both synthetic and realworld data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we show that it is possible to train state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors using the proposed structured ensemble learning method with spatially pooled features. The result is the current best reported performance on the Caltech-USA pedestrian detection dataset.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pedestrian Detection with Spatially Pooled Features and Structured Ensemble Learning","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2474388","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7464929/07229360.pdf","startPage":"1243","endPage":"1257","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2015.2474388","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7464929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229360/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"28 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Pedestrian Detection with Spatially Pooled Features and Structured Ensemble Learning","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"38","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7229360/","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2016","publicationDate":"1 June 2016","accessionNumber":"16023291","pubMedId":"26336118","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Data to Decisions CRC Centre"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pedestrian Detection with Spatially Pooled Features and Structured Ensemble Learning","sourcePdf":"tpami-shen-2474388-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.213152S","chronDate":"June 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7464929","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7464929","articleId":"7229360","onlineDate":"28 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7229374,"authors":[{"name":"Simran Singh","affiliation":["Airbus Defence, Ulm, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7229369/7229374/7229374-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Simran Singh received his Dipl.-Ing.

Stemming from the established mirror-frequency crosstalk nature of the different mismatch spurs, the interleaving mismatch identification process is then carried out using complex second-order statistics based methods. The developed learning algorithm performs the mismatch identification and learns the mismatch compensation filter parameters in a blind manner for almost the full digital bandwidth of the 4 TI-ADC system.

A novel consensus protocol is proposed based on continuous information of each agent itself and sampled information of each agent's neighbors. By using nonnegative matrix theory and graph theory, we prove that the consensus problem is solvable in the asynchronous sampled-data setting without or with time-varying communication delays, if the union of the effective communication topology across any time interval with some given length contains a spanning tree.

The proposed two-step SS ADC circuit does not utilize an analog memory capacitor to store the value of the first ramp step. Instead, to handle problems such as the slope errors of the second ramp and the stored charge error from charge feed-through, it utilizes a very simple digital column circuit consisting of a coarse counter (coarse step counter) and a 4-to-16 decoder. The second ramp (fine ramp) slope has only one slope generator, regardless of the results of the first ramp decisions, to eliminate the slope mismatch between fine ramp slopes. A prototype sensor comprising 640 \u00d7 480 pixels was fabricated with a 0.13- \u03bcm CMOS process. The results of experiments conducted indicate that the proposed ADC can achieve a conversion time of 6.4 \u03bcs at a main clock frequency of 62.5 MHz, which is 10.2 times faster than the conventional SS ADC. The maximum frame rate of the proposed VGA CMOS Image Sensor (CIS) is 320 frames per second (fps). Further, the proposed circuit employs redundancy error correction logic to calibrate the error between the coarse and fine steps. The total power consumption is 72 mW from supply voltages of 2.8 V (analog) and 1.5 V (digital). The figure of merit (FoM) of the proposed VGA CMOS image sensor is 2.01 [e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-</sup>\n nJ].","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229383/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","volume":"62","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15414091","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7229383/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"High Frame-Rate VGA CMOS Image Sensor Using Non-Memory Capacitor Two-Step Single-Slope ADCs","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003665","fundingName":"National IT Industry Promotion Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Frame-Rate VGA CMOS Image Sensor Using Non-Memory Capacitor Two-Step Single-Slope ADCs","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lee-2451791-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105377S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7229369","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7229369","articleId":"7229383","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7229386,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Maffezzoni","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7229369/7229386/7229386-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Paolo Maffezzoni (M'08\u2013SM'15) holds a MS degree in electronic engineering and a Ph.D. degree in electronic instrumentation.

The effectiveness of the proposed method is reflected on the rounding off of control variables to the nearest integer or nearest available discrete values. With the implementation of the solution obtained in real time applications, the system becomes less prone to voltage instability. In this paper, DEPSO is applied to standard IEEE 30-bus test system.

The described system for the characterization of disturbances is based on wavelet based feature extraction. The amount of data to be analyzed and how the data can be interpreted are of crucial importance in power quality analysis. Wavelet Transform(WT) has been widely used in power quality signal analysis. The advantage of wavelet transform is it can provide precise time information of power quality events and has many advantages over traditional signal analysis approaches. In this paper Discrete Wavelet Transform(DWT) is used for obtaining the energy distribution from simulated signals.

Demand response relies on scheduling of loads under the constraints enforced by the utlity so as to reduce energy cost. Schedulable loads play an important role in such programs. The main aim of Demand Response programs is to minimize the energy cost considering the Maximum Demand (MD) limit and the operating constraints of the demand resources. Binary Particle Swarm Optimization(BPSO) is one of the soft computing methods suitable for addressing commitment problems. This paper suggests a method based on BPSO to solve the load scheduling problem with flexibe and non flexible loads and also having Maximum Demand constraint.

To improve the control of it, different pulse width modulation techniques like sine triangle PWM, space vector modulation etc are used. Conventional space vector PWM employs switching sequence, which divides the zero vector time equally between the two zero states in every subcycle. Bus-clamping PWM employ clamping sequences, use only one zero state and results in clamping of one phase during the entire duration in a subcycle. Bus clamping technique reduces the switching losses and improves the efficiency and performance of the inverter. The THD has been reduced and output voltage is improved.

Cloud computing plays a major role to figure out these complicated problems. Cloud computing is generally categorized into computation intensive and storage intensive model. Cloud collects congregate myriad number of requests from the user (i.e. treated as batch jobs). Hence, scheduling algorithm plays a major role for effectively scheduling of the jobs to the underlying resources scattered in and around the universe. The resources are linked through high speed network. This paper posits Minimum Variation First algorithm (MVF) for effective scheduling of batch jobs. The difference between the expected execution time on the job and its corresponding deadline is recognized as a necessary parameter for allocating the resource for a job. The involvement of this paper is considered as twofold. First, the deadline based jobs are scheduled using the proposed MVF algorithm that will schedule with uniform and non-uniform deadline based jobs. Second, the jobs are scheduled using improved MVF (iMVF) algorithm for avoiding starvation. The experimental results show the performance of these algorithms (MVF and iMVF algorithm) is better compared to other algorithms using CloudSim.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Job scheduling using Minimum Variation First algorithm in cloud computing","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC)","doi":"10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229708","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203815/7229701/07229708.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"198","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229708","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229701","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229708/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Job scheduling using Minimum Variation First algorithm in cloud computing","conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229708/","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"15415946","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Job scheduling using Minimum Variation First algorithm in cloud computing","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"138icoac14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052429S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7203815","isNumber":"7229701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203815","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7229701","articleId":"7229708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7229718,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Right from small and medium sized businesses and large scale businesses and even a single individual start utilizing cloud for their demands in terms of storage, software as well as infrastructure elastically and pay on use basis. But this transition to the cloud poses many security issues. One predominant issue is data security breach at many levels. Traditional cryptographic techniques and access control models like Mandatory, Discretionary and Role Based Access Control models are ill-suited for addressing multifarious security breaches in the cloud. This paper proposes dynamic access control for securing data in the cloud.

Mostly DSP applications deplete power. Battery constraint is important in many mobiles, processors, and sensor-related devices. The major critical operations in DSP architecture are multiplication and addition. Multiplication process is performed using repetitive addition. Hence, adder is the basic component used in digital signal processor. DSP architecture is proposed with the energy-efficient goal. Traditional carry select adder contains ripple carry adder block is replaced by parallel prefix adder. By replacing that block and introducing folded tree, we can reduce power used by DSP processors. This architecture can be used in all power constrained DSP applications. In the existing system, folded tree is used in architecture to reduce the number of processing elements, and they used carry look-ahead adder to perform the internal processing element operations. In the proposed system, carry look-ahead adder is replaced by LFA and PA to harness the energy depleted in an application (e.g., DSP application). Power consumption is reduced by 12-15% as compared with the existing algorithms using Cyclone III (EP3C16F484C6).","doi":"10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229757","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth International Conference on Advanced Computing (ICoAC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7203815/7229701/07229757.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICoAC.2014.7229757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229701","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DSP architecture with folded tree for power constraint devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Dec. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Dec. 2014","displayDocTitle":"DSP architecture with folded tree for power constraint devices","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7229757/","accessionNumber":"15416006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSP architecture with folded tree for power constraint devices","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"70icoac14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050651S","chronDate":"17-19 Dec. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"7203815","isNumber":"7229701","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7203815","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7229701","articleId":"7229757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7229820,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Lacruche","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Lacruche","id":"37085759676"},{"name":"Nicolas Borrel","affiliation":["ST Microelectronics"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Borrel","id":"37085434819"},{"name":"Clement Champeix","affiliation":["ST Microelectronics","\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne"],"firstName":"Clement","lastName":"Champeix","id":"37085429593"},{"name":"Cyril Roscian","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne"],"firstName":"Cyril","lastName":"Roscian","id":"37072803900"},{"name":"Alexandre Sarafianos","affiliation":["ST Microelectronics"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Sarafianos","id":"38486579200"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Rigaud","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Mines de Saint-\u00e9tienne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Baptiste","lastName":"Rigaud"},{"name":"Jean-Max Dutertre","affiliation":["\u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Mines de Saint-\u00e9tienne, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Max","lastName":"Dutertre"},{"name":"Edith Kussener","affiliation":["Institut des Materiaux de Microelectronique et des Nanosciences de Provence, Marseille, Provence-Alpes-C\u00c3\u00b4te d'Azu, FR"],"firstName":"Edith","lastName":"Kussener"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7905-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7904-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"7229820","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SRAM cells","Transistors","Circuit faults","Inverters","Photoconductivity","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit layout","laser beam effects","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["laser fault injection","SRAM cell","picosecond versus nanosecond pulses","fault attack","cell layout","short laser pulse","laser sensitive areas","time 30 ps"]}],"abstract":"Laser fault injection into SRAM cells is a widely used technique to perform fault attacks.

Spanning the entire chip, the NoC suffers from both inter-die and intra-die variations. In addition to static variability, the NoC is also afflected by dynamic variations, such as fast VDD droops, temperature, and aging effects. Such variations cause unpredictable behavior in the timing characteristics of the NoC components, which need significant timing margins to ensure always-correct operation. Consequently, the potential for high-frequency operation is impeded. In this paper, we propose a timing-error-resilient mechanism called TRNoC, which allows the NoC to operate at higher frequencies, at the expense of sporadically experiencing run-time timing errors, which are handled by an error recovery strategy. TRNoC includes a lightweight timing-error detection mechanism, together with a distributed error recovery mechanism, which allow for lossless operation, while leaving the error-free parts of the network unaffected. Hardware implementation results demonstrate the efficiency of TRNoC and its potential as a scalable timing-error-resilient NoC architecture.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7217973/7229816/07229836.pdf","startPage":"77","endPage":"82","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing-resilient Network-on-Chip architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Clocks","Registers","Ports (Computers)","Switches","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing-resilient network-on-chip architectures","on-chip communication","multicore systems","many-core systems","inter-die variation","intra-die variation","static variability","dynamic variations","fast VDD droops","aging effects","timing characteristics","always-correct operation","high-frequency operation","timing-error-resilient mechanism","TRNoC","run-time timing errors","error recovery strategy","lightweight timing-error detection mechanism","distributed error recovery mechanism","lossless operation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Timing-resilient Network-on-Chip architectures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229836/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417160","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing-resilient Network-on-Chip architectures","confLoc":"Halkidiki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP01942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051846S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7217973","isNumber":"7229816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7217973","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7229816","articleId":"7229836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7229839,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Sch\u00f6ll","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Architecture and Computer Engineering, University of Stuttgart Pfaffenwaldring 47, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Sch\u00f6ll","id":"38541323900"},{"name":"Claus Braun","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Architecture and Computer Engineering, University of Stuttgart Pfaffenwaldring 47, Germany"],"firstName":"Claus","lastName":"Braun","id":"37532374200"},{"name":"Michael A.

However, such nano-scaled CMOS devices face an increasing number of reliability threats, which make the integration of fault tolerance mandatory. The preconditioned conjugate gradient method (PCG) is a very popular solver since it typically finds solutions faster than direct methods, and it is less vulnerable to transient effects. However, as latest research shows, the vulnerability is still considerable. Even single errors caused, for instance, by marginal hardware, harsh operating conditions or particle radiation can increase execution times considerably or corrupt solutions without indication. In this work, a novel and highly efficient fault-tolerant PCG method is presented. The method applies only two inner products to reliably detect errors. In case of errors, the method automatically selects between roll-back and efficient on-line correction. This significantly reduces the error detection overhead and expensive re-computations.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Error correction","Sparse matrices","Approximation methods","Gradient methods","Approximation algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","conjugate gradient methods","fault simulation","nanoelectronics","radiation hardening (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["on-line fault-tolerance","preconditioned conjugate gradient method","linear system solvers","modern heterogeneous computer architectures","nanoscaled CMOS devices","reliability threats","fault tolerance mandatory","transient effects","single errors","harsh operating conditions","particle radiation","execution times","fault-tolerant PCG method","error detection overhead"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sparse Linear System Solving","Fault Tolerance","Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient","ABFT"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229839","startPage":"95","endPage":"100","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7217973/7229816/07229839.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient on-line fault-tolerance for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient on-line fault-tolerance for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15417192","publicationDate":"July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7229839/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229839/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient on-line fault-tolerance for the preconditioned conjugate gradient method","confLoc":"Halkidiki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP02252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093663S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7217973","isNumber":"7229816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7217973","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7229816","articleId":"7229839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7229850,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Ye","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Institute of Computing Technology CAS, Beijing, P.

The arbiter PUF is a typical kind of strong PUF. However, due to its deterministic logic, attackers can use modeling techniques to break it in short time. Therefore, this paper proposes an Obfuscation logic based PUF (OPUF) design. A Boolean obfuscation module is proposed to obfuscate the logic which is employed to select the path segments in the arbiter PUF. In this way, the nondeterminacy of PUF is improved, and the computation complexities of modeling attacks are significantly increased, making the OPUF much safer against modeling attack. Both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results show the proposed OPUF design has good stability and randomness.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7217973/7229816/07229850.pdf","startPage":"156","endPage":"161","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OPUF: Obfuscation logic based physical unclonable function","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Stability analysis","Delays","Manufacturing","Complexity theory","SRAM cells","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","Boolean algebra","computational complexity","security of data","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["obfuscation logic based physical unclonable function","hardware security","deterministic logic","modeling techniques","obfuscation logic based PUF design","OPUF design","Boolean obfuscation module","computation complexities","modeling attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Unclonable Function","Obfuscation","Arbiter PUF","SRAM PUF","Modeling Attack"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229850/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"OPUF: Obfuscation logic based physical unclonable function","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229850/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417156","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OPUF: Obfuscation logic based physical unclonable function","confLoc":"Halkidiki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP03382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04709S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7217973","isNumber":"7229816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7217973","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7229816","articleId":"7229850","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7229858,"authors":[{"name":"Daniele Rossi","affiliation":["ECS, University of Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37085360127"},{"name":"Vasileios Tenentes","affiliation":["ECS, University of Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Vasileios","lastName":"Tenentes","id":"37393972000"},{"name":"Saqib Khursheed","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering & Electronics, University of Liverpool, UK"],"firstName":"Saqib","lastName":"Khursheed","id":"38286610400"},{"name":"Bashir M.

First, we demonstrate that, as memories age, leakage power reduction techniques become more effective due to sub-threshold current reduction with aging. Then, we provide an analytical model and a design exploration framework to evaluate trade-offs between leakage power and reliability, and propose a BTI and leakage aware selection of the \u201cdrowsy\u201d state retention voltage for DVS of cache memories. We propose three DVS policies, allowing us to achieve different power/reliability trade-offs. Through SPICE simulations, we show that a critical charge and a static noise margin increase up to 150% and 34.7%, respectively, is achieved compared to standard aging unaware drowsy technique, with a limited leakage power increase during the very early lifetime, and with leakage energy saving up to 37% in 10 years of operation. These improvements are attained at zero or negligible area cost.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229858","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7217973/7229816/07229858.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BTI and leakage aware dynamic voltage scaling for reliable low power cache memories","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229858","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229858/","displayDocTitle":"BTI and leakage aware dynamic voltage scaling for reliable low power cache memories","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417167","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229858/","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BTI and leakage aware dynamic voltage scaling for reliable low power cache memories","confLoc":"Halkidiki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP041101.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116738S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7217973","isNumber":"7229816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7217973","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7229816","articleId":"7229858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7229859,"authors":[{"name":"Lake Bu","affiliation":["Boston University, Boston, MA, US"],"firstName":"Lake","lastName":"Bu"},{"name":"Mark Karpovsky","affiliation":["Reliable Computing Laboratory, Boston University, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Karpovsky","id":"37085684609"},{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["MathWorks, Boston, USA"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085685399"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7905-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7904-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1942-9398"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1942-9401"}],"articleNumber":"7229859","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7229859","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Decision support systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","cache storage","circuit complexity","error correction codes","error detection codes","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["byte error correcting code","reliable cache design","bit level error detection","bit level error correction","group testing based error correcting code","memory protection","non-binary GTB codes","binary superimposed codes","binary matrices","decoding complexity reduction","codewords"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["error correction codes","fault tolerance","cache","superimposed codes","encoding","decoding"]}],"abstract":"Most cache designs support single or double bit-level error detection and correction in cache lines. However, a single error may distort a whole byte or even more, resulting in much higher decoding complexity than that of bit-level distortions. Thereby this paper proposes a new group testing based error correcting code (GTB code) for byte-level error locating and correcting which provides much stronger protection for memories. This new class of non-binary GTB codes is generated from binary superimposed codes. Since it is encoded and decoded by binary matrices, no complicated Galois Field computations in GF(Q) such as multiplications and inversions are involved. Comparing with popular non-binary error correcting codes (ECC) such as Hamming, Reed-Solomon and interleaved codes, the GTB codes achieves up to 42% reduction of the decoding complexity (hardware cost \u00d7 latency) for single-byte error correction, and up to 98% reduction for double-byte error correction. Moreover, given the length of codewords (e.g. 512 bits for cache lines), as the size of each Q-ary digit (byte) increases, the saving increases.","doi":"10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IOLTS.2015.7229859","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 21st International On-Line Testing Symposium (IOLTS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7217973/7229816/07229859.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"205","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7229816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New byte error correcting codes with simple decoding for reliable cache design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7229859/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New byte error correcting codes with simple decoding for reliable cache design","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15417171","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7229859/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New byte error correcting codes with simple decoding for reliable cache design","confLoc":"Halkidiki, Greece","sourcePdf":"RP042102.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0744S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7217973","isNumber":"7229816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7217973","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7229816","articleId":"7229859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"}]
