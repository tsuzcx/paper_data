Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) are two different modes of communication in a vehicular network. Some measurement studies have previously been undertaken to understand the feasibility of using WiFi for V2V and V2I communication. Recently WiMAX is emerging as one of the possible candidates for next generation mobile networks. In this work, we set out to understand the feasibility of using WiMAX for V2I communication as compared to the use of WiFi. Due to the hardware limitation, we focus on a static setting in urban environment. Our initial measurement studies show that while WiMAX can offer a longer communication range than WiFi, its latency can be significantly larger than that of WiFi at a short distance (e.g. less than 100 m). In addition, we show the setting of frame size has a strong impact on the performance of WiMAX.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["WiMAX","Mobile communication","Road vehicles","Delay","Throughput","Loss measurement","Portable computers","Next generation networking","Base stations","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile communication","road vehicles","WiMax","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle-to-infrastructure communication","WiFi","WiMAX","vehicular network","wireless mobile network","vehicle-to-vehicle communication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5088977","doi":"10.1109/MDM.2009.127","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware","pdfPath":"/iel5/5088898/5088899/05088977.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDM.2009.127","startPage":"397","endPage":"398","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5088899","publicationTitle":"2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Feasibility Study on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication: WiFi vs. WiMAX","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Feasibility Study on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication: WiFi vs. WiMAX","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5088977/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5088977/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10720477","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Feasibility Study on Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communication: WiFi vs. WiMAX","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3650a397.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051716S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5088898","isNumber":"5088899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5088898","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5088899","articleId":"5088977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5088987,"authors":[{"name":"Jenhui Chen","affiliation":["Department Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jenhui","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280681700"},{"name":"Jia-You Wu","affiliation":["Department Computer Science and Information Engineering, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-You","lastName":"Wu","id":"37933743500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4153-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3650-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-6245"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0324"}],"articleNumber":"5088987","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Downlink","WiMAX","Scheduling algorithm","Delay effects","Throughput","Distributed decision making","Time factors","Wireless networks","System performance","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-access systems","multimedia communication","OFDM modulation","scheduling","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["downlink delay minimized scheduling","OFDMA WiMAX systems","multimedia application","mobile stations","real time polling service"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["algorithm","OFDMA","packet scheduler","queue","real-time","wireless","WiMAX"]}],"abstract":"Due to the strict time constraints, the real-time services for multimedia applications in wireless networks are difficult to deal with as a packet scheduler schedules the related packets. The system performance of a base station (BS) mainly also depends on the packet scheduler policy. So far as our knowledge, the relatively existing packet scheduler schemes arrange the packets based on the corresponding delay time requirements for improving throughput or reducing dropping rate, not focus on deliberating how to reduce the delay time of packets efficiently as an important purpose. From this perspective, we have proposed our downlink delay-minimized scheduling (DDMS) algorithm for reducing the corresponding delay time for mobile stations (MSs) as our main contribution plus improves system throughput of the BS. Simulation results reveal that our DDMS algorithm outperformed in the reducing delay time, throughput and dropping rate by comparing with the other real-time polling service schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Downlink Delay-Minimized Scheduling Scheme for OFDMA WiMAX Systems","publicationTitle":"2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware","doi":"10.1109/MDM.2009.81","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware","pdfPath":"/iel5/5088898/5088899/05088987.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDM.2009.81","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5088899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5088987","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5088987/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Downlink Delay-Minimized Scheduling Scheme for OFDMA WiMAX Systems","conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5088987/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10720487","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Downlink Delay-Minimized Scheduling Scheme for OFDMA WiMAX Systems","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3650a459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066407S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5088898","isNumber":"5088899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5088898","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5088899","articleId":"5088987","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5088993,"authors":[{"name":"Chiu-Ching Tuan","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chiu-Ching","lastName":"Tuan","id":"37407954600"},{"name":"Jie-Hung Lee","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jie-Hung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37696319600"},{"name":"Shu-Jun Chao","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Computer and Communication Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Jun","lastName":"Chao","id":"37528285300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-4153-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3650-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1551-6245"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0324"}],"articleNumber":"5088993","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nearest neighbor searches","MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Tin","Clustering methods","Sensor systems","Sensor arrays","Chaotic communication","Costs","Mobile computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","MIMO communication","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nearest neighbor method","subtractive clustering-based method","antenna array","MIMO","wireless sensor network","sensor node","physical communication distances","subtractive clustering method","sink node","LEACH-based two-tier network","single-linkage method","visual multi-input-multi-output","HNN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Sensor node (SN)","MIMO","LEACH Protocol","HNN","Nearest-neighbor method"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5088993","doi":"10.1109/MDM.2009.87","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDM.2009.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5088899","publicationTitle":"2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware","displayPublicationTitle":"2009 Tenth International Conference on Mobile Data Management: Systems, Services and Middleware","pdfPath":"/iel5/5088898/5088899/05088993.pdf","startPage":"496","endPage":"501","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using Nearest Neighbor Method and Subtractive Clustering-Based Method on Antenna-Array Selection Used in Virtual MIMO in Wireless Sensor Network","abstract":"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is combined with many sensor node (SN).

In this paper, we proposed to use Subtractive Clustering method to determine the sink node on a LEACH-based Two-tier network and after that, using Nearest-neighbor method( i.e. Single-linkage method) to select the suitable nodes to act as the visual Multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) antenna-array, which are used to multiple transmitting and receiving data. Previous study have shown successfully that HNN could be used to select the nodes to act as the antennas-array of MIMO, however, the method we proposed, Nearest-neighbor method, can reach the same result but less computational time. Although, HNN method is known for its quickly convergence speed during the network learning operation. However, HNN still have to take more time than the method we proposed. This study was based on LEACH to formulate the visual MIMO antenna-array. Finally, we will discuss the simulation result and indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method for the further study.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5088993/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 May 2009","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 May 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5088993/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10720493","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using Nearest Neighbor Method and Subtractive Clustering-Based Method on Antenna-Array Selection Used in Virtual MIMO in Wireless Sensor Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using Nearest Neighbor Method and Subtractive Clustering-Based Method on Antenna-Array Selection Used in Virtual MIMO in Wireless Sensor Network","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"3650a496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059148S","chronDate":"18-20 May 2009","xplore-pub-id":"5088898","isNumber":"5088899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5088898","xplore-issue":"5088899","articleId":"5088993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5089055,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Liu","affiliation":["Department of computer science, HuaZhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Jing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37934042700"},{"name":"Li Chen","affiliation":["Department of computer science, HuaZhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Chen","id":"37934857300"},{"name":"Yuqing Dun","affiliation":["Department of computer science, HuaZhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yuqing","lastName":"Dun","id":"37936800100"},{"name":"Lingmin Liu","affiliation":["Department of computer science, HuaZhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lingmin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37935237400"},{"name":"Ganggang Dong","affiliation":["Department of computer science, HuaZhong Normal University, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Ganggang","lastName":"Dong","id":"37931419800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3556-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5089055","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":260},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089055","abstract":"Task scheduling is one of the core problems in grid computing.

Among various phenomena that consume energy, radio communication is by far the most demanding one. One of the effective ways to limit unnecessary energy loss is to control the power at which the nodes transmit signals. In this paper, we apply game theory to solve the power control problem in a CDMA-based distributed sensor network. We formulate a noncooperative game under incomplete information and study the existence of Nash equilibrium. With the help of this equilibrium, we devise a distributed algorithm for optimal power control and prove that the system is power stable only if the nodes comply with certain transmit power thresholds. We show that even in a noncooperative scenario, it is in the best interest of the nodes to comply with these thresholds. The power level at which a node should transmit, to maximize its utility, is evaluated. Moreover, we compare the utilities when the nodes are allowed to transmit with discrete and continuous power levels; the performance with discrete levels is upper bounded by the continuous case. We define a distortion metric that gives a quantitative measure of the goodness of having finite power levels and also find those levels that minimize the distortion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves the best possible payoff/utility for the sensor nodes even by consuming less power.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/5372162/05089316.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"242","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2009.82","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2009.82","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5372162","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Game Theoretic Framework for Power Control in Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Peer to peer computing","Power control","Game theory","Wireless sensor networks","Nash equilibrium","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","distributed control","game theory","optimal control","power control","telecommunication control","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theoretic framework","wireless sensor networks","sensor nodes","radio communication","energy efficiency","CDMA-based distributed sensor network","Nash equilibrium","distributed algorithm","optimal power control","power thresholds","distortion metric"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless sensor network","game theory","distributed power control","energy efficiency."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Game Theoretic Framework for Power Control in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"59","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5089316/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11069062","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Game Theoretic Framework for Power Control in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttc2010020231.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066561S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"5372162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"5372162","articleId":"5089316","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5089317,"authors":[{"name":"Gam D.

Maintaining neighborhood information for packet forwarding can achieve a high efficiency in geographic routing, but may not be appropriate for WSNs in highly dynamic scenarios where network topology changes frequently due to nodes mobility and availability. We propose a novel online routing scheme, called Energy-efficient Beaconless Geographic Routing (EBGR), which can provide loop-free, fully stateless, energy-efficient sensor-to-sink routing at a low communication overhead without the help of prior neighborhood knowledge. In EBGR, each node first calculates its ideal next-hop relay position on the straight line toward the sink based on the energy-optimal forwarding distance, and each forwarder selects the neighbor closest to its ideal next-hop relay position as the next-hop relay using the Request-To-Send/Clear-To-Send (RTS/CTS) handshaking mechanism. We establish the lower and upper bounds on hop count and the upper bound on energy consumption under EBGR for sensor-to-sink routing, assuming no packet loss and no failures in greedy forwarding. Moreover, we demonstrate that the expected total energy consumption along a route toward the sink under EBGR approaches to the lower bound with the increase of node deployment density. We also extend EBGR to lossy sensor networks to provide energy-efficient routing in the presence of unreliable communication links. Simulation results show that our scheme significantly outperforms existing protocols in wireless sensor networks with highly dynamic network topologies.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/71/5550955/05089321.pdf","startPage":"881","endPage":"896","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2009.98","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2009.98","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5550955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Beaconless Geographic Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089321/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2010","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Beaconless Geographic Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks","htmlLink":"/document/5089321/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2010","accessionNumber":"11476837","isJournal":true,"volume":"21","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Beaconless Geographic Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttd2010060881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098796S","chronDate":"June  2010","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"5550955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5550955","articleId":"5089321","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5089328,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada","Department of Information Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, Dalian, Liaoning, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/5370679/5089328/5089328-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Lin received the BSc degree in computer communications in 1999, the MSc degree in computer science in 2003 from Dalian Maritime University (China), and joined the Department of Information Engineering, Dalian Maritime University, as a faculty member in the same year.

To fully exploit the performance benefits of cooperative relaying, we develop an optimization framework to maximize the capacity as well as to meet the minimal traffic demand by each subscriber station (SS). In specific, the problem of joint RS placement and bandwidth allocation is formulated into a mixed-integer nonlinear program. We reformulate it into an integer linear program which is solvable by CPLEX. To avoid exponential computation time, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to efficiently solve the formulated problem. Numerical analysis is conducted through case studies to demonstrate the performance gain of cooperative relaying and the comparison between the proposed heuristic algorithm against the optimal solutions.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2009.114","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/5370679/05089328.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2009.114","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5370679","startPage":"259","endPage":"269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Relay Station Placement in Broadband Wireless Access Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Relay Station Placement in Broadband Wireless Access Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089328/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2010","accessionNumber":"11069056","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089328/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Relay Station Placement in Broadband Wireless Access Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2010020259.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069157S","chronDate":"Feb.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"5370679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5370679","articleId":"5089328","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5089404,"authors":[{"name":"Giulio Antonini","affiliation":["UAq EMC Laboratory, Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Giulio","lastName":"Antonini","id":"37275377400"},{"name":"Luca De Camillis","affiliation":["UAq EMC Laboratory, Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dellInformazione, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi dell'' Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"De Camillis","id":"37314215100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"5089404","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Sensitivity analysis","Multiconductor transmission lines","Voltage","Integrated circuit interconnections","Impedance","Frequency domain analysis","Transmission line matrix methods","Equations","Physics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain analysis","Green's function methods","multiconductor transmission lines","perturbation techniques","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-domain Green's function","sensitivity analysis","multiconductor transmission lines","nonlinear terminations","1-D wave propagation problem","time-domain macromodel","transient voltage sensitivity computation","perturbative approach","frequency-domain techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dyadic Green's function","interconnects","multi conductor transmission lines","sensitivity analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089404","abstract":"Time-domain sensitivity analysis of multiconductor transmission lines is derived from the dyadic Green's function of the 1-D wave propagation problem.

Mobility models used in traditional mobile ad hoc networks cannot directly be applied to VANETs since real-world factors such as road layouts and traffic regulations are not considered. In this paper, we propose a vehicular mobility model that reflects real-world vehicle movement and study the performance of packet-routing protocols. First, we study the routing in small-scale VANETs and propose two routing schemes: (1) connection-based restricted forwarding (CBRF) and (2) connectionless geographic forwarding (CLGF). With the insights obtained, we consider routing in large-scale VANETs. Since road complexity and traffic variety may cause many potential problems that existing routing protocols cannot address, we introduce a two-phase routing protocol (TOPO) that incorporates road map information. The proposed protocol defines an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">overlay</i>\n graph with roads of high vehicular density and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">access</i>\n graphs that are connected to the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">overlay</i>\n. While in the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">overlay</i>\n, packets are forwarded along a precalculated path. As far as \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">access</i>\n routing is concerned, we employ the aforementioned CBRF and CLGF schemes and send packets to the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">overlay</i>\n or handle packets delivered from the \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">overlay</i>\n. We argue that the TOPO can serve as a framework that integrates existing VANET routing protocols. We also consider data diversity in VANETs and design the TOPO as an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">intelligent transportation system (ITS)-friendly</i>\n protocol. To validate our design philosophy and the routing protocol, we use different areas in the city of Orlando, FL, and generate vehicular mobility traces, following our mobility models. We feed the traces to network simulators and study the routing behavior. Simulation results demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed routing protocols for large-scale VANET scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2025652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05089413.pdf","startPage":"5200","endPage":"5213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2025652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Small-Scale and Large-Scale Routing in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Small-Scale and Large-Scale Routing in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089413/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","volume":"58","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089413/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966652","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Small-Scale and Large-Scale Routing in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2025652.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102661S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5089413","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":5089414,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5307285/5089414/5089414-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Peng Lu (S'06) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 1999 and the M.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, in 2003.

The new scheme, which is termed as adaptive beam activation based on the conditional best beam index feedback (ABA-CBBI), requires low average feedback load by imposing a feedback threshold on the users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and suffers less multiuser interference by only activating those beams requested by at least one user. We derive the exact analytical expression for the sum-rate capacity of the resulting multiuser MIMO systems, based on which we examine the optimal selection of the feedback threshold in terms of sum-rate maximization. We demonstrate through selected numerical examples that the proposed ABA-CBBI scheme with optimal thresholds can achieve better sum-rate performance than existing schemes over high-signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple and Efficient User-Scheduling Strategy for RUB-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems and Its Sum-Rate Analysis","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2025703","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05089414.pdf","startPage":"4860","endPage":"4867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2025703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089414/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"A Simple and Efficient User-Scheduling Strategy for RUB-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems and Its Sum-Rate Analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5089414/","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10966623","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple and Efficient User-Scheduling Strategy for RUB-Based Multiuser MIMO Systems and Its Sum-Rate Analysis","sourcePdf":"tvt-yang-2025703.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056975S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5089414","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5089415,"authors":[{"name":"M.

For coherent modulation, binary phase-shift keying is employed where the phase is modulated by Mach-Zehnder external phase-modulator. The proposed architecture for optical network units and line terminals are also presented and analyzed. The network scalability of fiber link distances as well as bit-error rate, considering (1) fiber link noise e.g., amplifier spontaneous emission noise; (2) thermal noise; (3) photo-detectors' shot-noise; (4) relative intensity noise; and (5) mainly multiple-access interference, have been investigated. The results have indicated that this architecture can improve the network scalability, capacity and transmission performance, leading to the promising scheme for optical transport networks.","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2009.2025709","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/50/5196856/05089415.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2009.2025709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5196856","startPage":"3896","endPage":"3903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Scalability and Performance in Passive Optical CDMA Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089415","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Scalability and Performance in Passive Optical CDMA Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.1,  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089415/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"17","publicationDate":"Sept.1, 2009","accessionNumber":"10836770","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089415/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Scalability and Performance in Passive Optical CDMA Networks","sourcePdf":"jlt-hghafouri-shiraz-2025709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07406S","chronDate":"Sept.1,  2009","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"5196856","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5196856","articleId":"5089415","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5089416,"authors":[{"name":"Cosme E.

To fill this gap, we analyze the frequency-domain (non-causal) multichannel linear filtering for noise reduction in this paper. For completeness, we consider the noise reduction constrained optimization problem that leads to the parameterized multichannel non-causal Wiener filter (PMWF). Our contribution is fivefold. First, we formally show that the minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) filter is a particular case of the PMWF by properly formulating the constrained optimization problem of noise reduction. Second, we propose new simplified expressions for the PMWF, the MVDR, and the generalized sidelobe canceller (GSC) that depend on the signals' statistics only. In contrast to earlier works, these expressions are explicitly independent of the channel transfer function ratios. Third, we quantify the theoretical gains and losses in terms of speech distortion and noise reduction when using the PWMF by establishing new simplified closed-form expressions for three performance measures, namely, the signal distortion index, the noise reduction factor (originally proposed in the paper titled ldquoNew insights into the noise reduction Wiener filter,rdquo by J.

We consider the hysteresis nonlinearity of the actuator as a disturbance over a linear system.

In contrast to the existing inverse-model-based approach, the DOB-based hysteresis compensation does not rely on any particular hysteresis model, and therefore provides a simple and effective compensation mechanism. We design and fabricate a lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) piezoelectric actuator for microscale tip-based power sintering process. Experimental validation of the proposed hysteresis compensation is performed on the PMN-PT cantilever piezoelectric actuator.

It produces a frequency spreading of the characteristic fault frequencies, thus making it difficult to detect with spectral or envelope analysis. A statistical analysis of typical bearing faults is proposed here in order to identify the spreading bandwidth related to specific conditions, relying on current or vibration measurements only. Then, a diagnostic index based on the computation of the energy in the previously defined bandwidth is used to diagnose bearing faults. The proposed method was validated experimentally with vibration signals, with robust and reliable results.

As a consequence, CORDIC has been utilized for applications in diverse areas such as signal and image processing, communication systems, robotics and 3-D graphics apart from general scientific and technical computation.

Simulation results demonstrate that they offer near-optimal performance.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025794","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05089451.pdf","startPage":"4482","endPage":"4496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Auction Approach to Resource Allocation in Uplink OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089451/","displayDocTitle":"An Auction Approach to Resource Allocation in Uplink OFDMA Systems","volume":"57","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918047","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089451/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Auction Approach to Resource Allocation in Uplink OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-xwang-2025794.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099142S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5089451","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5089452,"authors":[{"name":"Felip Riera-Palou","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Spain"],"firstName":"Felip","lastName":"Riera-Palou","id":"38276004600"},{"name":"Guillem Femenias","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Group, Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Balearic Islands, Mallorca, Spain"],"firstName":"Guillem","lastName":"Femenias","id":"37266545400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"5089452","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":134},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency diversity","Multicarrier code division multiple access","Maximum likelihood detection","Wireless networks","Frequency division multiplexing","Resilience","Fading","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","fading channels","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM","code-division multiplex orthogonal frequency-division multiplex","adaptive frequency diversity","group-orthogonal","wireless channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive systems","frequency diversity","group-orthogonal","maximum likelihood","multicarrier"]}],"abstract":"Code-division multiplex orthogonal frequency-division multiplex (CDM-OFDM) has received considerable attention due to its superior resilience against subcarrier fading in comparison with conventional OFDM. More recently, group-orthogonal CDM-OFDM (GO-CDM-OFDM) has been considered as a suitable method to extract additional frequency diversity of the wireless channel by splitting the available subcarriers into (orthogonal) groups and applying optimum detection at the receiver on a per-group basis. One critical parameter of this scheme is the group size as it can effectively act like a complexity-performance trading knob. In this work an adaptive technique to dynamically adjust the group size as a function of the instantaneous operating scenario is presented. It is shown that this adaptivity can bring along important reductions in complexity without compromising error performance.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2009.2025837","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5170191/05089452.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2009.2025837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5170191","startPage":"837","endPage":"840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM With Adaptive Frequency Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089452","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"OFDM With Adaptive Frequency Diversity","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089452/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"16","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","accessionNumber":"10791385","dateOfInsertion":"21 July 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089452/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM With Adaptive Frequency Diversity","sourcePdf":"16lsp10-friera-palou-2025837.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087044S","chronDate":"Oct.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5170191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5170191","articleId":"5089452","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5089453,"authors":[{"name":"Timo Gerkmann","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Acoustics (IKA), Ruhr Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/5286803/5089453/5089453-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Timo Gerkmann studied electrical engineering at the Universit\u00e4t Bremen, Bremen, Germany, and the Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum, Bochum, Germany.

We show that if chi-distributed spectral amplitudes are smoothed in the cepstral domain, the resulting smoothed spectral amplitudes are also approximately chi-distributed but with more degrees of freedom and less signal power. The key finding for the proposed power bias compensation method is that the degrees of freedom of chi-distributed spectral amplitudes are directly related to their average cepstral variance. Furthermore, this work gives new insights into the statistics of the cepstral coefficients derived from chi-distributed spectral amplitudes using tapered spectral analysis windows. We derive explicit expressions for the variance and covariance of correlated chi-distributed spectral amplitudes and the resulting cepstral coefficients, parameterized by the degrees of freedom. The results in this work allow for a cepstral smoothing of spectral quantities without affecting their signal power. As we assume the parameterized chi-distribution for the spectral amplitudes, the results hold for Gaussian, super-Gaussian, and sub-Gaussian distributed complex spectral coefficients. The proposed bias compensation method is computationally inexpensive and shown to work very well for white and colored signals, as well as for rectangular and tapered spectral analysis windows.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089453/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918049","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Statistics of Spectral Amplitudes After Variance Reduction by Temporal Cepstrum Smoothing and Cepstral Nulling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Statistics of Spectral Amplitudes After Variance Reduction by Temporal Cepstrum Smoothing and Cepstral Nulling","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-tgerkmann-2025795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057491S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5089453","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5089455,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Kurt Schneider","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering and the Interdisciplinary Program of Integrated Biotechnology, Sogang University, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electronics, Federal University of Technology, Curitiba, Brazil","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Fabio Kurt","lastName":"Schneider","id":"38565273900"},{"name":"Anup Agarwal","affiliation":["Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA, USA","Philips Healthcare, Bothell, WA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Anup","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37288523700"},{"name":"Yang Mo Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Sogang University, Seoul, Korea","Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Yang Mo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37299715300"},{"name":"Tetsuya Fukuoka","affiliation":["Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Fukuoka","id":"37298014700"},{"name":"Yongmin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Yongmin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280925600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7771"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0032"}],"articleNumber":"5089455","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1012},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","url":"http://www.embs.org"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society [Technical Co-Sponsor]","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Ultrasonic imaging","Biomedical imaging","Field programmable gate arrays","Digital signal processing","Signal processing algorithms","Array signal processing","Digital signal processors","Digital signal processing chips","Biomedical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","array signal processing","biomedical equipment","biomedical ultrasonics","computer architecture","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","medical signal processing","ultrasonic transducer arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["programmable computing architecture","medical ultrasound machines","application specific integrated circuits","ASIC","receive beamforming","front end algorithms","field programmable gate array","FPGA","digital signal processor","DSP","ultrasound signal processing","front end processing","back end processing","B mode imaging","low level ultrasound machines","medium level ultrasound machines"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","ultrasound systems"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Biomedical Engineering","Computer Systems","Equipment Design","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Ultrasonography","Ultrasonography"]}],"abstract":"Application-specific ICs have been traditionally used to support the high computational and data rate requirements in medical ultrasound systems, particularly in receive beamforming.

It is a fundamental rethinking of existing concepts. It considers the encoder a mechanism that produces signal measurements from which the decoder estimates the original signal. The method is based on linear predictive coding and Kalman estimation at the decoder. We employ a novel encoder state-space representation with a linear quantization noise model. The encoder is represented by the Kalman measurement at the decoder. The presented method designs the encoder and decoder offline through an iterative algorithm based on closed-form minimization of the trace of the decoder state error covariance. The design method is shown to provide considerable performance gains, when the transmitted quantized prediction errors are subject to loss, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) compared to the same coding framework optimized for no loss. The design method applies to stationary auto-regressive sources of any order. We demonstrate the method in a framework based on a generalized differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) encoder. The presented principles can be applied to more complicated coding systems that incorporate predictive coding as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089460/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","accessionNumber":"10918052","displayDocTitle":"On Predictive Coding for Erasure Channels Using a Kalman Framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Predictive Coding for Erasure Channels Using a Kalman Framework","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-tarildsen-2025796.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074421S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","articleId":"5089460","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5089461,"authors":[{"name":"Pei-Yin Chen","affiliation":["Digital IC Design Laboratory, Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan County, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5444572/5089461/5089461-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pei-Yin Chen (M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, in 1986, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Pennsylvania State University, University Park, in 1990, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from National Cheng Kung University.

The scheme can identify the faulty nodes efficiently and improve the performance of the decision fusion significantly. It achieves very good performance at the expense of such extensive computations as exponent and multiplication/division in the detecting process. In many real-time WSN applications, the fusion center might be implemented in an ASIC and included in a standalone device. Therefore, a simple and efficient decision fusion scheme requiring lower hardware cost and power consumption is extremely desired. In this paper, we propose the approximated collaborative sensor fault detection (ACSFD) scheme and its VLSI architecture. Given the low circuit complexity, it is suitable for hardware implementation. The ACSFD circuit contains 9265 gates and requires a core size of 368 \u00d7 358 \u00bfm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n by using TSMC 0.18 \u00bfm cell library.

Many existing hyperspectral unmixing algorithms were developed under a commonly used assumption that pure pixels exist. However, the pure-pixel assumption may be seriously violated for highly mixed data. Based on intuitive grounds, Craig reported an unmixing criterion without requiring the pure-pixel assumption, which estimates the endmembers by vertices of a minimum-volume simplex enclosing all the observed pixels. In this paper, we incorporate convex analysis and Craig's criterion to develop a minimum-volume enclosing simplex (MVES) formulation for hyperspectral unmixing. A cyclic minimization algorithm for approximating the MVES problem is developed using linear programs (LPs), which can be practically implemented by readily available LP solvers. We also provide a non-heuristic guarantee of our MVES problem formulation, where the existence of pure pixels is proved to be a sufficient condition for MVES to perfectly identify the true endmembers. Some Monte Carlo simulations and real data experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed MVES algorithm over several existing hyperspectral unmixing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2009.2025802","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5286803","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2009.2025802","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5286803/05089462.pdf","startPage":"4418","endPage":"4432","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Convex Analysis-Based Minimum-Volume Enclosing Simplex Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Convex Analysis-Based Minimum-Volume Enclosing Simplex Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","volume":"57","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089462/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","accessionNumber":"10918083","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089462/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Convex Analysis-Based Minimum-Volume Enclosing Simplex Algorithm for Hyperspectral Unmixing","sourcePdf":"57tsp11-cchi-2025802.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141454S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5286803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"247","xplore-issue":"5286803","articleId":"5089462","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5089467,"authors":[{"name":"Gerhard Diendorfer","affiliation":["Department of Austrian Lightning Detection and Information System (ALDIS), Australian Electrotechnical Association, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/5208467/5089467/5089467-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gerhard Diendorfer (M\u201999) was born in Austria in 1957.

First, we show that through row and column permutations the parity check matrix H can be put in a concatenation form of row-permuted block-diagonal matrices. Encoding utilizing this form can be performed in linear time and in parallel. Second, we derive a rule to determine the nonzero entries of H and present determinate and semi-determinate codes. Our simulations show that the determinate and semi-determinate codes have better performance than codes with randomly generated nonzero entries for GF(16) and GF(64), and have similar performance for GF(256). The constructed determinate and semi-determinate codes over GF(64) and GF(256) can outperform the binary irregular counterparts of the same block lengths. One distinct advantage for determinate and semi-determinate codes is that they greatly reduce the storage cost of H for decoding. The results in this correspondence are appealing for the implementation of efficient encoders and decoders for this class of promising LDPC codes, especially when the block length is large.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070066","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5089481/05089486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089481","startPage":"1560","endPage":"1565","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Group-theoretic analysis of cayley-graph-based cycle gf(2<sup>p</sup>) codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Group-theoretic analysis of cayley-graph-based cycle gf(2<sup>p</sup>) codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089486/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731872","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089486/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Group-theoretic analysis of cayley-graph-based cycle gf(2<sup>p</sup>) codes","sourcePdf":"1560-tc0906-huang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058876S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5089487,"authors":[{"name":"Yifei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Yifei","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37558964300"},{"name":"William E.

For some cases, this is due to their increased decoding complexity relative to the classical coding techniques. For other cases, this is due to their inability to reach very low bit error rates (e.g., 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-12</sup>\n) at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), a consequence of the error rate floor phenomenon associated with iterative LDPC decoders. In the present paper, we make strides in the low-floor problem by identifying the weaknesses of the code under study and applying compensatory counter-measures. These counter-measures include: modifying the code itself, modifying the decoder, or adding a properly designed outer algebraic code. Our results demonstrate that each of these techniques can successfully lower an LDPC code's floor, and that, for the code under study, an outer BCH code appears to be particularly effective.

For comparison purposes, the true Cramer-Rao lower bound is numerically evaluated, obtaining an analytical expression in closed form for the asymptotic case of high SNR values, which quantifies the performance loss with respect to coherent estimation. As the maximum-likelihood algorithm is too complex for practical implementation, an expectation-maximization (EM) approach is proposed, achieving a good tradeoff between complexity and performance for medium-to-high SNRs.

The error floor has been attributed to certain subgraphs of an LDPC code's Tanner graph induced by so-called trapping sets. We show in this paper that once we identify the trapping sets of an LDPC code of interest, a sum-product algorithm (SPA) decoder can be custom-designed to yield floors that are orders of magnitude lower than floors of the the conventional SPA decoder. We present three classes of such decoders: (1) a bi-mode decoder, (2) a bit-pinning decoder which utilizes one or more outer algebraic codes, and (3) three generalized-LDPC decoders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these decoders for two codes, the rate-1/2 (2640,1320) Margulis code which is notorious for its floors and a rate-0.3 (640,192) quasi-cyclic code which has been devised for this study. Although the paper focuses on these two codes, the decoder design techniques presented are fully generalizable to any LDPC code.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089505/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"57","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10731891","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089505/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low-floor decoders for LDPC codes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-floor decoders for LDPC codes","sourcePdf":"1663-tc0906-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086362S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089505","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5089507,"authors":[{"name":"Thorsten Hehn","affiliation":["Institute for Information Transmission (LIT), University of Erlangen, Nuremberg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5089481/5089507/5089507-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Thorsten Hehn (S'04) received the diploma degree in electrical engineering from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany, in late 2003.

Besides the decoding performance, the data delay caused by the channel code is of great importance as this is a crucial factor for many applications. Convolutional codes are known to show a good performance while imposing only a very low latency on the data. LDPC codes yield superior decoding performance but impose a larger delay due to the block structure. The results obtained by comparison will also be related to theoretical limits obtained from random coding and the sphere packing bound. It will be shown that convolutional codes are still the first choice for applications for which a very low data delay is required and the bit error rate is the considered performance criterion. However, if one focuses on a low signal-to-noise ratio or if the obtained frame error rate is the base for comparison, LDPC codes compare favorably.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.080014","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.080014","startPage":"1683","endPage":"1692","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5089481/05089507.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089481","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LDPC codes and convolutional codes with equal structural delay: a comparison","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"LDPC codes and convolutional codes with equal structural delay: a comparison","volume":"57","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731893","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089507/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LDPC codes and convolutional codes with equal structural delay: a comparison","sourcePdf":"1683-tc0906-hehn.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121174S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5089508,"authors":[{"name":"Niklas Wernersson","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5089481/5089508/5089508-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Niklas Wernersson (S\u201903) was born in Bor\u00e5s, Sweden, in 1976.

Specifically, we propose a digital signal transmission scheme employing overcomplete Weyl-Heisenberg (W-H) frames as modulation pulses. The proposed W-H frame transmission scheme, which relaxes the conventional orthogonality/biorthogonality constraints for perfect transmultiplexing, can be viewed as a generalization of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and nonorthogonal (biorthogonal) frequency division multiplexing (NOFDM). With this new transmission scheme, one can not only achieve higher spectral efficiency effectively but also design the pulse shape more flexibly to combat the impact of the propagation channel. In order to optimally mitigate the intersymbol interference (ISI) and interchannel interference (ICI) caused by the wireless channel, the selections of the Gaussian pulse shape and T-F grid parameters are addressed jointly from the viewpoint of minimum energy perturbation for several typical channel scattering functions. Simulation results are presented to study the performance of the proposed system. It is shown that the proposed overcomplete W-H frame transmission system with a lower-order constellation is more robust against the TF dispersive channels than the incomplete Riesz basis system employing a higher-order constellation with the same spectral efficiency.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070406","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5089481/05089511.pdf","startPage":"1721","endPage":"1733","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless multicarrier digital transmission via weyl-heisenberg frames over time-frequency dispersive channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Wireless multicarrier digital transmission via weyl-heisenberg frames over time-frequency dispersive channels","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5089511/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731897","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089511/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless multicarrier digital transmission via weyl-heisenberg frames over time-frequency dispersive channels","sourcePdf":"1721-tc0906-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123471S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089511","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5089513,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering at the City College,City College and Graduate Center, City University of New York, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5089481/5089513/5089513-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi Sun received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 1982 and 1985, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, in 1997.","From 1985 to 1993, he was a lecturer at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

We use a binary-asymmetric channel (BAC) model for an OCDMA system employing an all-optical passive correlator receiver. Source coherence effects lead to relative-intensity-noise (RIN) and phase-induced-intensity-noise (PIIN), which are included in our analysis. Previous studies only considered multiple access interference (MAI) noise, resulting in a Z-channel (where errors only occur for the transmission of data bit zero) model, and neglected RIN and PIIN. The presence of RIN and PIIN leads to errors occurring for both transmitted data bits one and zero, thus a BAC model. We show that source matching gain depends on the normalized source coherence time, defined as the ratio of the optical source coherence time to the bit duration. Our analysis shows that, while MAI limited analysis predicts that increasing the number of users increases the source matching gain, when taking into account RIN and PIIN, source matching gain is both bit rate and source type dependent, and tends to zero for very high numbers of users.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5089481/05089516.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070334","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089481","startPage":"1776","endPage":"1783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance degradation of source matching in optical CDMA due to source coherence effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance degradation of source matching in optical CDMA due to source coherence effects","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089516/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731902","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089516/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance degradation of source matching in optical CDMA due to source coherence effects","sourcePdf":"1776-tc0906-rad.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074511S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089516","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5089517,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

In this paper, we propose new sensing methods based on the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of signals received at the secondary users. In particular, two sensing algorithms are suggested, one is based on the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue to minimum eigenvalue; the other is based on the ratio of the average eigenvalue to minimum eigenvalue. Using some latest random matrix theories (RMT), we quantify the distributions of these ratios and derive the probabilities of false alarm and probabilities of detection for the proposed algorithms. We also find the thresholds of the methods for a given probability of false alarm. The proposed methods overcome the noise uncertainty problem, and can even perform better than the ideal energy detection when the signals to be detected are highly correlated. The methods can be used for various signal detection applications without requiring the knowledge of signal, channel and noise power. Simulations based on randomly generated signals, wireless microphone signals and captured ATSC DTV signals are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089517/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","volume":"57","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10731903","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089517/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing algorithms for cognitive radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Eigenvalue-based spectrum sensing algorithms for cognitive radio","sourcePdf":"1784-tc0906-zeng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064951S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"789","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089517","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5089519,"authors":[{"name":"W.-H.

We propose the modified hidden semi-Markov model (MHSMM) for modeling the flat fading envelope process. The properties of the envelope process are dominated by the physical fading processes and speeds of the mobile terminal. Thus, the statistics of the fading process may be non-stationary, due to different fading conditions over some time durations. The MHSMM incorporate these time-variant statistics of the envelope process in a single model, which facilitates computations of the envelope probability density function and the autocorrelation function. We provide a parameter estimation scheme to estimate the MHSMM parameters. We demonstrate the proposed parameter estimation scheme by using simulated and experimental data. The simulation is based on the GSM system parameters often encountered in practical conditions. We conducted two experiments, including cooperating and noncooperating channel disturbances. Based on these data, the MHSMM is compared with the amplitude-based finite-state Markov chains model and the hidden Markov model. The results verify the advantages of the MHSMM and the effectiveness of the associated parameter estimation schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089519/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","volume":"57","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"10731905","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089519/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modified hidden semi-markov model for modelling the flat fading channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified hidden semi-markov model for modelling the flat fading channel","sourcePdf":"1806-tc0906-chung.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094733S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089519","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5089520,"authors":[{"name":"Zoran Hadzi-Velkov","affiliation":["Ss Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, Macedonia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5089481/5089520/5089520-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zoran Hadzi-Velkov (M\u201997) received the Dipl.Ing.

More specifically, motivated by the fact that this channel is a cascaded one and can be modeled as the product of N fading amplitudes, we derive novel analytical expressions for the average LCR and the AFD of the product of N Rayleigh fading envelopes (or of the recently so-called NRayleigh channel). Furthermore, we derive simple and efficient closed-form approximations to the aforementioned parameters, using the multivariate Laplace approximation theorem. It is shown that our general results reduce to the corresponding ones of the specific dual-hop case, previously published.

The scheme consists of coset-codes constructed on multi-dimensional lattices with a combination of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and classical Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. To approach the capacity of an ISI-constrained channel, the code is easy to employ in conjunction with spectral shaping, Tomlinson- Harashima precoding and decision-feedback equalization (DFE). The scheme performs within 2-2.5 dB of un-shaped channel capacity (the sphere-bound) at very low BER's, even with regular LDPC codes of modest block lengths. We investigate dense multidimensional lattices such as the Schlafli, Gosset, Barnes-Wall, and Leech lattices, besides simple one-dimensional lattices. Via the density evolution technique, we show that the lattices reduce the noise threshold of belief-propagation decoders. We investigate the practical application of the proposed schemes to 10G-Base-T, an emerging Ethernet standard over twisted-pairs at 10 Gbit/sec. A simple 1-dimensional scheme improves upon recent proposals by 0.5-1 dB at BER's approaching 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-11</sup>\n, with half the LDPC coding complexity.

The TMRC scheme is the optimum structure for single beamforming systems in terms of received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in multiple-input single-output (MISO) channels. In this paper, we generalize the TMRC scheme to multiple beamforming multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems which support more than one data stream in coded systems. We express each beamforming vector as a linear combination of TMRC vectors whose coefficients are optimized in a successive manner. Optimization of the beamforming vector is followed by the decorrelation process. All TMRC vectors used as a basis of the remaining beamforming vectors are made orthogonal to previously computed beamforming vectors. Exploiting the concept of the gradient ascent algorithm, we propose a simple non-iterative method of computing the precoder which obtains the near optimal performance. Also we derive a closed form expression of the output SNR distribution for the proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves the almost identical link performance as the SVD-based system for arbitrary configurations with reduced complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5089481/05089523.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089481","startPage":"1847","endPage":"1856","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new beamforming structure based on transmit-MRC for closed-loop MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089523","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new beamforming structure based on transmit-MRC for closed-loop MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731909","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089523/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new beamforming structure based on transmit-MRC for closed-loop MIMO systems","sourcePdf":"1847-tc0906-park.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068023S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5089524,"authors":[{"name":"T.-H.

Although IFDMA is free from the multiple access interference (MAI), it suffers from intersymbol interference (ISI). MIMO-IFDMA system suffers from both ISI and multi-stream interference (MSI). The block iterative generalized decision feedback equalizer (BI-GDFE) is an iterative and effective interference cancellation scheme which could provide near maximum likelihood (ML) performance with very low complexity. However, BI-GDFE needs the channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we utilize the soft estimates of the transmitted symbols provided by the BI-GDFE to estimate the channel via an expectation maximization (EM)-based algorithm. By doing so, a joint channel estimation and data detection receiver is developed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed channel estimation algorithm, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Computer simulations show that the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed joint channel estimation and signal detection receiver can reach the performance of the BI-GDFE with perfect CSI.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5089481/05089524.pdf","startPage":"1857","endPage":"1865","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A joint channel estimation and data detection receiver for multiuser MIMO IFDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Intersymbol interference","Multiple access interference","Bit error rate","Frequency conversion","Decision feedback equalizers","Interference cancellation","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","decision feedback equalisers","error statistics","expectation-maximisation algorithm","frequency division multiple access","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","iterative methods","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint channel estimation","data detection receiver","multiuser MIMO IFDMA systems","multiinput multioutput system","interleaved frequency division multiple access system","multiple access interference","intersymbol interference","multistream interference","block iterative generalized decision feedback equalizer","interference cancellation scheme","iterative cancellation scheme","maximum likelihood performance","channel state information","expectation maximization-based algorithm","Cramer-Rao lower bound","bit error rate","CSI"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-input Multi-ouput (MIMO), interleaved frequency division multiple access (IFDMA), channel estimation, expectation maximization (EM) algorithm."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089524/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A joint channel estimation and data detection receiver for multiuser MIMO IFDMA systems","volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5089524/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731910","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A joint channel estimation and data detection receiver for multiuser MIMO IFDMA systems","sourcePdf":"1857-tc0906-pham.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.175804S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089524","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5089525,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Channel state information at the receiver (CSIR) is exploited but the CSIR is imperfect with its uncertainty being modeled as a random Gaussian matrix. Our objective is to devise an energy-efficient solution to minimize the individual users' transmit power while meeting the users' signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) constraints, under the consideration of CSIR and its error characteristics. This is achieved by solving a sum-power minimization problem, subject to a collection of users' outage probability constraints on their target SINRs. Regarding the signal power minus the sum of inter-user interferences (SMI) power as Gaussian, an iterative and convergent algorithm which is proved to reach the global optimum for the joint power allocation and receive beamforming solution, is proposed, though the optimization problem is indeed non-convex. A systematic scheme to detect feasibility and find a feasible initial solution, if there exists any, is also devised. Simulation results verify the use of Gaussian approximation and robustness of the proposed algorithm in terms of users' probability constraints, and indicate a significant performance gain as compared to the zero-forcing (ZF) and minimum mean square- error (MMSE) beamforming systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-efficient multiuser SIMO: achieving probabilistic robustness with gaussian channel uncertainty","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070574","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5089481/05089525.pdf","startPage":"1866","endPage":"1878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2009.06.070574","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089481","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089525","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089525/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Energy-efficient multiuser SIMO: achieving probabilistic robustness with gaussian channel uncertainty","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5089525/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731911","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-efficient multiuser SIMO: achieving probabilistic robustness with gaussian channel uncertainty","sourcePdf":"1866-tc0906-zheng.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122602S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5089481","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5089481","articleId":"5089525","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5089533,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) based inertial sensors are light but not accurate enough for inertial navigation system (INS) applications. An integrated INS/GPS system provides better accuracy compared with either INS or GPS, used individually. This paper describes an improved design and fabrication of a loosely coupled INS-GPS integrated system. The systems currently available use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and are, therefore, not optimized for compact, single supply, and low power requirements. In the proposed system, a digital signal processor (DSP) is used for inertial navigation solution and Kalman filter computations. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) is used for creating an efficient interface of the GPS with the DSP. Direct serial interface of the GPS involve tedious processing overhead on the navigation processor. Therefore, a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) and dual port random axis memory (DPRAM) are created on the FPGA itself. This also reduces the total chip count, resulting in a compact system. The system is designed to give real time processed navigation solutions with an update rate of 100 Hz. All the details of this work are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5089533","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5089526/05089533.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5089533","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089526","startPage":"443","endPage":"454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Development of a Real-Time DSP and FPGA-Based Integrated GPS-INS System for Compact and Low Power Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design and Development of a Real-Time DSP and FPGA-Based Integrated GPS-INS System for Compact and Low Power Applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089533/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10720716","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089533/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Development of a Real-Time DSP and FPGA-Based Integrated GPS-INS System for Compact and Low Power Applications","sourcePdf":"45aes02-Agarwal.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096799S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5089526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5089526","articleId":"5089533","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5089534,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["United Technologies Research Center, Inc., East Hartford, CT, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5089526/5089534/5089534-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin Zhang (S'01\u2014M'06) received the B.S. and M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 1997 and 2000, respectively.

Rissanen's minimum description length (MDL) criterion will be used to decide the number of existing extended objects.

Nonstationarity within a coherent processing interval (CPI) often precludes target detection because of the masking induced by Doppler spreading of the clutter. Across range bins (i.e., fast time), nonstationarity severely limits the amount of training data available to estimate the noise covariance matrix required for adaptive detection. Such difficult clutter conditions are not uncommon in complex multipath propagation conditions where path lengths can change abruptly in dynamic scenarios. To mitigate nonstationary Doppler spread clutter, an approximation to the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector is presented wherein the CPI from the hypothesized target range is used for both clutter estimation and target detection. To overcome the lack of training data, a modified time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) model is assumed for the clutter return. In particular, maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the TVAR parameters, computed from a single snapshot of data, are used in a GLRT for detecting stationary targets in possibly abruptly nonstationary clutter. The GLRT is compared with three alternative methods including a conceptually simpler ad hoc approach based on extrapolation of quasi-stationary data segments. Detection performance is assessed using simulated targets in both synthetically-generated and real radar clutter. Results suggest the proposed GLRT with TVAR clutter modeling can provide between 5-8 dB improvement in signal-to-clutter plus noise ratio (SCNR) when compared with the conventional methods.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Radar Detection in Doubly Nonstationary Autoregressive Doppler Spread Clutter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5089536","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5089526/05089536.pdf","startPage":"484","endPage":"501","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5089536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089536/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Radar Detection in Doubly Nonstationary Autoregressive Doppler Spread Clutter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5089536/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10720719","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Radar Detection in Doubly Nonstationary Autoregressive Doppler Spread Clutter","sourcePdf":"45aes02-Ramakrishnan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144674S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5089526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5089526","articleId":"5089536","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5089537,"authors":[{"name":"Liu Jiong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, State Key Laboratory on Microwave & Digital Communications, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5089526/5089537/5089537-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liu Jiong received B.S. degree from Nanjing Institude of Communication Engineering in 1996, and the the M.S. from Air Force Engineering University in 2002, respectively.

Existing TCP protocols perform very well for Internet access on wired networks. However, in the case of satellite channels, due to the effects of high bandwidth asymmetry, long propagation delay, high sporadic bit error rate (BER) and burst errors, TCP performance degrades significantly. In this paper, a new end-to-end transport protocol, TP-Satellite, is proposed for satellite IP networks. TP-Satellite replaces the traditional slow start algorithm with a novel super start algorithm. In order to distinguish congestion events from link errors, a new scheme is introduced, which is based on alternate transmission of different class priority packets. Bandwidth asymmetry problems are addressed by the adoption of a modified negative acknowledgement (M-NACK) strategy, which periodically sends M-NACK packets. Simulation results show that TP-Satellite enhances the throughput performance on the forward path, reduces the bandwidth used in the reverse path, and offers a fair share of network resources.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5089537","startPage":"502","endPage":"515","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5089537","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089526","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5089526/05089537.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TP-Satellite: A New Transport Protocol for Satellite IP Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089537/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"TP-Satellite: A New Transport Protocol for Satellite IP Networks","volume":"45","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5089537/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10720720","publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TP-Satellite: A New Transport Protocol for Satellite IP Networks","sourcePdf":"45aes02-Jiong.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083362S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5089526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"5089526","articleId":"5089537","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5089542,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Gebert","affiliation":["Microwaves and Radar Institute (HR), German Aerospace Center, Wessling, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5089526/5089542/5089542-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nicolas Gebert received the Dipl.-Ing (M.S.) from the Munich University of Technology (TU M\u00fcnchen), Munich, Germany, in 2003.","He is currently as a Ph.D. student with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany.

However, conventional SAR systems are not capable of fulfilling the increasing demands for improved spatial resolution and wider swath coverage. To overcome these inherent limitations, several innovative techniques have been suggested which employ multiple receive-apertures to gather additional information along the synthetic aperture. These digital beamforming (DBF) on receive techniques are reviewed with particular emphasis on the multi-aperture signal processing in azimuth and a multi-aperture reconstruction algorithm is presented that allows for the unambiguous recovery of the Doppler spectrum. The impact of Doppler aliasing is investigated and an analytic expression for the residual azimuth ambiguities is derived. Further, the influence of the processing on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is analyzed, resulting in a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) dependent factor describing the SNR scaling of the multi-aperture beamforming network. The focus is then turned to a complete high-resolution wide-swath SAR system design example which demonstrates the intricate connection between multi-aperture azimuth processing and the system architecture. In this regard, alternative processing approaches are compared with the multi-aperture reconstruction algorithm. In a next step, optimization strategies are discussed as pattern tapering, prebeamshaping-on-receive, and modified processing algorithms. In this context, the analytic expressions for both the residual ambiguities and the SNR scaling factor are generalized to cascaded beamforming networks. The suggested techniques can moreover be extended in many ways. Examples discussed are a combination with ScanSAR burst mode operation and the transfer to multistatic sparse array configurations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digital Beamforming on Receive: Techniques and Optimization Strategies for High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5089542","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5089526/05089542.pdf","startPage":"564","endPage":"592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5089542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089542","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089542/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","displayDocTitle":"Digital Beamforming on Receive: Techniques and Optimization Strategies for High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR Imaging","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5089542/","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10720724","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital Beamforming on Receive: Techniques and Optimization Strategies for High-Resolution Wide-Swath SAR Imaging","sourcePdf":"45aes02-Gebert.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122893S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5089526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"306","xplore-issue":"5089526","articleId":"5089542","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":5089547,"authors":[{"name":"Shannon D.

To correct for Doppler-induced filter mismatch over a single pulse, the Doppler-compensated adaptive pulse compression (DC-APC) algorithm is presented whereby the respective Doppler shifts for large target returns are jointly estimated with the illuminated range profile and subsequently incorporated into the original APC adaptive receive filter formulation. As a result, the Doppler-mismatch-induced range sidelobes can be suppressed thereby regaining a significant portion of the sensitivity improvement that is possible when applying adaptive pulse compression (APC) without the existence of significant Doppler mismatch. In contrast, instead of compensating for Doppler mismatch, the single pulse imaging (SPI) algorithm generalizes the APC formulation for a bank of Doppler-shifted matched filters thereby producing a sidelobe-suppressed range-Doppler image from the return signal of a single radar pulse which is applicable for targets with substantial variation in Doppler. Both techniques are based on the recently proposed APC algorithm and its generalization, the multistatic adaptive pulse compression (MAPC) algorithm, which have been shown to be effective for the suppression of pulse compression range sidelobes thus dramatically increasing the sensitivity of pulse compression radar.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089547/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10720729","htmlLink":"/document/5089547/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"2","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Doppler Compensation & Single Pulse Imaging using Adaptive Pulse Compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Doppler Compensation & Single Pulse Imaging using Adaptive Pulse Compression","sourcePdf":"45aes02-Blunt.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051006S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5089526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5089526","articleId":"5089547","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5089550,"authors":[{"name":"Nadav Levanon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering-Systems, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7/5089526/5089550/5089550-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nadav Levanon (S67'\u2014M'70\u2014SM'83\u2014F'98\u2014LF'06) is a professor at Tel Aviv University, Israel, where he has been a faculty member since 1970.

This problem is exacerbated as the transmitted waveform is not under control of the radar designer and the sidelobes of the ambiguity function can mask targets including those displaced in either (or both) range and Doppler from the disturbance. A novel multistage approach is developed for disturbance cancellation and target detection based on projections of the received signal in a subspace orthogonal to both the disturbance and previously detected targets. The resulting algorithm is shown to be effective against typical simulated scenarios with a limited number of stages, and a version with computational savings is also introduced. Finally its effectiveness is demonstrated with the application to real data acquired with an experimental VHF PBR system.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5089551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5089551","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5089526/05089551.pdf","startPage":"698","endPage":"722","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multistage Processing Algorithm for Disturbance Removal and Target Detection in Passive Bistatic Radar","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089551/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"A Multistage Processing Algorithm for Disturbance Removal and Target Detection in Passive Bistatic Radar","volume":"45","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10720733","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089551/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multistage Processing Algorithm for Disturbance Removal and Target Detection in Passive Bistatic Radar","sourcePdf":"45aes02-Colone.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079888S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5089526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"296","xplore-issue":"5089526","articleId":"5089551","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5089553,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Lei","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Lei","id":"37086624282"},{"name":"Michael Rice","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Rice","id":"37280227500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"5089553","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1053},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089553","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multipath channels","Telemetry","Acoustic propagation","Reflection","Propagation delay","Oceans","Line-of-sight propagation","Frequency measurement","Sea measurements","Geometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channels","telemetry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath channel model","over-water aeronautical telemetry","multipath propagation model","channel sounding experiments","channel frequency responses"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5089553","endPage":"742","startPage":"735","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5089526/05089553.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5089553","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipath Channel Model for Over-Water Aeronautical Telemetry","abstract":"A multipath propagation model for aeronautical telemetry over water at 8.0 GHz is presented.

The modeling results show that a three-ray model consisting of line-of-sight propagation and two reflected propagation paths is a good fit for the measured channel frequency responses. One of the reflected propagation paths is a strong specular reflection determined by the geometry defined by the airborne transmitter, the ground-based receiver, and the sea surface. For the flight profiles used, the delay of this path is between 10 and 50 ns. The other propagation path is a more diffuse, random reflection whose amplitude is significantly smaller than the amplitude of the specular reflection and whose mean excess delay is 57 ns with an rms delay spread of 25 ns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089553/","volume":"45","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5089553/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10720735","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multipath Channel Model for Over-Water Aeronautical Telemetry","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipath Channel Model for Over-Water Aeronautical Telemetry","sourcePdf":"45aes02-Lei-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074191S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5089526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5089526","articleId":"5089553","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5089560,"authors":[{"name":"Carroll J.

It can be classified as a form of continuous phase modulation (CPM), but its major distinction from other CPMs is that it has a constrained (correlated) ternary data alphabet. CPM-based detection models for SOQPSK have been developed only recently. While these detectors offer an appreciable performance gain over current detection schemes, one roadblock standing in the way of their being adopted is the lack of a CPM-based symbol timing recovery scheme that will work with SOQPSK. We show how an existing CPM-based timing error detector (TED) can be adapted to the unique characteristics of SOQPSK. The TED is formulated for a coherent detector but can be extended to the noncoherent case. We apply this timing recovery method to the versions of SOQPSK used in military (MIL-STD SOQPSK) and telemetry group (SOQPSK-TG) standards. We derive the theoretical performance limits on the accuracy of timing recovery for SOQPSK, as given by the modified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB), and show that the proposed decision-directed TED (DD-TED) performs close to these bounds in computer simulations and is free of false-lock points. We also show that the proposed scheme outperforms a non-data-aided TED (NDA-TED) that was recently developed for SOQPSK. These results show that the proposed scheme has great promise in a wide range of applications due to its low complexity, strong performance, and lack of false-lock points.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5089526/05089561.pdf","startPage":"781","endPage":"789","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5089561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5089561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decision-Directed Symbol Timing Recovery for SOQPSK","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Timing","Military standards","Detectors","Telemetry","Quadrature phase shift keying","Bandwidth","Phase modulation","Continuous phase modulation","Performance gain","Military computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phase shift keying","synchronization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision directed symbol timing recovery","SOQPSK","shaped offset quadrature phase shift keying","continuous phase modulation","ternary data alphabet","timing error detector","modified Cramer-Rao bound"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Decision-Directed Symbol Timing Recovery for SOQPSK","volume":"45","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5089561/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10720742","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decision-Directed Symbol Timing Recovery for SOQPSK","sourcePdf":"45aes02-Chandran-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070676S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5089526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5089526","articleId":"5089561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5089562,"authors":[{"name":"Ruhai Wang","affiliation":["Drayer Department of Electrical Engineering, Lamar University, Beaumont, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ruhai","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280230600"},{"name":"Stephen Horan","affiliation":["Klipsh School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Stephen","lastName":"Horan","id":"37269147700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9251"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9603"},{"format":"CD","value":"2371-9877"}],"articleNumber":"5089562","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":424},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Aerospace &amp; Electronic Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-aess.org/default.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Transport protocols","Space technology","Communication standards","Communication system control","Emulation","Communications technology","Artificial satellites","Communication channels","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space communication links","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["protocol testing","space communication protocol standard","transport protocol","transmission control protocol","NASA geostationary orbit","Advanced Communications Technology Satellite","space communication channels","channel bandwidth","channel rate asymmetry"]}],"abstract":"As the transport layer protocol of the Space Communication Protocol Standard (SCPS) suite, SCPS-Transport Protocol (SCPS-TP) is actually transmission control protocol (TCP), with a set of extensions aimed at improving TCP performance in space communications. Some work has been done on the performance evaluation of SCPS-TP in comparison with TCP. However, those works have been done by testing SCPS-TP via emulation test-beds. We present the file transfer experimental work of testing the SCPS protocol stack over NASA's geostationary orbit (GEO) Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS). Considering that space communication channels in practice are frequently asymmetric in terms of channel bandwidth, our work is concentrated on the evaluation of the effectiveness of SCPS-TP in coping with channel rate asymmetry. We conclude that SCPS-TP is better suited than TCP over long-delayed, asymmetric, satellite channels with a throughput advantage of over 30 Kbyte/s for the transmission of a 10 Mbyte file. A hybrid of the channel rate control and acknowledgment frequency reduction mechanisms makes significant contributions to the performance enhancement of SCPS-TP over asymmetric space channels.","doi":"10.1109/TAES.2009.5089562","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/7/5089526/05089562.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAES.2009.5089562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"790","endPage":"798","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Protocol Testing of SCPS-TP over NASA's ACTS Asymmetric Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089562","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Protocol Testing of SCPS-TP over NASA's ACTS Asymmetric Links","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089562/","volume":"45","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5089562/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10720743","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Protocol Testing of SCPS-TP over NASA's ACTS Asymmetric Links","sourcePdf":"45aes02-Wang-cr.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079532S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7","isNumber":"5089526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5089526","articleId":"5089562","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5089840,"authors":[{"name":"C.

It has reportedly outperformed a few evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and other search heuristics like the particle swarm optimization (PSO) when tested over both benchmark and real-world problems. DE, however, is not completely free from the problems of slow and/or premature convergence. This paper describes a family of improved variants of the DE/target-to-best/1/bin scheme, which utilizes the concept of the neighborhood of each population member. The idea of small neighborhoods, defined over the index-graph of parameter vectors, draws inspiration from the community of the PSO algorithms. The proposed schemes balance the exploration and exploitation abilities of DE without imposing serious additional burdens in terms of function evaluations. They are shown to be statistically significantly better than or at least comparable to several existing DE variants as well as a few other significant evolutionary computing techniques over a test suite of 24 benchmark functions. The paper also investigates the applications of the new DE variants to two real-life problems concerning parameter estimation for frequency modulated sound waves and spread spectrum radar poly-phase code design.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2008.2009457","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5089880/05089881.pdf","startPage":"526","endPage":"553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2008.2009457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Differential Evolution Using a Neighborhood-Based Mutation Operator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089881/","displayDocTitle":"Differential Evolution Using a Neighborhood-Based Mutation Operator","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10720821","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Differential Evolution Using a Neighborhood-Based Mutation Operator","sourcePdf":"tevc-das-2009457.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07121S","chronDate":"June  2009","isNumber":"5089880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"816","articleId":"5089881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5089895,"authors":[{"name":"Quang Huy Nguyen","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/5089880/5089895/5089895-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Quang Huy Nguyen received the B.Eng.

The term MAs is now widely used as a synergy of evolutionary or any population-based approach with separate individual learning or local improvement procedures for problem search. Quite often, MAs are also referred to in the literature as Baldwinian EAs, Lamarckian EAs, cultural algorithms, or genetic local searches. In the last decade, MAs have been demonstrated to converge to high-quality solutions more efficiently than their conventional counterparts on a wide range of real-world problems. Despite the success and surge in interests on MAs, many of the successful MAs reported have been crafted to suit problems in very specific domains. Given the restricted theoretical knowledge available in the field of MAs and the limited progress made on formal MA frameworks, we present a novel probabilistic memetic framework that models MAs as a process involving the decision of embracing the separate actions of evolution or individual learning and analyzing the probability of each process in locating the global optimum. Further, the framework balances evolution and individual learning by governing the learning intensity of each individual according to the theoretical upper bound derived while the search progresses. Theoretical and empirical studies on representative benchmark problems commonly used in the literature are presented to demonstrate the characteristics and efficacies of the probabilistic memetic framework. Further, comparisons to recent state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, memetic algorithms, and hybrid evolutionary-local search demonstrate that the proposed framework yields robust and improved search performance.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2008.2009460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/5089880/05089895.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2008.2009460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089880","startPage":"604","endPage":"623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Probabilistic Memetic Framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Probabilistic Memetic Framework","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089895/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10720826","dateOfInsertion":"19 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089895/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Probabilistic Memetic Framework","sourcePdf":"tevc-nguyen-2009460.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109751S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"5089880","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"178","xplore-issue":"5089880","articleId":"5089895","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5089903,"authors":[{"name":"Damir Zarko","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, Department of Electrical Machines, Drives and Automation, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia"],"bio":{"p":["Damir \u017darko was born in Zagreb, Croatia.

Such a configuration corresponds to a passive magnetic bearing. All the calculations are determined by using the Coulombian model. The paper also discusses the optimal ring dimensions that provide a large force or stiffness between the rings. Such properties are commonly sought in passive magnetic bearings. We propose a three-dimensional method for optimizing these parameters. An important result is established in this paper: the exact relative position of the rings for which the force is the strongest depends on the air gap dimension. As the expressions in this paper give this exact relative position, manufacturers can easily optimize their passive magnetic bearings. This result is new because the curvature effect is taken into account. Such semianalytical expressions are more precise than the numerical evaluation of the magnetic forces obtained with the finite-element method. In addition, semianalytical expressions have a low computational cost whereas the finite-element method is computation-intensive. Such calculations make it easy to optimize quadripolar lenses and other devices utilizing permanent magnets.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2009.2016088","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/5089896/05089905.pdf","startPage":"2996","endPage":"3002","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2009.2016088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Force and Stiffness of Passive Magnetic Bearings Using Permanent Magnets.

The neural network compensator, which is an add-on function on top of nominal feedback control, uses the accelerometer signals obtained from a sensor to detect external vibrations. Our feedforward control can be regarded as a nonlinear finite impulse response (FIR) that corresponds to linear FIR when the basis function of the neural network is linear. By neural network learning, the tracking performance of hard disk drives can be improved with no information on disturbance dynamics or sensor model. We have analyzed the stability of the proposed scheme by the Lyapunov criterion.

In these protocols, routing is based on the positions of neighboring nodes. In particular, the next-hop node is selected according to either a distance-based strategy, which favors a neighbor with the largest distance progress toward the sink, or a direction-based strategy, which favors a neighbor with the lowest angle deviation toward the sink. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid geographic routing (HGR) scheme that combines both distance- and direction-based strategies in a flexible manner. To further facilitate a tradeoff between energy consumption and end-to-end delay, we propose two dynamic HGR (DHGR) mechanisms based on the basic HGR scheme, which are designed to satisfy constraints on the average end-to-end delay of specific applications while minimizing energy consumption. Packet-delivery decisions are locally made, and the state at a node is independent of the number of nodes in the network; thus, DHGR has the inherent scaling property of geographic routing. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is evaluated by analysis and extensive simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2009.2025767","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2009.2025767","startPage":"4976","endPage":"4988","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5307285/05089940.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5307285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid Geographic Routing for Flexible Energy\u2014Delay Tradeoff","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid Geographic Routing for Flexible Energy\u2014Delay Tradeoff","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"10 November 2009","volume":"58","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089940/","accessionNumber":"10966635","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089940/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid Geographic Routing for Flexible Energy\u2014Delay Tradeoff","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2025767.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.145106S","chronDate":"Nov.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5307285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5307285","articleId":"5089940","onlineDate":"19 June 2009","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":5089944,"authors":[{"name":"Emanuele Viterbo","affiliation":["DEIS, Universit\u00e0 della Calabria, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Viterbo","id":"37284379900"},{"name":"Yi Hong","affiliation":["DEIS, Universit\u00e0 della Calabria, Cosenza, Italy"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Hong","id":"37276995200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5089944","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":336},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"The Golden space-time trellis coded modulation (GST-TCM) scheme was proposed for a high rate 2 times 2 multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system over slow fading channels.

This paper proposes a new linear diagonal MIMO transceiver, referred to as co-ordinate interleaved spatial multiplexing (CISM). With CSI at transmitter and receiver, CISM diagonalizes the MIMO channel and interleaves the co-ordinates of the input symbols (from rotated QAM constellations) transmitted over different eigenmodes. The analytical and simulation results show that with co-ordinate interleaving across two eigenmodes, the diversity gain of the data stream transmitted over the weaker eigenmode becomes equal to that of the data transmitted on the stronger eigenmode, resulting in a significant improvement in the overall diversity. The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is analyzed for CISM and is shown that it achieves higher diversity gain at all positive multiplexing gains compared to existing diagonal transceivers.

multiple access code division multiplexing (OFDMA-CDM) system which exploits both orthogonality among users and symbol-level diversity. To predict the link performance, we analyze the postprocessing SNR as the transmit power (TP) varies when the minimum mean square error combiner (MMSEC) is employed. It is shown from analysis that the MMSEC SNR is nonlinear in TP, but is bounded by the harmonic and the arithmetic means of the subcarrier SNRs. From the observation, we propose two variable PRA methods using a simple channel quality indication and a required TP estimation method. Simulation results show that the proposed methods not only guarantee the target performance but also increase the throughput at the same or slightly increased feedback overhead compared with the fixed TP allocation case.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089951.pdf","startPage":"2776","endPage":"2782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable power and rate allocation using simple CQI for multiuser OFDMA-CDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multicarrier code division multiple access","Code division multiplexing","Feedback","Frequency diversity","Frequency conversion","Performance analysis","Mean square error methods","Arithmetic","Throughput","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiplexing","least mean squares methods","multiuser channels","OFDM modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable power allocation","rate allocation","multiuser OFDMA-CDM system","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","minimum mean square error combiner","channel quality indication","transmit power estimation method","code division multiplexing system","signal-to-noise ratio"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA, code division multiplexing, link adaptation power and rate allocation, MMSE receiver"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Variable power and rate allocation using simple CQI for multiuser OFDMA-CDM systems","volume":"8","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5089951/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731365","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable power and rate allocation using simple CQI for multiuser OFDMA-CDM systems","sourcePdf":"2776-tw0906-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109791S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5089952,"authors":[{"name":"Himal A.

In this research, we consider a network structure where the spectrum sensing task is separated from the unlicensed users (secondary users). The service provider for the secondary users needs to place sensing devices within the networks of licensed users (primary users). These sensing devices sense the primary users' activity. The sensing devices also decide whether to admit a secondary user's transmission. A new cognitive cycle is proposed accordingly. The proposed protocol is analyzed using the theory of Lam\u00e9 curve. The problem of optimally locating sensing devices and the properties of the proposed system are studied for single-user case and multi-user case. For the case without a separate control channel, a lowtemperature handshake technique is proposed for handshakes between the secondary users and the sensing devices. The other advantage of the proposed scheme is from the business model point of view: the expensive sensing devices will be implemented by the cognitive radio service provider, instead of being built in the secondary user devices which are usually consumer products demanding low cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089958/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","accessionNumber":"10721258","htmlLink":"/document/5089958/","displayDocTitle":"Replacement of Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Replacement of Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio","sourcePdf":"2819-tw0906-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061007S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089958","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5089961,"authors":[{"name":"Tae Won Ban","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Tae Won","lastName":"Ban","id":"37738311800"},{"name":"Wan Choi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Wan","lastName":"Choi","id":"37281364300"},{"name":"Dan Keun Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dan Keun","lastName":"Sung","id":"37276225900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5089961","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":836},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the capacity and energy efficiency of spectrum sharing systems with opportunistic user selection where a secondary network utilizes spectrum bands licensed to a primary network under interference regulation. In spectrum sharing systems, secondary users consume a fraction of their resources in sensing the channels to the primary users to comply with the interference constraints. Although more resources for sensing improve reliability and performance, the throughput loss due to time overhead and energy loss due to power overhead should be properly incorporated in performance evaluation. In this context, we define and derive a new metric-average capacity normalized by the total energy consumption-reflecting time and power overhead for spectrum sensing. Based on the developed framework, the optimal normalizedcapacity is investigated. We also propose a simple and practical suboptimal best-n scheme motivated by the infeasibility and high computational complexity of the optimal strategy, where n denotes the number of sensing secondary users. Our analytical and simulation results show that the proposed best-1 scheme is an energy-efficient technique with near optimality in terms of the capacity normalized by the energy consumption.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy efficiency","Performance loss","Interference constraints","Power system reliability","Throughput","Energy loss","Computational complexity","Computational modeling","Analytical models","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","frequency allocation","multi-access systems","performance evaluation","radiofrequency interference","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency","multi-user spectrum sharing","opportunistic scheduling","user selection","interference regulation","throughput loss","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrum sharing, cognitive radio, sensing power, multiuser diversity"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089961.pdf","startPage":"2836","endPage":"2841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity and Energy Efficiency of Multi-User Spectrum Sharing Systems with Opportunistic Scheduling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity and Energy Efficiency of Multi-User Spectrum Sharing Systems with Opportunistic Scheduling","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089961/","volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089961/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10731371","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity and Energy Efficiency of Multi-User Spectrum Sharing Systems with Opportunistic Scheduling","sourcePdf":"2836-tw0906-ban.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048208S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5089963,"authors":[{"name":"Min-kuan Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Min-kuan","lastName":"Chang","id":"37277969700"},{"name":"Shi-yong Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shi-yong","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293443800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5089963","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":52,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1019},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Fading","Bit error rate","Relays","Communication systems","AWGN","Error analysis","Protective relaying","Cooperative systems","Closed-form solution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","error statistics","modulation","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication system","hierarchical modulation","Rayleigh fading channel","bit error rate","point-to-point transmissions","additive white Gaussian noise channels","AWGN channels","BER","optimal distance parameters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hierarchical modulation, cooperative communication, BER analysis, AWGN, and Rayleigh fading"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089963","abstract":"Much attention had been devoted to study the bit error rate (BER) of hierarchical modulation on point-to-point transmissions in recent years. But few mention the error performance of hierarchical modulation on cooperative communication systems. Thus, in this paper, we derive the explicit closed-form expressions of the exact bit error rate computation for cooperative communication systems with hierarchical modulation over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and Rayleigh fading channels. To obtain the theoretical formulas of error rate performance, an analyzing model is proposed to clearly express all possibilities of each transmission. For error rate performance, the expression for BER is a function of distance parameters. Based on this relationship, a criterion is proposed to choose the optimal distance parameters for minimizing the BER of the refinement bits while guaranteeing the BER requirement of the base bits. Simulation results validate the correctness of the derived BERs of the base bits and the refinement bits. Also from simulation results, the performance with optimal distance parameters is greatly improved compared to the non-optimal distance parameters.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","startPage":"2848","endPage":"2852","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081077","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081077","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089963.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of cooperative communication system with hierarchical modulation over rayleigh fading channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089963/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of cooperative communication system with hierarchical modulation over rayleigh fading channel","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10721259","volume":"8","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5089963/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of cooperative communication system with hierarchical modulation over rayleigh fading channel","sourcePdf":"2848-tw0906-chang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042112S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5089965,"authors":[{"name":"Yue Shang","affiliation":["Signal Processing and Communications Group, MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Shang","id":"37292149000"},{"name":"Xiang-gen Xia","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"firstName":"Xiang-gen","lastName":"Xia","id":"37274950700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5089965","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":528},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Silicon carbide","Signal processing algorithms","Covariance matrix","Interference cancellation","MIMO","Scattering","Signal to noise ratio","Signal detection","Filters","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference suppression","recursive estimation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast recursive algorithms","V-BLAST","optimal ordered SIC detection","vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time","successive interference cancellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast recursive algorithm, MMSE, successive interference cancellation, V-BLAST, ZF"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089965","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","abstract":"A fast recursive algorithm for the vertical Bell Laboratories layered space-time (V-BLAST) with the optimal ordered successive interference cancellation (SIC) detection has been proposed by Benesty-Huang-Chen and two improved algorithms have been also recently introduced by Szczecinski-Massicotte and Zhu-Lei-Chin independently.

We derive high-SNR approximations for the outage probability.

Since then they have been extensively researched and applied in various ways. Compared with conventional lighting devices, the white LED has lower power consumption, lower voltage requirements, longer lifetime, smaller size, faster response, and cooler operation. The white LED will eventually replace incandescent or fluorescent lights in offices and homes. We have proposed an indoor visible light wireless communication system that utilizes multiple white LED lighting equipment. In this system, the equipment is used not only for illuminating rooms but also for an optical wireless communication system. The system has significantly higher power levels than infrared wireless communication systems, since it also functions as the main lighting equipment. One problem is we tend to install many lighting sources on a ceiling in order to illuminate the room as evenly as possible. While the number of sources permits site diversity transmission over LOS links, the optical path difference between the multiple sources triggers intersymbol interference (ISI), which significantly degrades system performance. This paper overcomes the ISI problem by proposing an adaptive equalization system. We elucidate the most effective training sequence interval for channel estimation in a mobile environment. And we show that the adaptive equalization system with the effectual interval alleviates the influence of shadowing.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive equalization system for visible light wireless communication utilizing multiple white LED lighting equipment","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.060258","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089970.pdf","startPage":"2892","endPage":"2900","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.060258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive equalization system for visible light wireless communication utilizing multiple white LED lighting equipment","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5089970/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10721262","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive equalization system for visible light wireless communication utilizing multiple white LED lighting equipment","sourcePdf":"2892-tw0906-komine.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07378S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"159","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5089971,"authors":[{"name":"Rim Barrak","affiliation":["CirtaCom Laboratory,Cit\u00e9 technologique desCommunications El Ghazala, Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications, Ariana, Tunisia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5089971/5089971-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rim Barrak received the B.S. degree in Circuits and Systems from the Ecole Polytechnique de Tunisie, Tunis, Tunisa, in 2000, and the M.S. degree in telecommunications from the Ecole Poly technique de Montr\u00e9al Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2002 and the Ph.D. degree in communication and information technologies from the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure des Communications-SUP'COM, Tunis, Tunisia in 2007.

This receiver topology is based on two subsampling stages. The first stage has a fixed RF subsampling frequency; however, the IF sampling frequency of the second stage is variable and depends on the standard being considered. This approach overcomes various undesirable effects related to the sampling frequencies and noise aliasing. By optimizing the choice of the RF subsampling clock frequency, complete multistandard RF bands are down-converted to the same IF band. Quadrature baseband channel downconversion is achieved by a tunable IF sampling frequencies clock. A tunable band-pass RF filter and an IF band-pass filter are designed to perform anti-aliasing and limit wideband noise. A generic design methodology is proposed and validated through its application to a GSM, UMTS and IEEE-802.11g multistandard receiver. Simulation results of this receiver design example confirm the validation of proposed subsampling receiver topology and show the efficiency of the design methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089971/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731377","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimized multistandard RF subsampling receiver architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized multistandard RF subsampling receiver architecture","sourcePdf":"2901-tw0906-barrak.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062046S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089971","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5089972,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Su","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, UCLA, USA"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Su","id":"37402247700"},{"name":"Mihaela van Der Schaar","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr.

We model the interaction between selfish users as a non-cooperative game. As opposed to the existing iterative water-filling algorithm that studies the myopic users, this paper studies how a foresighted user, who knows the channel state information and response strategies of its competing users, should optimize its transmission strategy. To characterize this multi-user interaction, the Stackelberg equilibrium is introduced, and the existence of this equilibrium for the investigated noncooperative game is shown. We analyze this interaction in more detail using a simple two-user example, where the foresighted user determines its transmission strategy by solving as a bi-level program which allows him to account for the myopic user's response. It is analytically shown that a foresighted user can improve its performance, if it has the necessary information about its competitors. Since the optimal solution of Stackelberg equilibrium is computationally prohibitive, we propose a practical low-complexity approach based on Lagrangian duality theory. Numerical simulations verify the performance improvements. Possible ways to acquire the required information and to extend the formulation to more than two users are also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.071058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089972.pdf","startPage":"2910","endPage":"2919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.071058","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Perspective on Multi-User Power Control Games in Interference Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089972","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089972/","displayDocTitle":"A New Perspective on Multi-User Power Control Games in Interference Channels","volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10721263","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089972/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Perspective on Multi-User Power Control Games in Interference Channels","sourcePdf":"2910-tw0906-su.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091651S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5089973,"authors":[{"name":"Tianyu Wu","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5089973/5089973-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["T.Y.

OFDMA system with a practical resource fair round robin allocation and erroneous feedback channel is considered. The performances of the resource allocation based on three feedback methods are analyzed and compared. A resource-wise signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) quantization based feedback method is considered and two feedback strategies are based on the best-M method, where the M best resource blocks are informed to the transmitter. Analytical bit error probability (BEP) expressions are derived for binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation for each feedback strategy. Furthermore, an asymptotic BEP performance for large SNR values is derived for the best-M feedback schemes.

Hence, time division duplex (TDD) systems and their crossed-slot interference problems in a cellular environment have been attracting growing interests. Considering large signaling overhead between cells, decentralized time slot allocation (TSA) strategy is suitable for practical implementation. Thus, Fixed-TSA strategy which fixes the same ratio of uplink and downlink time slots in all cells is adopted in commercial WiBro systems (IEEE802.16e Mobile WiMax) to mitigate the crossed-slot interference. However, the Fixed-TSA strategy reduces the flexibility in time slot allocation due to a strong constraint set by a predefined boundary. Moreover, the mathematical derivation of the optimal value for the predefined boundary has not been presented yet. In this paper, we propose two decentralized TSA strategies. The first one is Enhanced Fixed-TSA strategy, which dynamically adapts the predefined boundary of the conventional Fixed-TSA strategy according to traffic conditions. The second one is region-based Decentralized Time Slot Allocation (RED-TSA) strategy, which utilizes partial location information of MSs to reduce crossedslot interference. We fully analyze the proposed TSA strategies in terms of new call blocking probability, average bit error probability, and the overall system throughput. Numerical results show that the proposed RED-TSA strategy provides the highest system throughput by compromising both new call blocking performance and average bit error performance, whereas it requires additional location information and complicated computation. On the contrary, the proposed Enhanced Fixed-TSA strategy requires reasonable computational complexity while it provides almost the same system throughput with that of the proposed RED-TSA strategy. In a nutshell, the proposed Enhanced Fixed- TSA strategy is more appropriate for the practical systems. Moreover, it can be directly applied to the current commercial WiMax/WiBro systems with minimum changes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080137","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089980.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","startPage":"2990","endPage":"3003","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of decentralized time slot allocation strategies for asymmetric traffic in TDD systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089980","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of decentralized time slot allocation strategies for asymmetric traffic in TDD systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089980/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731379","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089980/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of decentralized time slot allocation strategies for asymmetric traffic in TDD systems","sourcePdf":"2990-tw0906-sohn.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123324S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":5089981,"authors":[{"name":"Saad G.

Finding distributed solutions to this global optimization problem however, remains a challenging task. In this work, we first focus on the maximization of the weighted sum-rate capacity, as this allows the incorporation of QoS criteria in the objective function. For the case of two links, we are able to analytically characterize the optimal solution to the weighted sum-rate maximization problem. However, computing the optimal solution requires centralized knowledge of network information. We thus formulate a framework for distributed power optimization valid for N mutually interfering links, based on the concept of channel state partitioning. By assuming instantaneous knowledge of local information and statistical knowledge of non-local information, we derive a distributed power allocation algorithm, which we first analyze for the case of N = 2. Although a gain is observed over equal power allocation, the distributed algorithm shows a performance gap as compared to a centralized solution, as expected. We show however, that minimal information message passing (in this case one bit) between interfering links can help reduce this gap substantially. Finally, we also propose a method to incorporate user scheduling into the distributed power allocation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089981.pdf","startPage":"3004","endPage":"3015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed power allocation for interfering wireless links based on channel information partitioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089981","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089981/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power allocation for interfering wireless links based on channel information partitioning","volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731380","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089981/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power allocation for interfering wireless links based on channel information partitioning","sourcePdf":"3004-tw0906-kiani.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13872S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089981","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5089982,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Krikidis","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, University of Edinburgh, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5089982/5089982-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Krikidis (S'03-M'07) was born in Athens, Greece, in 1977.

In contrast to previously reported work, where the effect of interference is ignored, the effect of multi-user interference in AF schemes is analyzed. It is shown that the interference changes the statistical description of the conventional AF protocol and a statistical expression is subsequently derived. Asymptotic analysis of the expression shows that interference limits the diversity gain of the system and the related channel capacity is bounded by a stationary point. In addition, it is proven that previously proposed relay selection criteria for multi-relay scenarios become inefficient in the presence of interference. Based on consideration of the interference term, two extensions to the conventional max-min selection scheme suitable for different system setups are proposed. The extensions investigated are appropriate for legacy architectures with limitations on their flexibility where the max-min operation is pre-designed. A theoretical framework for selecting when to apply the proposed selection criteria is also presented. The algorithm investigated is based on some welldefined capacity approximations and incorporates the outage probabilities averaged over the fading statistics. Analytical results and simulation studies reveal enhancements of the proposed algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080383","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089982.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080383","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","startPage":"3016","endPage":"3027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Max-min relay selection for legacy amplify-and-forward systems with interference","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Max-min relay selection for legacy amplify-and-forward systems with interference","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089982/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10721269","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089982/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Max-min relay selection for legacy amplify-and-forward systems with interference","sourcePdf":"3016-tw0906-krikidis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095644S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"212","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"},{"_id":5089984,"authors":[{"name":"Jingbo Gao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5089984/5089984-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jingbo Gao received the Ph.D. degree in Electronics and Information Engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2006.

However,cooperative transmission can not be guaranteed to perform better always than direct transmission, since the statistics of both direct and relay channels are varied due to large scale fading. Therefore, we design an opportunistic criterion to automatically determine which transmission mode should be adopted depending on the channel quality from the source to the cooperative relay, as opposed to the deterministic cooperation regardless of relay channel conditions. According to the proposed criterion, we further present two opportunistic cooperation schemes, namely, the SDC (selection diversity combining) -based and the MRC (maximum ratio combining) -based opportunistic cooperation, and develop the closed-form expressions of outage probability for the proposed schemes over Rayleigh fading channels. For the purpose of comparison, we also analyze the outage probability for the known deterministic cooperation and coded cooperation. Numerical results show that our schemes outperform the traditional schemes in terms of outage probability, especially when the relay channel conditions worsen. In addition, we compare the MRC-based opportunistic cooperation with the SDC-based opportunistic cooperation, showing the superiority of the former scheme.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080653","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089988.pdf","startPage":"3077","endPage":"3085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage analysis of opportunistic cooperation over rayleigh fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089988","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089988/","displayDocTitle":"Outage analysis of opportunistic cooperation over rayleigh fading channels","volume":"8","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731385","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5089988/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage analysis of opportunistic cooperation over rayleigh fading channels","sourcePdf":"3077-tw0906-zou.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08157S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089988","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5089989,"authors":[{"name":"M.

A selection combining scheme is used to obtain an easily implementable receiver structure at the destination. An analytical expression for the end-to-end symbol error probability (SEP) of the system for M-ary phase shift keying is derived using a new approach, which we call a paired error approach. As a special case, we obtain, in closed form, the end-to-end SEP for binary phase shift keying. We also present a modified selection combining scheme to incorporate the effect of the interuser link, that is, the source to relay link, in the evaluation of the error performance. Results show that cooperative diversity becomes effective for a larger range of average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the user to destination link as the average SNR of the interuser link increases. We also find that the modified selection combining scheme offers a substantial SNR gain over selection combining based cooperation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080665","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","startPage":"3086","endPage":"3094","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089989.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error analysis of the decode and forward protocol with selection combining","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089989/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Error analysis of the decode and forward protocol with selection combining","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731386","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"8","issue":"6","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error analysis of the decode and forward protocol with selection combining","sourcePdf":"3086-tw0906-selvaraj.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055155S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5089990,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Iyanda Sulyman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5089990/5089990-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ahmed Iyanda Sulyman (M'04) was born in Nigeria in 1968.

We consider here Gaussian interference relay games (GIRGs), where instead of allocating the power budget across a set of sub-channels, each player aims to decide the optimal power control strategy across a set of hops. We show that the GIRG always possesses a unique NE for a two-player version of the game, irrespective of any channel realization or initial system parameters such as power budgets and noise power. Furthermore, we derive explicitly a sufficient condition under which the NE achieves Pareto-optimality. To facilitate decentralized implementation, we propose a distributed and asynchronous algorithm. We also prove that the proposed algorithm always converges to the unique NE from an arbitrary starting point. We then conclude that the distributed game-theoretic approach exhibits great potential in the context of interference relay channels and qualifies as a practically appealing candidate for power control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","htmlLink":"/document/5089996/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731390","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A game-theoretic approach for distributed power control in interference relay channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A game-theoretic approach for distributed power control in interference relay channels","sourcePdf":"3151-tw0906-shi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071597S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":5089998,"authors":[{"name":"Vassilis Ntranos","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, Crete, Greece"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5089998/5089998-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vassilis Ntranos received the Diploma in Electronic and Computer Engineering (ECE) from the Technical University of Crete (TUC), Greece, in 2008.

The main difference with the point-to-point transmit beamforming problem is that in multicast beamforming the channel is naturally modeled as a Gaussian mixture, as opposed to a single Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian components in the mixture model user clusters of different means (locations) and variances (spreads). It is shown that minimizing outage probability subject to a transmit power constraint is an NP-hard problem when the number of Gaussian kernels, J, is greater than or equal to the number of transmit antennas, N. Through dimensionality reduction, it is also shown that the problem is practically tractable for 2 - 3 Gaussian kernels. An approximate solution based on the Markov inequality is also proposed. This is simple to compute for any J and N, and often works well in practice.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089998.pdf","startPage":"3172","endPage":"3181","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.080850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.080850","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On multicast beamforming for minimum outage","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Signal to noise ratio","Kernel","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Signal design","Telecommunication computing","Gaussian distribution","NP-hard problem","Femtocell networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","Gaussian channels","Gaussian distribution","Markov processes","multicast communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multicast beamforming problem","outage probability","transmit power constraint","point-to-point transmit problem","Gaussian mixture","wireless channel model","single Gaussian distribution","NP-hard problem","Gaussian kernels","Markov inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multicast beamforming, outage probability, transmit power constraint"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","displayDocTitle":"On multicast beamforming for minimum outage","volume":"8","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5089998/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10721246","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On multicast beamforming for minimum outage","sourcePdf":"3172-tw0906-ntranos.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11404S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089998","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5089999,"authors":[{"name":"Elena-Veronica Belmega","affiliation":["Joint Laboratory of CNRS, LSS, Sup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5089942/5089999/5089999-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Elena-Veronica Belmega was born in Fagaras, Romania.

The players (the mobile terminals) are free to choose their PA in order to maximize their individual transmission rates (in particular they can ignore some specified centralized policies). A simple coordination mechanism between users is introduced. The nature and influence of this mechanism is studied in detail. The coordination signal indicates to the users the order in which the receiver applies successive interference cancellation and the frequency at which this order is used. Two different games are investigated: the users can either adapt their temporal PA to their decoding rank at the receiver or optimize their spatial PA between their transmit antennas. For both games a thorough analysis of the existence, uniqueness and sum-rate efficiency of the network Nash equilibrium is conducted. Analytical and simulation results are provided to assess the gap between the decentralized network performance and its equivalent virtual multiple input multiple output system, which is shown to be zero in some cases and relatively small in general.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power allocation games for mimo multiple access channels with coordination","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2009.081182","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5089942/05089999.pdf","startPage":"3182","endPage":"3192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2009.081182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5089942","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5089999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5089999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"23 June 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2009","displayDocTitle":"Power allocation games for mimo multiple access channels with coordination","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5089999/","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2009","publicationDate":"June 2009","accessionNumber":"10731356","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power allocation games for mimo multiple access channels with coordination","sourcePdf":"3182-tw0906-belmega.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116393S","chronDate":"June  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5089942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5089942","articleId":"5089999","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-05"}]
