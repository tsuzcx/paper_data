Binary encoding schema is used for chromosomes while encoding the multi-objective GA. In this case it encodes the variable length numbers of clusters. Fuzzy Relational Clustering method is used to automatically assign the membership to all data point for each cluster and it produce a clusters for the given microarray cancer dataset.

The progress of handwritten Bangla numeral is well behind Roman, Chinese and Arabic scripts although it is a major language in Indian subcontinent and is the first language of Bangladesh. Handwritten numeral classification is a high-dimensional complex task and existing methods use distinct feature extraction techniques and various classification tools in their recognition schemes. Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) is found efficient for image classification with its distinct features. In this study, a CNN based method has been investigated for Bangla handwritten numeral recognition. A moderated pre-processing has been adopted to produce patterns from handwritten scan images. On the other hand, CNN has been trained with the patterns plus a number of artificial patterns. A simple rotation based approach is employed to generate artificial patterns.

Major research areas in MCC are how, where and when to offload a task from mobile devices to cloud. Servers have to be selected very carefully to offload a task to ensure users' enhanced quality of experience which becomes more complex due to different limitations of wireless networks (i.e., network inconsistency, collision, etc.).

In various studies, DAS based networks with uniformly distributed users have been shown to yield higher capacity and reliability. However, to the best of our knowledge, non-uniform user distribution has not been taken into account in previous research on DAS. In light of this, this paper proposes and investigates various network layouts incorporating DASs, including uniform and non-uniformly distributed AEs and BSs. Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP) are utilized for modeling the locations of users, AEs and BSs. Performance of the proposed network layouts are evaluated in terms of downlink signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) and outage probability using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Comparison of these metrics with those of the conventional uniformly distributed AEs demonstrates the superiority of the proposed non-uniform deployment of network elements.","doi":"10.1109/ICIEV.2016.7760120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIEV.2016.7760120","startPage":"839","endPage":"843","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 5th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision (ICIEV)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7746853/7759964/07760120.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 5th International Conference on Informatics, Electronics and Vision (ICIEV)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7759964","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink analysis of cellular networks with distributed antenna systems for non-uniform user distribution using stochastic geometry","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Downlink analysis of cellular networks with distributed antenna systems for non-uniform user distribution using stochastic geometry","conferenceDate":"13-14 May 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760120/","accessionNumber":"16504486","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760120/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink analysis of cellular networks with distributed antenna systems for non-uniform user distribution using stochastic geometry","confLoc":"Dhaka, Bangladesh","sourcePdf":"553.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043348S","chronDate":"13-14 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7746853","isNumber":"7759964","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7746853","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7759964","articleId":"7760120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7760136,"authors":[{"name":"Sadiqur Rahaman","affiliation":["University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Sadiqur","lastName":"Rahaman","id":"37086075001"},{"name":"Shahnewaz Shahabuddin","affiliation":["University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Shahnewaz","lastName":"Shahabuddin","id":"37086203018"},{"name":"Md Belayat Hossain","affiliation":["University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Md Belayat","lastName":"Hossain","id":"37086210087"},{"name":"Shahriar Shahabuddin","affiliation":["University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Shahriar","lastName":"Shahabuddin","id":"37076108300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1269-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1270-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7760136","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"abstract":"MIMO is a key technology to achieve the thousand fold data rate requirement for next generation communication system.

Thus, for efficient estimation of the actual signal, the sensing matrix must preserve the relative distances among the underlying sparse vectors. Provided this condition is fulfilled, we show that CS samples will also preserve the envelope of the actual signal. Exploiting this envelope preserving property of CS samples, we propose a new fast method which is able to extract prototype signals from compressive samples for efficient sparse representation and recovery of signals. These prototype signals are orthogonal intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) extracted from CS samples using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which is one of the popular methods to capture the envelope of a signal. The extracted IMFs are used to seed the dictionary without even comprehending the original signal or the sensing matrix. Moreover, one can update the dictionary on-line as new CS samples are available. In particularly, to recover first L signals (\u03f5 R\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sup>\n) at the decoder, one can seed the dictionary in just O(nL log n) operations, that is far less as compared to existing approaches.

Knowledge of propagation path parameters such as complex channel gain, propagation delay or angle-of-arrival provides valuable information on the user position and facilitates channel response estimation. A major challenge in channel parameter estimation lies in its multidimensional nature, which leads to large-scale estimation problems which are difficult to solve. Current approaches of sparse recovery for multidimensional parameter estimation aim at simultaneously estimating all channel parameters by solving one large-scale estimation problem. In contrast to that we propose a sparse recovery method which relies on decomposing the multidimensional problem into successive one-dimensional parameter estimation problems, which are much easier to solve and less sensitive to off-grid effects, while providing proper parameter pairing. Our proposed decomposition relies on convex optimization in terms of nuclear norm minimization and we present an efficient implementation in terms of the recently developed STELA algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760211","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760211.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760211","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","startPage":"66","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional sparse recovery for MIMO channel parameter estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760211","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional sparse recovery for MIMO channel parameter estimation","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760211/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503157","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760211/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional sparse recovery for MIMO channel parameter estimation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570252132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059804S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7760212,"authors":[{"name":"Susanne Sparrer","affiliation":["Institute of Communications Engineering, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany"],"firstName":"Susanne","lastName":"Sparrer","id":"37085653381"},{"name":"Robert F.H.

However, in many applications such as sensor networks, the elements of the vector to be estimated are discrete-valued or from a finite set. Hence, specialized algorithms which perform the reconstruction with respect to this additional knowledge are required. Starting from the well-known iterative hard thresholding algorithm, a new algorithm is developed. To this end, knowledge from communications engineering is transferred to Compressed Sensing, resulting in a powerful though low-complexity algorithm. Via numerical results the benefit of the proposed algorithm is covered.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760212","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760212.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"75","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760212","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced iterative hard thresholding for the estimation of discrete-valued sparse signals","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760212/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503233","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760212/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced iterative hard thresholding for the estimation of discrete-valued sparse signals","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570252137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073892S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760212","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7760223,"authors":[{"name":"Hui Zhuang","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Zhuang","id":"37086201024"},{"name":"Jintao Li","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jintao","lastName":"Li","id":"37086206174"},{"name":"Weibiao Geng","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weibiao","lastName":"Geng","id":"37086203253"},{"name":"Xiaoming Dai","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Dai","id":"37537845200"},{"name":"Zhongshan Zhang","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering and Technology Research Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, University of Science and Technology Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279639900"},{"name":"Athanasios V.

However, a severe self-interference (SI) due to the large difference between the power of the devices' own transmission and that of the signal of interest may be imposed on the FD based devices, thus significantly eroding the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To implement the FD devices, the SI power must be sufficiently suppressed to provide a high-enough received SINR for satisfying the decoding requirement. In this paper, the design and implementation of the duplexer for facilitating SI cancellation in FD based devices are investigated, with a new type of duplexer (i.e. an improved directional coupler) designed and verified. It is shown that the SI suppression capability may be up to 36 dB by using the proposed design, which is much higher than that attainable in the commonly designed ferrite circulator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760223/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760223/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503182","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Duplexer design and implementation for self-interference cancellation in full-duplex communications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Duplexer design and implementation for self-interference cancellation in full-duplex communications","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570245863.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048395S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760223","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7760224,"authors":[{"name":"Flavio Zabini","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna"],"firstName":"Flavio","lastName":"Zabini","id":"37295109700"},{"name":"Alex Calisti","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Calisti","id":"37085482442"},{"name":"Davide Dardari","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna"],"firstName":"Davide","lastName":"Dardari","id":"37271336300"},{"name":"Andrea Conti","affiliation":["ENDIF, University of Ferrara"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Conti","id":"37266585500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760224","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":122},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrostatic discharges","Estimation","Large scale integration","Wireless sensor networks","Distortion","Measurement errors","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interpolation","mean square error methods","power consumption","signal sampling","stochastic processes","telecommunication power management","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","random sampling","estimation accuracy","energy consumption","spatial process","sparse sensing nodes","environmental monitoring","crowd-sourcing","measurement errors","finite-energy signal sampling","finite d-dimensional space","homogeneous Poisson point process","optimal linear space invariant interpolator","signal energy spectral density","normalized estimation mean square error","asymptotic analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760224","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760224","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760224.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"134","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random sampling via sensor networks: Estimation accuracy vs. energy consumption","abstract":"The estimation of spatial processes from sparse sensing nodes is fundamental for many applications, including environmental monitoring and crowd-sourcing.

The complexity of this SRLS algorithm is significantly lower than the PAPA complexity. However, its identification performance (the same as the PAPA performance) does not approach that of the oracle SRLS algorithm. We propose here a new version of the SRLS-VDL algorithm that does achieve next-to-oracle performance. We arrive at this algorithm by minimizing the least squares cost function with a penalty. We also propose a modified penalty that takes into account both the sparsity of the unknown system and additive noise. Numerical results with speech signals in an acoustic echo cancellation scenario show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other sparse estimation techniques and its performance is close to the oracle performance.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","startPage":"145","endPage":"149","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760227.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760227","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse sliding-window RLS adaptive filter with dynamic regularization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Complexity theory","Loading","Cost function","Europe","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","adaptive filters","echo suppression","least squares approximations","minimisation","recursive filters","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse sliding-window RLS adaptive filter","dynamic regularization","time-varying diagonal loading","tap-varying diagonal loading","proportionate affine projection algorithm","PAPA","sparse identification","SRLS-VDL algorithm","least square cost function minimization","acoustic echo cancellation scenario","speech signal"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sparse sliding-window RLS adaptive filter with dynamic regularization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760227/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760227/","accessionNumber":"16503328","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sparse sliding-window RLS adaptive filter with dynamic regularization","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570245965.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088746S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760227","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7760231,"authors":[{"name":"Kaspars Ozols","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Kaspars","lastName":"Ozols","id":"38527364900"},{"name":"Rolands Shavelis","affiliation":["Institute of Electronics and Computer Science, Riga, Latvia"],"firstName":"Rolands","lastName":"Shavelis","id":"37568148400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760231","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":31},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Sigma-delta modulation","Modulation","Encoding","Switching circuits","Energy consumption","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","sigma-delta modulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude adaptive asynchronous sigma-delta modulator scheme","amplitude adaptive ASDM","envelope encoding","time varying envelope function"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760231","abstract":"In this paper a method of encoding the signals by using Amplitude Adaptive Asynchronous Sigma-Delta modulator (AA-ASDM) scheme without an additional envelope encoding of the signal is proposed. According to AA-ASDM, the time-varying envelope function of the input signal is used in the feedback loop to reduce the switching rate of the output trigger and thus the power consumption of the circuit. In previous work, the signal and its envelope function were encoded and transmitted separately, thus resulting in inefficiency, since two signals instead of one were required to be transmitted. In order to solve this inefficiency, in this paper it is proposed to select such a time-varying envelope function which does not require additional encoding and transmission, and still be able to recover the original signal from the obtained time sequence. The proposed method is particularly advantageous for signals with wide dynamic range.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760231","startPage":"165","endPage":"169","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760231.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Amplitude adaptive ASDM without envelope encoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Amplitude adaptive ASDM without envelope encoding","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760231/","accessionNumber":"16503147","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760231/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplitude adaptive ASDM without envelope encoding","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570251872.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045012S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760244,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio G.

We also show that Tomlinson-Harashima precoding only outperforms optimized linear precoding when the channel state information is almost perfectly known.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760256.pdf","endPage":"294","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensitivity of nonlinear precoding to imperfect channel state information in G.fast","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760256","startPage":"290","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sensitivity of nonlinear precoding to imperfect channel state information in G.fast","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760256/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16539824","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760256/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensitivity of nonlinear precoding to imperfect channel state information in G.fast","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064409S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760257,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad A.

At these higher frequencies, the indirect channels produced by the electromagnetic coupling (EMC) between pairs in a binder cable may be as strong as, or stronger than, the direct channels. In this work, we exploit the isomorphism between this wireline environment and the well-studied multipath wireless models to propose a full duplex wired MIMO system for the legacy copper connection in a point-to-point backhaul network. The proposed system achieves self-interference suppression and exploitation of the diversity offered by the EMC channels through a joint interoperable precoding scheme consisting of null space projection (NSP) and maximum ratio combining (MRC). Channel measurements for a 10 pair binder cable are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed system.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760257/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16503325","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760257/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bi-directional beamforming bit error ratio analysis for wireline backhaul networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bi-directional beamforming bit error ratio analysis for wireline backhaul networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067479S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760257","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760258,"authors":[{"name":"Avi Zanko","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Avi","lastName":"Zanko","id":"38234778900"},{"name":"Itsik Bergel","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Itsik","lastName":"Bergel","id":"37284754000"},{"name":"Amir Leshem","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel"],"firstName":"Amir","lastName":"Leshem","id":"37284802600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760258","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760258","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","Convergence","Signal processing algorithms","Signal to noise ratio","DSL","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk","digital subscriber lines","least mean squares methods","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gigabit DSL","deep-LMS approach","crosstalk cancellation","adaptive non-diagonal preprocessing matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Crosstalk canceler","DSL","LMS","G.fast"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we present the Deep-LMS, a novel algorithm for crosstalk cancellation in DSL. The Deep-LMS crosstalk canceler uses an adaptive non-diagonal preprocessing matrix prior to a conventional LMS crosstalk canceler. The role of the preprocessing matrix is to speed-up the convergence of the conventional LMS crosstalk canceler and hence speed-up the convergence of the overall system. The update of the preprocessing matrix is inspired by deep neural networks. However, since all the operations in the Deep-LMS algorithm are linear, we are capable of providing an exact convergence speed analysis. The Deep-LMS is important for crosstalk cancellation in the novel G.fast standard, where traditional LMS converges very slowly due to the large bandwidth. Simulation results support our analysis and show significant reduction in convergence time compared to existing LMS variants.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760258","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760258.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"304","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760258","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gigabit DSL: A deep-LMS approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Gigabit DSL: A deep-LMS approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760258/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503150","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760258/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gigabit DSL: A deep-LMS approach","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054746S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760270,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Schnier","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Schnier","id":"37085713807"},{"name":"Carsten Bockelmann","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Carsten","lastName":"Bockelmann","id":"37568999500"},{"name":"Armin Dekorsy","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Dekorsy","id":"37284963100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760270","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sparse matrices","Reed-Solomon codes","Decoding","Signal processing algorithms","Loss measurement","Compressed sensing","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","compressed sensing","decoding","error correction codes","matrix algebra","Reed-Solomon codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum measurement deterministic compressed sensing","complex Reed Solomon decoding","CS recovery algorithm","long sparse vector measurement","channel coding","measurement matrix","error correction scheme","generalized Reed-Solomon encoding-decoding structure","sparsely representable vector measure","fitting basis","lossless reconstruction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed Sensing","Reed Solomon","Deterministic","Sparsity"]}],"abstract":"Compressed Sensing (CS) is an emerging field in communications and mathematics that is used to measure few measurements of long sparse vectors with the ability of lossless reconstruction.

In this paper, we apply CS to 3-D surface acquisition using Sheet-of-Light (SOL) scanning. The application of CS could potentially increase the speed of the measurement and/or enhance scan resolution with fewer measurements. To analyze the potential performance of a CS-SOL system, we formulate the estimation of the height profile of a target object as a compressive parameter estimation problem and investigate the achievable estimation accuracy in the presence of noise. In the context of compressed sensing, measurement models with AWGN are typically analyzed. However, in imaging applications there are multiple noise sources giving rise to different statistical noise models in which Poisson noise can be the dominating noise source. This is particularly true for photon-counting detectors that are used in low light settings. Therefore, in this paper we focus on the compressive parameter estimation problem in presence of Poisson distributed photon noise. The achievable estimation accuracy in obtaining height profiles from compressed observations is systematically analyzed with the help of the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB). This analysis allows us to compare different CS measurement strategies and quantify the parameter estimation accuracy as a function of system parameters such as the compression ratio, exposure time, image size, etc.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760289","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760289.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760289","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On poisson compressed sensing and parameter estimation in sheet-of-light surface scanning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760289","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760289/","displayDocTitle":"On poisson compressed sensing and parameter estimation in sheet-of-light surface scanning","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16539754","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760289/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On poisson compressed sensing and parameter estimation in sheet-of-light surface scanning","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570255783.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082124S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760289","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760290,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Roemer","affiliation":["Praunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Ilmenau, Germany","Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Institute for Information Technology"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Roemer","id":"37295437800"},{"name":"Mohamed Ibrahim","affiliation":["Praunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Ilmenau, Germany","Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Institute for Information Technology"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Ibrahim","id":"37085618284"},{"name":"Norbert Franke","affiliation":["Praunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Franke","id":"37085662718"},{"name":"Niels Hadaschik","affiliation":["Praunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Niels","lastName":"Hadaschik","id":"37425853400"},{"name":"Andreas Eidloth","affiliation":["Praunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Eidloth","id":"37595946200"},{"name":"Benjamin Sackenreuter","affiliation":["Praunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Sackenreuter","id":"37085651783"},{"name":"Giovanni Del Galdo","affiliation":["Praunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits IIS, Ilmenau, Germany","Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Institute for Information Technology"],"firstName":"Giovanni","lastName":"Del Galdo","id":"37427000100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760290","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":226},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Kernel","Estimation","Synchronization","Delay estimation","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","delay estimation","frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["measurement matrix design","compressed sensing","time delay estimation","measurement kernels","frequency-domain representation","delay estimation accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive sensing","synchronization","delay estimation","measurement matrix design"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we study the problem of estimating the unknown delay(s) in a system where we receive a linear combination of several delayed copies of a known transmitted waveform.

We highlight the theoretical recovery guarantee of the proposed approach and we demonstrate, via simulation results, its reliability in cancelling out the effect of the outlying saturated measurements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On quantized compressed sensing with saturated measurements via convex optimization","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760292","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760292.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760292","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760292","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760292/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"On quantized compressed sensing with saturated measurements via convex optimization","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760292/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503415","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On quantized compressed sensing with saturated measurements via convex optimization","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570255933.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070896S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760292","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760293,"authors":[{"name":"Ines Elleuch","affiliation":["SUP'COM, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Ines","lastName":"Elleuch","id":"37073376000"},{"name":"Fatma Abdelkefi","affiliation":["SUP'COM, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Fatma","lastName":"Abdelkefi","id":"38478613200"},{"name":"Mohamed Siala","affiliation":["SUP'COM, University of Carthage, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Siala","id":"37085354625"},{"name":"Ridha Hamila","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Qatar University, Qatar"],"firstName":"Ridha","lastName":"Hamila","id":"37282475100"},{"name":"Naofal Al-Dhahir","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Texas, Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Naofal","lastName":"Al-Dhahir","id":"37269044000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760293","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of sparse signal recovery from scalar quantized compressed sensing measurements, via optimization.

The transmission of quantum bits alongside intense classical signals on the same fiber faces major challenges arising from the background noise generated by classical channels. Raman scattering, in particular, is shown to have detrimental effects on the performance of quantum key distribution systems. Here, by using a nearly optimal wavelength allocation technique, we minimize the Raman induced background noise on quantum channels, hence maximize the achievable secret key generation rate for quantum channels. It turns out the conventional solution that would involve splitting the spectrum into only two bands, one for quantum and one for classical channels, is only a suboptimal one. We show that, in our optimal arrangement, we might need several quantum and classical bands interspersed among each other.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760295","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760295.pdf","startPage":"483","endPage":"487","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760295","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal wavelength allocation in hybrid quantum-classical networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760295","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760295/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal wavelength allocation in hybrid quantum-classical networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517713","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760295/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal wavelength allocation in hybrid quantum-classical networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088782S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760295","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760297,"authors":[{"name":"Yixuan Xie","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Yixuan","lastName":"Xie","id":"37594158000"},{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Li","id":"37598871100"},{"name":"Robert Malaney","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Malaney","id":"37282041100"},{"name":"Jinhong Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Jinhong","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37281352700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760297","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760297","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Channel estimation","Noise level","Silicon","Error correction codes","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum LDPC decoding","misidentified quantum depolarization channel","channel mismatch effect","channel noise","depolarization flip parameter"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved quantum LDPC decoding strategies for the misidentified quantum depolarization channel","startPage":"493","endPage":"497","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760297.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760297","abstract":"In this work, the importance of the channel mismatch effect in degrading the performance of deployed quantum LDPC codes has been pointed out.

Because many different types of wheels can be manufactured, it is proposed to detect any anomaly using a general and original adaptive linear parametric model. The adaptivity of the proposed model allows us to describe accurately the inspected wheel surface. In addition, the use of a linear parametric model allows the application of hypothesis testing theory to design a test whose statistical performances are analytically known.

In this paper we focus on the product of probability density functions, and more specifically on the Inverse Generalized Gaussian distribution [10].

We show that the Mellin statistics framework can provide some enlightments about this probability density function family, and can clearly link the Mellin convolution pdf family and the product pdf family.

AMP is an iterative algorithm that performs image reconstruction through image denoising within a compressive sampling framework. In this work, our aim is to evaluate the merits of several combinations of a denoiser and a transform domain, which are the two main factors that determine the recovery performance. In particular, we investigate reconstruction performance in the spatial, DCT, and wavelet domains. We compare the results with existing reconstruction algorithms already used in ultrasound imaging and quantify the performance improvement.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Discrete cosine transforms","Signal processing algorithms","Ultrasonic imaging","Image coding","Wavelet domain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","compressed sensing","discrete cosine transforms","image denoising","image reconstruction","iterative methods","medical image processing","message passing","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sampling reconstruction","biomedical ultrasonic images","approximate message passing algorithm","AMP algorithm","iterative algorithm","image reconstruction","image denoising","transform domain","spatial domains","DCT domains","wavelet domains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ultrasonic images","Compressive Sampling","nonconvex optimization","IRLS","AMP","image denoising"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760310","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760310.pdf","startPage":"557","endPage":"561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760310","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrasound image reconstruction from compressed measurements using approximate message passing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Ultrasound image reconstruction from compressed measurements using approximate message passing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760310/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760310/","accessionNumber":"16503122","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrasound image reconstruction from compressed measurements using approximate message passing","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056847S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7760311,"authors":[{"name":"Marko Pani\u0107","affiliation":["University of Novi Sad, BioSense Institute"],"firstName":"Marko","lastName":"Pani\u0107","id":"38548450900"},{"name":"Jan Aelterman","affiliation":["Department Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Aelterman","id":"37396105900"},{"name":"Vladimir Crnojevi\u0107","affiliation":["University of Novi Sad, BioSense Institute"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Crnojevi\u0107"},{"name":"Aleksandra Pi\u017eurica","affiliation":["Department Telecommunications and Information Processing, Ghent University"],"firstName":"Aleksandra","lastName":"Pi\u017eurica","id":"37295254100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760311","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":130},"abstract":"Recent work in compressed sensing of magnetic resonance images (CS-MRI) concentrates on encoding structured sparsity in acquisition or in the reconstruction stages. Subband coefficients of typical images obey a certain structure, which can be viewed in terms of fixed groups (like wavelet trees) or statistically (certain configurations are more likely than others). Approaches using wavelet tree-sparsity have already demonstrated excellent performance in MRI. However, the use of statistical models for spatial clustering of the subband coefficients has not been studied well in CS-MRI yet, although the potentials of such an approach have been indicated. In this paper, we design a practical reconstruction algorithm as a variant of the proximal splitting methods, making use of a Markov Random Field prior model for spatial clustering of subband coefficients. The results for different undersampling patterns demonstrate an improved reconstruction performance compared to both standard CS-MRI methods and methods based on wavelet tree sparsity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760311.pdf","startPage":"562","endPage":"566","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760311","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressed sensing in MRI with a Markov random field prior for spatial clustering of subband coefficients","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Signal processing algorithms","Image reconstruction","Markov random fields","Inference algorithms","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","compressed sensing","image reconstruction","Markov processes","trees (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","magnetic resonance images","CS-MRI methods","Markov random field","spatial clustering","subband coefficients","wavelet tree-sparsity","proximal splitting methods","undersampling patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Compressed sensing in MRI with a Markov random field prior for spatial clustering of subband coefficients","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760311/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503115","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressed sensing in MRI with a Markov random field prior for spatial clustering of subband coefficients","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256318.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084317S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760324,"authors":[{"name":"Bo Peng","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Peng","id":"38469531400"},{"name":"Pierluigi Salvo Rossi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Pierluigi Salvo","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37271856800"},{"name":"Hefeng Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Hefeng","lastName":"Dong","id":"37540152000"},{"name":"Kimmo Kansanen","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Telecommunications, Norwegian University of Science and Technology"],"firstName":"Kimmo","lastName":"Kansanen","id":"37281872600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760324","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":227},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Digital signal processing","OFDM","Receivers","Channel estimation","Random access memory","Underwater acoustics","Matching pursuit algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","time-varying channels","underwater acoustic communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DSP based OFDM receiver","time-varying underwater acoustic channels","digital signal processor based iterative orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","time-varying underwater acoustic channels","basis expansion model","time-varying channel","orthogonal matching pursuit","fast Fourier transform","FFT based low-complexity","OMP algorithm","computational complexity","multicore DSP evaluation module","TMDX-EVM6678L","system performance","frequency 1 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater acoustic communication","DSP","Iterative receiver","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a digital signal processor (DSP) based iterative orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) receiver for time-varying underwater acoustic channels.

It is mainly based on the finite rate of innovation (FRI) characteristic of UWB channel impulse response, which allows for a sampling frequency much lower than the Nyquist limit. Since the UWB channel is rich in multipaths, the number of samples required results in an unrealistic number of processing channels. Our approach removes this drawback at the price of a moderate increase of the number of pilot pulses. Compared to other schemes presented in the literature, the one proposed in this paper allows reducing the number of processing channels to values appropriate for practical implementation. Moreover, the same approach is used to further reduce the sampling frequency at each channel.

The results indicate the proposed function approximation technique as a powerful approach for the design of direct digital frequency synthesizers with spurious free dynamic ranges of 90dBc and more.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760333","startPage":"672","endPage":"676","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760333.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On high-accuracy direct digital frequency synthesis using linear function approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"On high-accuracy direct digital frequency synthesis using linear function approximation","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760333/","accessionNumber":"16503406","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760333/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On high-accuracy direct digital frequency synthesis using linear function approximation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570254555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076747S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760333","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760338,"authors":[{"name":"Mamadou Lamarana Diallo","affiliation":["SCEE, IETR, Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Mamadou Lamarana","lastName":"Diallo","id":"37085799297"},{"name":"Marwa Chafii","affiliation":["SCEE, IETR, Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Marwa","lastName":"Chafii","id":"37085341339"},{"name":"Jacques Palicot","affiliation":["SCEE, IETR, Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jacques","lastName":"Palicot","id":"37269478700"},{"name":"Faouzi Bader","affiliation":["SCEE, IETR, Cesson S\u00e9vign\u00e9, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Faouzi","lastName":"Bader","id":"37282298800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760338","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":292},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Frequency modulation","Complexity theory","Matrix decomposition","Optimization","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","gradient methods","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modified tone reservation","PAPR reduction","OFDM systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplex modulation","peak-to-average power ratio","power efficiency","power amplifier","PAPR mitigation","peak cancelling signal design","time domain","computational complexity","TR method","gradient projection algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","PAPR","Tone Reservation","CCDF"]}],"abstract":"One of the main drawbacks of orthogonal frequency division multiplex modulation is its high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which can induce poor power efficiency at high power amplifier. Tone reservation (TR) is the most popular PAPR mitigation technique that uses a set of reserved tones to design peak cancelling signal for PAPR reduction. Finding an effective peak cancelling for PAPR reduction in the time domain by using only a small number of reserved tones, is not straightforward. Therefore, we are led to a trade-off between computational complexity and PAPR reduction. The TR method based on the gradient projection algorithm gives the best compromise. In this paper, we propose to modify the classical TR structure. The new proposed method achieves an improvement up to 1.2 dB in terms of PAPR performance without increasing the complexity. The effectiveness of this solution is confirmed through theoretical analysis and simulation results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified tone reservation for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760338","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760338.pdf","startPage":"697","endPage":"701","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760338/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Modified tone reservation for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760338/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503163","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified tone reservation for PAPR reduction in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099923S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760348,"authors":[{"name":"Jani Saloranta","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jani","lastName":"Saloranta","id":"37298232100"},{"name":"Giuseppe Destino","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Destino","id":"37298698900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760348","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Dictionaries","Antennas","Europe","Signal processing","Receivers","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave propagation","microwave receivers","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters","sparse matrices","telecommunication signalling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO-OFDM channel sparsity utilization","sparsity structure","angular information delay","angular propagation delay","radio transmitter","radio receiver","scatter device","single base-station localization algorithm","pilot signalling","OFDM transmission","adaptive-LASSO optimization method","\u21131-based minimization problem","sparse matrix","sparse vector","ray-tracing channel model","frequency 28 GHz"]}],"abstract":"Recent results have revealed that MIMO channels at high carrier frequencies exhibit sparsity structure, i.e., a few dominant propagation paths.

The composite of these two timely concepts is a promising candidate technology for emerging 5G systems since the GFDM waveform is advantageous to flexible spectrum use whereas full-duplex operation can significantly improve spectral efficiency. The main technical challenge in full-duplex transceivers at large is to mitigate their inherent self-interference due to simultaneous transmission and reception. In the case of GFDM that is non-orthogonal by design, interference cancellation becomes even more challenging since the interfering signal is subject to intricate coupling between all subchannels. Thus, we first develop a sophisticated frequency-domain cancellation architecture for removing all the self-interference components. Furthermore, by exploiting the specific structure of the interference pattern, we further modify the scheme into one that allows flexible control and reduction of computational complexity.

Then, the users in the UL channel send their independent information to the BS using their harvested energy in the second phase. Since the utility function of the sum rate maximization is nonconvex, and thus, the optimal solution is difficult to find in general.

It relies on the use a large number of antennas at the base-station to improve network performance. The performance of massive MIMO systems is often limited by imperfect channel estimation because of pilot contamination. Recently, several channel estimation techniques have been proposed to minimize the performance degradation. However, the assessment of these techniques in the literature has often been conducted considering standard channel models, like the independent Rayleigh fading model and Clarke's multipath model, which do not consider spatial correlation. In this work, we investigate different channel models used and proposed for massive MIMO transmission and, through numerical studies, highlight their effect on the performance of the aforementioned channel estimation techniques. Based on this we recommend the use of channel models that capture the spatial correlation between antennas and different user channels.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760363","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760363.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","startPage":"823","endPage":"827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of channel models and channel estimation techniques for massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760363","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the use of channel models and channel estimation techniques for massive MIMO systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760363/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16539766","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760363/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of channel models and channel estimation techniques for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570255217.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065996S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760368,"authors":[{"name":"Leyuan Pan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Leyuan","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085545679"},{"name":"Yongyu Dai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Yongyu","lastName":"Dai","id":"37085459070"},{"name":"Xiaodai Dong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Xiaodai","lastName":"Dong","id":"37281247500"},{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xu","id":"37536681300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760368","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","MIMO","Coherence","Uplink","Downlink","Interference","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","interference suppression","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","relay networks (telecommunication)","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipair massive MIMO relaying system performance","multipair massive multiple-input multiple-output relaying system","block-shifted pilot scheme design","pilot transmission overhead reduction","channel estimation overhead reduction","limited coherence time interval length","data transmission","massive MIMO channel asymptotic orthogonality","pilot-data interference suppression","block-shifted transmission pattern"]}],"abstract":"We propose a design of block-shifted pilot scheme for the multipair massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relaying system. The proposed scheme balances the tradeoff between pilot transmission overhead and channel estimation accuracy in scenarios with limited length of coherence time interval, and thereby the system performance is dramatically improved. In the proposed scheme, pilots are properly designed so that they can be transmitted simultaneously with data to decrease channel estimation overheads. By exploiting the asymptotic orthogonality of massive MIMO channels, the source data can be exactly detected from the received signal, and then pilot-data interference can be effectively suppressed with assistance of the detected data in the destination channel estimation. In the block-shifted transmission pattern, the effective data transmission period is extended to improve system throughput. Both theoretical and numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed scheme to conventional ones in limited coherence time interval scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760368","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760368.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","startPage":"848","endPage":"852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel block-shifted pilot design for multipair massive MIMO relaying","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A novel block-shifted pilot design for multipair massive MIMO relaying","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760368/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503289","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760368/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel block-shifted pilot design for multipair massive MIMO relaying","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570257663.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064233S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760395,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Weiss Hansen","affiliation":["AD:MT, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Martin Weiss","lastName":"Hansen","id":"37085418325"},{"name":"Jesper Rindom Jensen","affiliation":["AD:MT, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Jesper Rindom","lastName":"Jensen","id":"37271733000"},{"name":"Mads Gr\u00e6sb\u00f8ll Christensen","affiliation":["AD:MT, Aalborg University, Denmark"],"firstName":"Mads Gr\u00e6sb\u00f8ll","lastName":"Christensen","id":"37560629200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760395","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760395","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Frequency estimation","Instruments","Estimation","Cost function","Matching pursuit algorithms","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio recording","estimation theory","least squares approximations","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio recordings","multipitch estimation","codebook-based approach","single-channel mixtures","harmonic signals","overlapping harmonics amplitudes","ill-posed problem","extended invariance principle","realistic amplitude vectors","nonlinear least squares cost function","NLS cost function","fundamental frequency","synthetic mixtures","real mixtures"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-pitch estimation","amplitude estimation","vector quantization","music information retrieval"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760395","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760395.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"987","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-pitch estimation of audio recordings using a codebook-based approach","abstract":"In this paper, a method for multi-pitch estimation of single-channel mixtures of harmonic signals is presented.

Standard blind source separation methods cannot be used because the relative microphone positions change over time and some of them are occasionally shaded by rubble. To solve these problems, we develop a Bayesian model that separates multichannel amplitude spectrograms into sparse and low-rank components (human voice and noise) without using phase information, which depends on the array layout. The voice level at each microphone is estimated in a time-varying manner for reducing the influence of the shaded microphones.

Although op-amps are essential to many circuits and deviations from ideal can be important, previous WDF research applies only to the limited case of circuits with ideal op-amps, in differential amplifier topology, with no global feedback.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760405","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760405.pdf","startPage":"1033","endPage":"1037","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wave digital filter modeling of circuits with operational amplifiers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Wave digital filter modeling of circuits with operational amplifiers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760405/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517725","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760405/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wave digital filter modeling of circuits with operational amplifiers","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570255463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077457S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7760407,"authors":[{"name":"Fabi\u00e1n Esqueda","affiliation":["Dept.

Digital implementations of saturating systems introduce harmonic distortion which, if untreated, gets reflected at the Nyquist limit and is mixed with the signal. This is called aliasing and is heard as a disturbance. A new correction function, derived by integrating the bandlimited ramp function, is presented. This function reduces the level of aliasing distortion seen at the output of soft clippers by quasi-bandlimiting the discontinuities introduced in the second derivative of the signal. The proposed method increases the quality of the signal by attenuating those aliased components that lie on the lower end of the spectrum, which are known to be perceptually important. The four-point version of the algorithm reduces aliasing at low frequencies by up to about 50 dB. This work extends our understanding of aliasing in nonlinear systems and provides a new tool for its suppression in virtual analog models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760407/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503383","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Antialiased soft clipping using an integrated bandlimited ramp","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Antialiased soft clipping using an integrated bandlimited ramp","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050653S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760407","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7760414,"authors":[{"name":"Pantelis Sopasakis","affiliation":["IMT Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca, Lucca, Italy"],"firstName":"Pantelis","lastName":"Sopasakis","id":"38548002400"},{"name":"Nikolaos Freris","affiliation":["Division of Engineering, New York University Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Freris","id":"38597035200"},{"name":"Panagiotis Patrinos","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engineering (ESAT-STADIUS), OPTEC, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Patrinos","id":"38233038100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760414","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760414","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Compressed sensing","Convergence","Newton method","Signal processing","Acceleration","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","data compression","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerated reconstruction","compressively sampled data stream","compressed sensing approach","noisy measurements","Newton-type forward- backward proximal method","least-squares problem","quadratic convergence rate","signal processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","operator splitting methods","recursive algorithms","LASSO","Forward Backward Splitting"]}],"abstract":"The traditional compressed sensing approach is naturally offline, in that it amounts to sparsely sampling and reconstructing a given dataset.

In this paper, we develop a novel Newton-type forward-backward proximal method to recursively solve the regularized Least-Squares problem (LASSO) online.

However, huge computational complexities and communication overheads impede many of these algorithms from being useful in practice. In this paper, we propose a low-footprint optimization approach to reduce the convergence time and overheads for the distributed beamforming problem. We transcribe the pseudo-coherence-based beamforming which is insightful for taking into account the nature of speech. We formulate the distributed minimum variance distortionless response beamformer using the primal-dual method of multipliers. Our experiments confirm the fast convergence using the proposed distributed algorithm. It is also shown how a hard limit on the number of iterations affects the performance of the array in noise and interference suppression.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760416/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16503207","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760416/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Ad hoc microphone array beamforming using the primal-dual method of multipliers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ad hoc microphone array beamforming using the primal-dual method of multipliers","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256167.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058002S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7760421,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandros Iosifidis","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Iosifidis","id":"37601485000"},{"name":"Anastasios Tefas","affiliation":["Department of Informatics, Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Anastasios","lastName":"Tefas","id":"37299690600"},{"name":"Ioannis Pitas","affiliation":["Department Electrical & Electronic Engineering, University of Bristol, UK","Department of Informatics, Aristotle University, Thessaloniki, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Pitas","id":"37276557400"},{"name":"Moncef Gabbouj","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Moncef","lastName":"Gabbouj","id":"37276556200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760421","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Matrix decomposition","Media","Standards","Training","Data analysis","Time complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","Big Data","computational complexity","image recognition","learning (artificial intelligence)","matrix algebra","operating system kernels","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation method","kernel-based big media data analysis","image data set","video data set","standard pattern recognition approach","kernel matrix manipulation","kernel matrix storage","kernel-based learning approach","time complexity reduction","space complexity reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760421","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760421","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","abstract":"With the increasing size of today's image and video data sets, standard pattern recognition approaches, like kernel based learning, need to face new challenges.

Therefore, the cACGMM can better approximate the distribution of observed data, which is generally not rotationally symmetrical. In source separation simulations with real recorded impulse responses, the cACGMM resulted in an average 1.2 dB improvement of the Signal-to-Distortion Ratio (SDR) over the cWMM.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760429/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16539761","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760429/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Complex angular central Gaussian mixture model for directional statistics in mask-based microphone array signal processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex angular central Gaussian mixture model for directional statistics in mask-based microphone array signal processing","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256519.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07813S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7760432,"authors":[{"name":"Weichen Wang","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weichen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085865636"},{"name":"Ruohan Cao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruohan","lastName":"Cao","id":"38028640400"},{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403296700"},{"name":"Jian Zhou","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085564279"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760432","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium","Interference","Array signal processing","Receivers","Transmitters","Wireless communication","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","inductive power transmission","interference (signal)","optimisation","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure beamforming","artificial noise design","simultaneous wireless information","power transfer","interference networks","secure communication","energy receivers","artificial noise","optimization problem","second-order cone program","concave convex procedure based algorithm","SOCP problem"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760432","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760432","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","abstract":"We study a secure communication of a two-user interference network. In this network, two transmitters send information and artificial noise simultaneously to two users and energy receivers (ERs), and ERs are likely to perform as eavesdroppers. We propose a joint beamforming and artificial noise design to maximize the total energy harvested by ERs subject to the secrecy sum rate requirement and power constraints. The proposed design constitutes an optimization problem, which is non-convex yet can be further transformed into a two-stage problem. In the first stage, by introducing an auxiliary variable, we can reformulate the non-convex as a second-order cone program (SOCP) problem, and the constrained concave convex procedure based algorithm is proposed to make this SOCP problem tractable. In the second stage, the auxiliary variable is obtained by the one-dimensional line search. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","startPage":"1168","endPage":"1172","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760432.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secure beamforming and artificial noise design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in interference networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760432/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760432/","displayDocTitle":"Secure beamforming and artificial noise design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in interference networks","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503252","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secure beamforming and artificial noise design for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer in interference networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570250620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104802S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760432","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760435,"authors":[{"name":"Amel Tuama","affiliation":["LIRMM(UMR5506), MONTPELLIER UNIVERSITY/CNRS, Montpellier Cedex 5, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Amel","lastName":"Tuama","id":"37086044175"},{"name":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Comby","affiliation":["LIRMM(UMR5506), MONTPELLIER UNIVERSITY/CNRS, Montpellier Cedex 5, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric","lastName":"Comby","id":"37327034600"},{"name":"Marc Chaumont","affiliation":["LIRMM(UMR5506), MONTPELLIER UNIVERSITY/CNRS, Montpellier Cedex 5, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Chaumont","id":"37086046440"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760435","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":434},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Feature extraction","Image color analysis","Correlation","Colored noise","Interpolation","Discrete cosine transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","feature extraction","higher order statistics","image capture","learning (artificial intelligence)","optical filters","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine learning","high order statistics features","source camera identification methods","image capture","digital camera model identification","feature extraction","color filter array","conditional probability statistics","Dresden database","multiclass SVM classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Camera identification","Co-occurrences","CFA interpolation","Conditional Probability","SVM"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Camera model identification based machine learning approach with high order statistics features","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","endPage":"1187","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760435.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760435","startPage":"1183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760435","abstract":"Source camera identification methods aim at identifying the camera used to capture an image.

However, previous approaches, like multispace probability distribution hidden Markov models still surpass deep learning methods in the prediction accuracy of speech fundamental frequency (F0), inter alia, due to its discontinuous behavior. The current research focuses on the application of feedforward deep neural networks (DNNs) for modeling continuous F0 extracted by a recent vocoding technique. In order to achieve lower validation error, hyperparameter optimization with manual grid search was carried out. The results of objective and subjective evaluations show that using continuous F0 trajectories, DNNs can reach the modeling performance of previous state-of-the-art solutions. The complexity of DNN architectures could be reduced in case of continuous F0 contours as well.","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760468.pdf","startPage":"1348","endPage":"1352","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760468","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous fundamental frequency prediction with deep neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Continuous fundamental frequency prediction with deep neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760468/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760468/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16539759","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous fundamental frequency prediction with deep neural networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570252139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0995S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760469,"authors":[{"name":"Benjamin Elie","affiliation":["IADI, INSERM, Nancy, France","LORIA, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Elie","id":"37085572011"},{"name":"Yves Laprie","affiliation":["LORIA, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Laprie","id":"37352951200"},{"name":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Vuissoz","affiliation":["IADI, INSERM, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Pierre-Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Vuissoz","id":"37297817600"},{"name":"Freddy Odille","affiliation":["IADI, INSERM, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Freddy","lastName":"Odille","id":"37297814800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760469","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"abstract":"The paper presents a method to acquire articulatory data from a sequence of MRI images at a high framerate. The acquisition rate is enhanced by partially collecting data in the kt-space. The combination of compressed sensing technique, along with homodyne reconstruction, enables the missing data to be recovered. The good reconstruction is guaranteed by an appropriate design of the sampling pattern. It is based on a pseudo-random Cartesian scheme, where each line is partially acquired for use of the homodyne reconstruction, and where the lines are pseudo-randomly sampled: central lines are constantly acquired and the sampling density decreases as the lines are far from the center. Application on real speech data show that the framework enables dynamic sequences of vocal tract images to be recovered at a framerate higher than 30 frames per second and with a spatial resolution of 1 mm. A method to extract articulatory data from contour identification is presented. It is intended, in fine, to be used for the creation of a large database of articulatory data.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760469.pdf","startPage":"1353","endPage":"1357","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760469","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760469","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High spatiotemporal cineMRI films using compressed sensing for acquiring articulatory data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Magnetic resonance imaging","Speech","Coils","Compressed sensing","Europe","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical MRI","compressed sensing","data acquisition","edge detection","image reconstruction","image sampling","image sequences","medical image processing","speech processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speech production","articulatory data extraction","contour identification","dynamic vocal tract image sequences","sampling density","pseudo-random Cartesian scheme","sampling pattern","homodyne reconstruction","kt-space","MRI image sequence","articulatory data acquisition","compressed sensing technique","high spatiotemporal cineMRI films"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic speech MRI","Compressed Sensing","Articulatory data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760469/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"High spatiotemporal cineMRI films using compressed sensing for acquiring articulatory data","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760469/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503409","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High spatiotemporal cineMRI films using compressed sensing for acquiring articulatory data","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570252171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05084S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760469","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760471,"authors":[{"name":"J.

ULS formulations are easily reformulated as Unit-modulus Quadratic Programs (UQPs), to which Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR) can be applied, and is often the state-of-the-art approach. SDR has the drawback of squaring the number of variables, which lifts the problem to much higher dimension and renders SDR ill-suited for large-scale ULS/UQP. In this work, we propose first-order algorithms that meet or exceed SDR performance in terms of (approximately) solving ULS problems, and also exhibit much more favorable runtime performance relative to SDR. We specialize to phase-only beamformer design, which entails additional degrees of freedom that we point out and exploit in two custom algorithms that build upon the general first-order algorithm for ULS/UQP. Simulations are used to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760474/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16503143","htmlLink":"/document/7760474/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fast unit-modulus least squares with applications in transmit beamforming","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast unit-modulus least squares with applications in transmit beamforming","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570251990.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076891S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760475,"authors":[{"name":"Ryo Hayakawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Hayakawa","id":"37085801449"},{"name":"Kazunori Hayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazunori","lastName":"Hayashi","id":"37277906800"},{"name":"Hampei Sasahara","affiliation":["Engineering School, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hampei","lastName":"Sasahara","id":"37085492900"},{"name":"Masaaki Nagahara","affiliation":["Institute of Environmental Science and Technology, The University of Kitakyushu, Kitakyushu, Fukuoka, Japan"],"firstName":"Masaaki","lastName":"Nagahara","id":"37274787900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760475","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose signal detection schemes for massive overloaded multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where the number of receive antennas is less than that of transmitted streams.

Integration of this new technology in handheld devices necessitates efficient compression of HSI data. However, due to the specific mosaic structure of the acquired images, traditional compression methods tailored to full-resolution HSI data cubes fail to exploit the special spatio-spectral interrelations among the pixels. This paper introduces an efficient and computationally tractable compression technique for mosaic HSI images. Specifically, an appropriate decorrelator is constructed for exploiting the spatio-spectral redundancies among the pixels, by modeling the filters arrangement on the mosaic HSI sensor as a multiple-input multiple-output antenna array. Doing so, the decorrelator depends only on the sensor and not on the data to be compressed. Comparison with state-of-the-art compression methods designed for HSI data cubes reveals that our approach achieves better reconstruction quality at lower bits-per-pixel rates.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760510.pdf","startPage":"1558","endPage":"1562","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data compression for snapshot mosaic hyperspectral image sensors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Correlation","Antenna arrays","Hyperspectral imaging","Decorrelation","Sensor arrays","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","decorrelation","hyperspectral imaging","image coding","image reconstruction","image sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["snapshot mosaic hyperspectral image sensor","full-resolution HSI data compression","spectral imaging","handheld device","spatio-spectral interrelation","computationally tractable compression technique","spatio-spectral redundancy","multiple-input multiple-output antenna array","reconstruction quality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral data","snapshot mosaic hyperspectral sensor","image compression","spatio-spectral decorrelation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760510/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Data compression for snapshot mosaic hyperspectral image sensors","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760510/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503216","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data compression for snapshot mosaic hyperspectral image sensors","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570252144.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055279S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760511,"authors":[{"name":"Wael Saafin","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Artificial Intellegence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Saafin","id":"37085684998"},{"name":"Miguel Vega","affiliation":["Dept. of Languages and Information Systems, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Vega","id":"37266909000"},{"name":"Rafael Molina","affiliation":["Dept. of Computer Science and Artificial Intellegence, University of Granada, Granada, Spain"],"firstName":"Rafael","lastName":"Molina","id":"37281601900"},{"name":"Aggelos K.

Although it has been mathematically proven that the separation can be done when the mixture is linear, there is not any proof for the separability of nonlinearly mixed signals. Our contribution in this paper is performing nonlinear BSS for sparse sources. It is shown in this case, sources are separable even if the problem is under-determined (the number of observations is less than the number of source signals). However in the most general case (when the nonlinear mixing model can be of any kind and there is no side-information about that), an unknown nonlinear transformation of each source is reconstructed.

A set of orthogonal waveforms occupying the same band is used to implement the primary MIMO radar operation. The secondary communication function is implemented by embedding one phase-shift keying (PSK) communication symbol in each orthogonal waveform, i.e., the number of embedded communication symbols during each radar pulse equals the number of transmit antennas. We show that the communication operation is transparent to the MIMO radar operation. The communication receiver detects the embedded PSK symbols using standard ratio testing. The achievable data rate is proportional to the pulse repetition frequency, the number of transmit elements, and the size of the PSK constellation. The performance of the proposed technique is investigated in terms of the symbol error rate. Simulations examples demonstrate that data rates in the range of several Mbps can be embedded and reliably detected.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760521","startPage":"1613","endPage":"1617","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760521.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A dual-function MIMO radar-communications system using PSK modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760521/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"A dual-function MIMO radar-communications system using PSK modulation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16539802","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760521/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A dual-function MIMO radar-communications system using PSK modulation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256228.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.14072S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760521","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7760522,"authors":[{"name":"Dani Korpi","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Dani","lastName":"Korpi","id":"37085491520"},{"name":"Taneli Riihonen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, Aalto University School of Electrical Engineering, Finland"],"firstName":"Taneli","lastName":"Riihonen","id":"37392216400"},{"name":"Mikko Valkama","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Valkama","id":"37267657500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760522","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":160},"abstract":"This paper analyzes a self-backhauling inband full-duplex access node that has massive antenna arrays for transmission and reception.

For directional sources, this can be achieved by preserving the relative transfer function (RTF). The recently proposed binaural minimum variance distortionless response (BMVDR) beamformer preserves the RTF of the target, but typically distorts the RTF of the interfering sources. Recently, two extensions of the BMVDR beamformer were proposed preserving the RTFs of both the target and the interferer, namely, the binaural linearly constrained minimum variance (BLCMV) and the BMVDR-RTF beamformers. In this paper, we generalize the BMVDR-RTF to trade off interference reduction and noise reduction. Three special cases of the proposed beamformer are examined, either maximizing the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), or the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR). Experimental validations in an office environment validate our theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760527","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760527.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760527","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","startPage":"1643","endPage":"1647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A generalized binaural MVDR beamformer with interferer relative transfer function preservation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"A generalized binaural MVDR beamformer with interferer relative transfer function preservation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760527/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760527/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503198","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalized binaural MVDR beamformer with interferer relative transfer function preservation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570252245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08898S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760534,"authors":[{"name":"Eva Lagunas","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Eva","lastName":"Lagunas","id":"37972945800"},{"name":"Shree Krishna Sharma","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Shree Krishna","lastName":"Sharma","id":"38489086200"},{"name":"Symeon Chatzinotas","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Symeon","lastName":"Chatzinotas","id":"37265267500"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Ottersten","affiliation":["Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (SnT), University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Ottersten","id":"37266309700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760534","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Probability","Signal to noise ratio","Europe","Compressed sensing","Signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","Gaussian noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","energy detector","sparse signal reconstruction","measurement domain","compressive signal processing","optimal Neyman-Pearson detector","random signals","Gaussian noise","compressive measurements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressive Signal Processing","Compressive Sensing","Energy Detection"]}],"abstract":"While most of research in Compressive Sensing (CS) has been focused on reconstruction of the sparse signal from very fewer samples than the ones required by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem, recently there has been a growing interest in performing signal processing directly in the measurement domain. This new area of research is known in the literature as Compressive Signal Processing (CSP). In this paper, we consider the detection problem using a reduced set of measurements focusing on the Energy Detector (ED), which is the optimal Neyman-Pearson (NP) detector for random signals in Gaussian noise. In particular, we provide simple closed form expressions for evaluating the detection performance of ED when considering compressive measurements. The resulting equations reflect the loss due to CS and allow to determine the minimum number of samples to achieve certain detection performance.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760534","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760534.pdf","startPage":"1678","endPage":"1682","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing based energy detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760534","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760534/","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing based energy detector","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503128","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760534/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing based energy detector","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256092.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060855S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760534","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760535,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaqing Valerie Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Rutgers, State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaqing Valerie","lastName":"Yang","id":"37086192899"},{"name":"Athina P.

In this paper, we investigate the implementation of a deep learning application for vehicle classification on multicore platforms with limited numbers of available processor cores. We apply model-based design methods based on signal processing oriented dataflow models of computation, and using the resulting dataflow representations, we apply various design optimizations to derive efficient implementations on three different multicore platforms. Using model-based design techniques throughout the design process, we demonstrate the ability to flexibly experiment with optimizing design transformations, and alternative multicore target platforms to achieve efficient implementations that are tailored to the resource constraints of these platforms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource-constrained implementation and optimization of a deep neural network for vehicle classification","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760571","startPage":"1862","endPage":"1866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760571.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760571","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Resource-constrained implementation and optimization of a deep neural network for vehicle classification","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760571/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503412","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource-constrained implementation and optimization of a deep neural network for vehicle classification","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082017S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760581,"authors":[{"name":"Gueorgui Pironkov","affiliation":["TCTS Lab, University of Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Gueorgui","lastName":"Pironkov","id":"37085731404"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane Dupont","affiliation":["TCTS Lab, University of Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"St\u00e9phane","lastName":"Dupont","id":"37414234100"},{"name":"Thierry Dutoit","affiliation":["TCTS Lab, University of Mons, Belgium"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Dutoit","id":"37281989900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760581","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":238},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Acoustics","Speech recognition","Hidden Markov models","Machine learning","Speech","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","signal classification","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["speaker-aware long short-term memory multitask learning","speech recognition","speaker classification","over-sensible acoustic model","acoustic model","TIMIT database","recurrent neural network"]}],"abstract":"In order to address the commonly met issue of overfitting in speech recognition, this article investigates Multi-Task Learning, when the auxiliary task focuses on speaker classification. Overfitting occurs when the amount of training data is limited, leading to an over-sensible acoustic model. Multi-Task Learning is a method, among many other regularization methods, which decreases the overfitting impact by forcing the acoustic model to train jointly for multiple different, but related, tasks. In this paper, we consider speaker classification as an auxiliary task in order to improve the generalization abilities of the acoustic model, by training the model to recognize the speaker, or find the closest one inside the training set. We investigate this Multi-Task Learning setup on the TIMIT database, while the acoustic modeling is performed using a Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short-Term Memory cells.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760581","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760581.pdf","startPage":"1911","endPage":"1915","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speaker-aware long short-term memory multi-task learning for speech recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760581/","displayDocTitle":"Speaker-aware long short-term memory multi-task learning for speech recognition","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503269","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760581/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speaker-aware long short-term memory multi-task learning for speech recognition","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570252203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.107319S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760585,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Ulrich","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Ulrich","id":"37699980100"},{"name":"Kilian Rambach","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Kilian","lastName":"Rambach","id":"37077871400"},{"name":"Bin Yang","affiliation":["Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37399884400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760585","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":315},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Radar","Couplings","Radar antennas","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","MIMO radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival estimation","Cramer-Rao bound","multicarrier MIMO radar","multiple-input multiple-output radar","sparse virtual arrays","range-DOA coupling","MC-MIMO systems","grating lobes","CRB","DOA parameters","sequential range"]}],"abstract":"Multi-carrier (MC) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar was recently applied to build sparse virtual arrays with a large aperture for a high-accuracy direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The resulting grating lobes (DOA ambiguities) were resolved using multiple carriers. One problem of MC-MIMO is the coupling of the unknown parameters range and DOA. In this contribution, we study this range-DOA coupling for MC-MIMO systems. We consider both Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of these parameters and their estimation. We show that a suitable choice of the coordinate system decouples range and DOA parameters in both CRB and estimation. This enables a sequential range and DOA estimation instead of a more complex joint estimation. Explanations of this phenomenon are given and simulation results confirm the theoretical findings.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760585","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760585.pdf","startPage":"1931","endPage":"1935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation and Cramer-Rao bound for multi-carrier MIMO radar","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760585/","displayDocTitle":"Direction-of-arrival estimation and Cramer-Rao bound for multi-carrier MIMO radar","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503072","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760585/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direction-of-arrival estimation and Cramer-Rao bound for multi-carrier MIMO radar","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119721S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760589,"authors":[{"name":"Eunwoo Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Eunwoo","lastName":"Song","id":"37085510750"},{"name":"Hong-Goo Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Hong-Goo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37278425200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760589","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":233},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-class learning algorithm for deep neural network-based statistical parametric speech synthesis","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760589.pdf","startPage":"1951","endPage":"1955","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760589","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Training","Hidden Markov models","Speech","Acoustics","Context","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiclass learning algorithm","deep neural network-based statistical parametric speech synthesis","MCL algorithm","DNN-based SPSS system","statistical parameters","training process","training data global characteristics","DNN-based context clustering algorithm","shared hidden layer-based MCL algorithm","class-dependent characteristics","universal characteristics","phonetic information","model over-fitting problem","over-smoothing effect"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Statistical parametric speech synthesis","deep neural network","context clustering","shared hidden layer"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760589","abstract":"This paper proposes a multi-class learning (MCL) algorithm for a deep neural network (DNN)-based statistical parametric speech synthesis (SPSS) system.

We introduce a DNN-based context clustering algorithm that implicitly divides the training data into several classes, and train them via a shared hidden layer-based MCL algorithm.

Is there a substantial improvement in the capacity of 3D MIMO system in comparison to the classical 2D case? To answer these questions, extensive field measurements were conducted for the outdoor to indoor scenarios in China and New Zealand. Key channel parameters are extracted from the measured channel impulse response via the space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization algorithm, followed by the reconstruction of the 32 \u00d7 56 CIR according to 2D and 3D channel model. Then CIRs are used to evaluate the channel capacity and comparative simulation results demonstrate that the 3D MIMO capacity closely approximates the capacity predicted with practical CIRs. Moreover, obvious enhancements in the capacity of 3D channel is observed in comparison to 2D case. In addition, the distribution of eigenvalues and the number of contributing eigenvalues are also investigated.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Three-dimensional displays","Antenna

original designed for Time Division Duplex (TDD) also in Frequency-Division Duplexing (FDD). For efficient multi-user downlink transmission Channel State Information (CSI) has to be obtained at the receiver side and fed back to the transmitter. Due to signaling/pilot overhead scaling with the number of antennas and the feedback of the CSI the beamforming gain and spatial multiplexing gains of massive MIMO are limited. In this paper we present a novel scheme called User Non-aware Precoding and Effective Channel Estimation (UNP & ECE) for full dimension MIMO in FDD under signaling and feedback constraints. The idea is to construct a large codebook and distribute subsets of it on time-frequency resources as precoded pilots. The same precoders are also used for downlink transmission thus no additional demodulation reference signals are required. This limits the number of signaling overhead and a high quantization of the channel can be utilized. To limit the feedback we show that it is sufficient to report only the strongest stream index of a precoder subset for only a subset of Time Frequency (TF) resources. By sending just the index of the best stream the devices don't require knowledge of the applied precoders. This enables optimization of the codebook construction, the splitting in subsets, the distribution on the TF resources at the base station without awareness at the users.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760596","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760596.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","startPage":"1985","endPage":"1989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Full dimension MIMO for frequency division duplex under signaling and feedback constraints","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760596","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Full dimension MIMO for frequency division duplex under signaling and feedback constraints","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760596/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517743","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760596/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full dimension MIMO for frequency division duplex under signaling and feedback constraints","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570255095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082778S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760597,"authors":[{"name":"Giuseppe Destino","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Giuseppe","lastName":"Destino","id":"37298698900"},{"name":"Jani Saloranta","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Jani","lastName":"Saloranta","id":"37298232100"},{"name":"Markku Juntti","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Markku","lastName":"Juntti","id":"37269762200"},{"name":"Shirish Nagaraj","affiliation":["Next Generation and Standards, Commun.

In this paper we evaluate the channel energy and the average throughput of typical indoor- and outdoor UEs at various heights and distances to the macro site. Our goal is to demonstrate the achievable spatial resolution of the beamforming in vertical direction with large antenna arrays. Existing work on directional beamforming strategies is commonly based on simplistic signal propagation assumptions under LOS conditions. This paper considers a realistic 3D channel model that also accounts for multi-path propagation under NLOS conditions. Our results exhibit the dependency of the achievable spatial resolution on both, the size of the antenna array as well as the channel conditions. They show that depending on whether the UE is located indoors or outdoors, the channel has an opposing impact on the achievable spatial resolution.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760598.pdf","startPage":"1995","endPage":"1999","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating the spatial resolution of 2D antenna arrays for massive MIMO transmissions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Antenna measurements","Linear antenna arrays","Spatial resolution","Two dimensional displays","3GPP"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","cellular radio","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath propagation","directional beamforming strategies","average throughput","channel energy","user equipments","mobile cellular networks","5th generation","massive MIMO transmissions","large 2D antenna arrays","spatial resolution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D beamforming","spatial resolution","3GPP 3D channel model","antenna array","elevation","azimuth","massive MIMO","vertical sectorization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760598/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the spatial resolution of 2D antenna arrays for massive MIMO transmissions","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760598/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517742","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the spatial resolution of 2D antenna arrays for massive MIMO transmissions","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256341.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06266S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760598","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760599,"authors":[{"name":"Antti Arvola","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Arvola","id":"37086072739"},{"name":"Antti T\u00f6lli","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"T\u00f6lli","id":"37284723300"},{"name":"David Gesbert","affiliation":["EURECOM, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Gesbert","id":"37274459900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760599","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Interference","Covariance matrices","Array signal processing","Precoding","Antennas","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","antenna arrays","array signal processing","covariance matrices","interference suppression","MIMO communication","optimisation","precoding","radiofrequency interference","statistical analysis","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dimensionality reduction","massive MIMO network","multiple input multiple output system","5G system","interference reduction capability","antenna","high-dimensional matrix operation","two-stage digital beamforming","channel variation","two-stage precoding optimization problem","weighted sum-rate maximization","minimum user rate maximization","single-cell downlink system","heuristic method","user channel covariance","optimization problem","energy maximization","user group location","statistical prebeam","complexity reduction effect"]}],"abstract":"Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a promising technology for the upcoming 5G as it provides significant beamforming gains and interference reduction capabilities due to the large number of antennas. However, massive MIMO is computationally demanding, as the high antenna count results in high-dimensional matrix operations when conventional MIMO processing is applied. In this paper, we focus on two-stage digital beamforming, where the beamformer is split into a slow-varying statistics-based outer beamformer and an inner beamformer accounting for fast channel variations. We formulate two two-stage precoding optimization problems: weighted sum-rate maximization and minimum user rate maximization for a single-cell downlink system. We also provide different heuristic methods of forming the outer precoder matrix via user channel covariance, while the inner precoder is obtained as a result for the optimization problem. Unlike most previous work, which consider the outer precoder design based on energy maximization and user group location, our aim is to design it to offer a tradeoff between energy maximization and interference reduction, and also take into account the fairness between users. We evaluate the performance of the different heuristic methods as a function of the number of statistical pre-beams and a fixed user angular spread to see the overall effect of complexity reduction on the system sum-rate and minimum user rate. We also evaluate the advantages of different methods in terms of user fairness.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760599","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760599.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","startPage":"2000","endPage":"2004","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-layer precoding for dimensionality reduction in massive MIMO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Two-layer precoding for dimensionality reduction in massive MIMO","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760599/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503270","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760599/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-layer precoding for dimensionality reduction in massive MIMO","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256528.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.091757S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760601,"authors":[{"name":"Sofia Savvaki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Crete","Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Greece"],"firstName":"Sofia","lastName":"Savvaki","id":"37086208275"},{"name":"Grigorios Tsagkatakis","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Greece"],"firstName":"Grigorios","lastName":"Tsagkatakis","id":"37397659900"},{"name":"Athanasia Panousopoulou","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Greece"],"firstName":"Athanasia","lastName":"Panousopoulou","id":"37301168600"},{"name":"Panagiotis Tsakalides","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Crete","Institute of Computer Science, Foundation for Research and Technology Hellas (FORTH), Heraklion, Greece"],"firstName":"Panagiotis","lastName":"Tsakalides","id":"37298333300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760601","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":67},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760601","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Feature extraction","Europe","Signal processing","Predictive models","Size measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","estimation theory","matrix algebra","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix completion","MC","human activity recognition","HAR dataset classification","linear acceleration estimation","angular velocity measurement estimation"]}],"abstract":"Classification of activities of daily living is of paramount importance in modern healthcare applications.

The results highlight that robust and efficient classification is feasible even with a substantially reduced amount of measurements.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760601","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760601.pdf","startPage":"2010","endPage":"2014","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of matrix completion on the classification of undersampled human activity data streams","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Effects of matrix completion on the classification of undersampled human activity data streams","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760601/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503105","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760601/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of matrix completion on the classification of undersampled human activity data streams","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256091.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054544S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760601","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760612,"authors":[{"name":"Shuangling Wang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Information Systems Engineering Key Laboratory, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Shuangling","lastName":"Wang","id":"37858719700"},{"name":"Songhua Huang","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Information Systems Engineering Key Laboratory, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Songhua","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086202068"},{"name":"Zishu He","affiliation":["EE Department, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"firstName":"Zishu","lastName":"He","id":"37278355000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760612","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"abstract":"In this paper, the waveform design for transmit beampattern synthesis is studied in MIMO radar systems with colocated antennas. The waveform transmitted at each antenna is defined as a weighted sum of a set of discrete prolate spheroidal (DPS) sequences which have good orthogonal and band-limited properties. Assume that different transmit antennas use the same set of DPS sequences, while the weighting factors are variable which allows the correlation between different waveforms to be flexible and varied with the weighting factors. Optimum waveforms are designed to achieve a desired transmit beampattern under the constraint of a fixed total transmit energy. Unlike a traditional process, in which the waveform covariance matrix is designed in the first step and then the optimal waveforms are synthesised in the second step based on the designed waveform covariance matrix, it is shown in this work that the waveforms constructed by the DPS sequences need only one step to design the optimum waveforms. In this paper, we propose a new waveform design method for transmit beampattern synthesis which can efficiently match a desired transmit beampattern and control the power distributed at each beam in beampattern simultaneously. The choice of the number of the DPS sequences is also analyzed. Numerical simulations are provided to compare the performance of proposed method with that of the traditional methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760612.pdf","startPage":"2065","endPage":"2069","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760612","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760612","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760612","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO radar waveform design for transmit beampattern synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar antennas","MIMO radar","Optimization","Covariance matrices","Transmitting antennas","Design methodology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","covariance matrices","MIMO radar","radar antennas","radar signal processing","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO radar waveform design","transmit beampattern synthesis","colocated antennas","discrete prolate spheroidal sequence","DPS sequence","orthogonal properties","band-limited properties","transmit antennas","fixed total transmit energy constraint","waveform covariance matrix","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar","waveform design","DPS sequences","transmit beampattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760612/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"MIMO radar waveform design for transmit beampattern synthesis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760612/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16503185","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO radar waveform design for transmit beampattern synthesis","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570250796.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070337S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760612","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760614,"authors":[{"name":"Baris Erol","affiliation":["Center for Advanced Communications, Villanova University, Villanova, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Baris","lastName":"Erol","id":"37085783789"},{"name":"Moeness G.

It reduces false alarms along with the associated cost in the unnecessary deployment of the first responders.

The resulting mean squared error expression depends on the observation period, the pulse period and the pulse duration. Analyzing the effect of these parameters shows that the mean squared error can be reduced (i) if the observation period is a multiple of the pulse period, (ii) if the pulse period is not a multiple of the sampling period, and (iii) if the total number of samples is a prime number.

In this paper, we propose a pedestrian detection approach that uses convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate pedestrian and non-pedestrian motion patterns. Although the CNN has good generalization performance, the CNN classifier is time-consuming. Therefore, we propose a novel architecture to reduce the time of feature extraction and training. Occlusion handling is one of the most important problem in pedestrian detection. For occlusion handling, we propose a method, which consists of extensive part detectors. The main advantage of our algorithm is that it can be trained on weakly labeled data, i.e. it does not require part annotations in the pedestrian bounding boxes.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760631","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760631.pdf","startPage":"2161","endPage":"2165","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting pedestrians in surveillance videos based on convolutional neural network and motion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760631/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Detecting pedestrians in surveillance videos based on convolutional neural network and motion","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16503137","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760631/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting pedestrians in surveillance videos based on convolutional neural network and motion","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256220.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113572S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760639,"authors":[{"name":"Dominik Reinhard","affiliation":["Signal Processing Group, Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt, Darmstadt"],"firstName":"Dominik","lastName":"Reinhard","id":"37086201132"},{"name":"Michael Fau\u00df","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Darmstadt Fachbereich Biologie, Darmstadt, Hessen, DE"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Fau\u00df","id":"37086862049"},{"name":"Abdelhak M.

In this paper, a sequential and robust solution approach is presented. To design the test fulfilling constraints on the error probabilities and the quality of the estimate, the problem is converted into an unconstrained form and subsequently solved using Linear Programming. To handle model uncertainties, a band model for both hypotheses is used and a concept for determining the pair of least favorable distributions is adopted to devise a robust detection scheme. For the robust estimation, an upper bound of the estimation cost, based on maximizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence, is derived. The resulting test meets the specifications on the error probabilities and the quality of the estimate for every feasible pair of distributions. Numerical results are provided for the pair of least favorable distributions and for a pair of randomly selected distributions.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760639","startPage":"2201","endPage":"2205","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760639.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approach to joint sequential detection and estimation with distributional uncertainties","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Robustness","Error probability","Signal processing","Uncertainty","Upper bound","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","linear programming","sequential estimation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint sequential detection","joint sequential estimation","distributional uncertainties","signal processing","error probabilities","linear programming","Kullback-Leibler divergence","robust solution approach","least favorable distributions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["band model","distributional uncertainties","joint detection and estimation","linear programming","optimization","robustness","sequential analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760639/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"An approach to joint sequential detection and estimation with distributional uncertainties","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760639/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16539818","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approach to joint sequential detection and estimation with distributional uncertainties","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051422S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760639","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7760642,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Mahdi Naghsh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mahdi","lastName":"Naghsh","id":"37546088800"},{"name":"Ehsan Haj Mirza Alian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Ehsan Haj Mirza","lastName":"Alian","id":"38246670400"},{"name":"Mahmood Modarres Hashemi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran"],"firstName":"Mahmood Modarres","lastName":"Hashemi","id":"37288493000"},{"name":"Mohammad Mahdi Nayebi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Mahdi","lastName":"Nayebi","id":"37273045900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760642","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Clutter","Peak to average power ratio","Measurement","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","cognitive radio","encoding","MIMO radar","radar antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive MIMO radar","information theoretic code design approach","cognitive multiple-input multiple-output radar","agile multiantenna radar","spectral cognition"]}],"abstract":"A novel information theoretic code design approach for cognitive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radars is proposed in the current paper.

Recent studies on supervised speech segregation show good promise to alleviate this problem by separating speech-dominated from noise-dominated spectro-temporal regions with estimated time-frequency masks. The current study compared a previously proposed feature set to a novel auditory-model based feature set using a common deep neural network based speech enhancement framework. The performance of both feature extraction methods was evaluated with objective measurements and a subjective listening test to measure speech perception scores in terms of intelligibility and quality with 17 hearing-impaired listeners. Significant improvements in speech intelligibility and quality ratings were found for both feature extraction systems. However, the auditory-model based feature set showed superior performance compared to the comparison feature set indicating that auditory-model based processing could provide further improvements for supervised speech segregation systems and their potential applications in hearing instruments.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760659","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760659.pdf","startPage":"2300","endPage":"2304","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760659","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speech enhancement for hearing-impaired listeners using deep neural networks with auditory-model based features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760659/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","displayDocTitle":"Speech enhancement for hearing-impaired listeners using deep neural networks with auditory-model based features","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16503239","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760659/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech enhancement for hearing-impaired listeners using deep neural networks with auditory-model based features","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570252244.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045929S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760659","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-19"},{"_id":7760661,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandr Diment","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Aleksandr","lastName":"Diment","id":"37085738715"},{"name":"Mikko Parviainen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikko","lastName":"Parviainen","id":"37424653200"},{"name":"Tuomas Virtanen","affiliation":["Department of Signal Processing, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"firstName":"Tuomas","lastName":"Virtanen","id":"37285488100"},{"name":"Roman Zelov","affiliation":["Behavox, London"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Zelov","id":"38490689200"},{"name":"Alex Glasman","affiliation":["Behavox, London"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Glasman","id":"37542031200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760661","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760661","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech","Feature extraction","Noise measurement","Training","Signal processing","Neural networks","Speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","distortion","neural nets","telecommunication computing","telephone sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["phone line distortions","group delay feature","APGD","all-pole models","DNN-based whispering detection system","background noise","whispered speech detection","deep neural networks","telephone calls","noise-robust detection"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760661","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760661.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","startPage":"2310","endPage":"2314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise-robust detection of whispering in telephone calls using deep neural networks","abstract":"Detection of whispered speech in the presence of high levels of background noise has applications in fraudulent behaviour recognition.

Moreover, assessing the quality of speech without any reference or the ground truth is altogether more difficult. In this paper, we propose a new non-intrusive speech quality assessment metric for objective evaluation of speech quality. The originality of proposed scheme lies in using deep autoencoder to extract low-dimensional features from a spectrum of the speech signal and finds a mapping between features and subjective scores using an artificial neural network (ANN). We have shown that autoencoder features capture noise information in a better way than state-of-the-art Filterbank Energies (FBEs).

Though a lot of successful work was invested in expressiveness analysis and prediction, the results often involve manual labeling, or indirect prediction evaluation such as speech synthesis. The proposed analysis aims at direct acoustic feature prediction and comparison to original acoustic features from an audiobook. The audiobook is mapped in a semantic vector space. A set of acoustic features is extracted from the same utterances, involving iVectors trained on MFCC and F0 basis. Two regression models are trained with the semantic coordinates, DNNs and a baseline CART. Later, semantic and acoustic context features are combined for the prediction. The prediction is achieved successfully using the DNNs. A closer analysis shows that the prediction works best for larger utterances or utterances with specific contexts, and worst for general short utterances and proper names.","doi":"10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760663","publicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 24th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7740646/7760191/07760663.pdf","startPage":"2320","endPage":"2324","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EUSIPCO.2016.7760663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760191","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760663","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acoustic feature prediction from semantic features for expressive speech using deep neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760663/","displayDocTitle":"Acoustic feature prediction from semantic features for expressive speech using deep neural networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760663/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517739","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acoustic feature prediction from semantic features for expressive speech using deep neural networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570256345.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072206S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760664,"authors":[{"name":"Santiago Pascual","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Santiago","lastName":"Pascual","id":"37086204231"},{"name":"Antonio Bonafonte","affiliation":["Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Bonafonte","id":"37427200000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9928-6265-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1891-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2076-1465"}],"articleNumber":"7760664","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":431},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Adaptation models","Acoustics","Computer architecture","Speech","Speech synthesis","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","recurrent neural nets","speaker recognition","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple speaker speech synthesis","multiple speaker speech adaptation","multioutput RNN-LSTM","deep learning","base optimized model","fine tuning method","long short term memory architecture","recurrent neural network"]}],"abstract":"Deep Learning has been applied successfully to speech processing.

this paper, we propose a novel single-group multicast beamforming technique using non-orthogonal space-time block coding (STBC). In the system, a multi-antenna base station broadcasts its information to a large group of single-antenna users. We introduce a modified max-min fair beamforming optimization problem, which maximizes the worst user's modified Euclidean distance instead of the conventional worst user's signal-to-noise ratio. Our beamforming formulation extends the traditional max-min fair problem, by taking the pairwise error probability of the employed STBC into consideration, which in turns improves the overall system performance. For the resulting non-convex quadratically constrained quadratic program, an iterative inner convex approximation method is devised, in which the non-convex part of the problem is linearized and a sequence of inner convex optimization problems is solved. Simulation results demonstrate considerable improvement for networks with a large number of users.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760672/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16503287","htmlLink":"/document/7760672/","conferenceDate":"29 Aug.-2 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Full-rate general rank beamforming in single-group multicasting networks using non-orthogonal STBC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Full-rate general rank beamforming in single-group multicasting networks using non-orthogonal STBC","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"1570255715.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069227S","chronDate":"Aug. 29 2016-Sept. 2 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7740646","isNumber":"7760191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7740646","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7760191","articleId":"7760672","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"EURASIP","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7760674,"authors":[{"name":"Alexander A.

As a result, a shrinkage is given to enhance the performance of the LMMN algorithm when the majority of the channel taps are zeros or near-zeros.

Whereas its previous applications were mostly limited to research and simple designs, it is now being used to tape-out real-world chips in production [1]. Advances in compiler and HLS research continue to improve the quality of HLS-generated hardware. Despite this, the ease-of-use of HLS tools remains a hurdle to its broad uptake, particularly by engineers without hardware skills. To this end, we propose using a well-known software technique to infer streaming parallel hardware in HLS. Specifically, we use the producer-consumer pattern, commonly used in multi-threaded programming, to infer the generation of hardware that can exploit both pipeline and spatial parallelism on FPGAs. Our proposed methodology allows one to create a design in software, using only standard software methodologies, that cannot only synthesize to streaming hardware, but also model the generated hardware more accurately than existing solutions from other state-of-the-art C-based HLS tools. We use four different real-world benchmarks to illustrate the use of our methodology, and how it can create circuits that are either pipelined, or pipelined and replicated, all from software. For comparison, we also use a commercial HLS tool to synthesize one of the benchmarks, and show that our methodology can produce competitive results to that of the commercial tool.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760775/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16505889","htmlLink":"/document/7760775/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A unified software approach to specify pipeline and spatial parallelism in FPGA hardware","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A unified software approach to specify pipeline and spatial parallelism in FPGA hardware","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"009_paper_29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103309S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750935","isNumber":"7760761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750935","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7760761","articleId":"7760775","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760779,"authors":[{"name":"Wenlai Zhao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, and Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Wenlai Zhao","id":"37087138310"},{"name":"Haohuan Fu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, and Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Haohuan Fu","id":"37087138316"},{"name":"Wayne Luk","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial college, London, UK"],"firstName":"Wayne","lastName":"Luk","id":"37272281200"},{"name":"Teng Yu","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial college, London, UK"],"lastName":"Teng Yu","id":"37086801274"},{"name":"Shaojun Wang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Test and Control, Harbin Institute of Technology, China"],"lastName":"Shaojun Wang","id":"37087138291"},{"name":"Bo Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China"],"lastName":"Bo Feng","id":"37087138317"},{"name":"Yuchun Ma","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China"],"lastName":"Yuchun Ma","id":"37087138294"},{"name":"Guangwen Yang","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, and Center for Earth System Science, Tsinghua University, China","Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, China"],"lastName":"Guangwen Yang","id":"37087138315"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1503-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1504-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-052X"}],"articleNumber":"7760779","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3448},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"F-CNN: An FPGA-based framework for training Convolutional Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750935/7760761/07760779.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"114","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2016.7760779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760761","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2016.7760779","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Field programmable gate arrays","Convolution","Computational modeling","Bandwidth","Neural networks","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["32-bit floating-point arithmetic","hardware resources","bandwidth resources","streaming datapath","convolutional neural networks","FPGA-based framework"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760779","abstract":"This paper presents a novel reconfigurable framework for training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed framework is based on reconfiguring a streaming datapath at runtime to cover the training cycle for the various layers in a CNN. The streaming datapath can support various parameterized modules which can be customized to produce implementations with different trade-offs in performance and resource usage. The modules follow the same input and output data layout, simplifying configuration scheduling. For different layers, instances of the modules contain different computation kernels in parallel, which can be customized with different layer configurations and data precision. The associated models on performance, resource and bandwidth can be used in deriving parameters for the datapath to guide the analysis of design trade-offs to meet application requirements or platform constraints. They enable estimation of the implementation specifications given different layer configurations, to maximize performance under the constraints on bandwidth and hardware resources. Experimental results indicate that the proposed module design targeting Maxeler technology can achieve a performance of 62.06 GFLOPS for 32-bit floating-point arithmetic, outperforming existing accelerators. Further evaluation based on training LeNet-5 shows that the proposed framework achieves about 4 times faster than CPU implementation of Caffe and about 7.5 times more energy efficient than the GPU implementation of Caffe.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760779/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16505895","htmlLink":"/document/7760779/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"F-CNN: An FPGA-based framework for training Convolutional Neural Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"F-CNN: An FPGA-based framework for training Convolutional Neural Networks","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"013_paper_51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075806S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750935","isNumber":"7760761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750935","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7760761","articleId":"7760779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":7760788,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Christian K\u00e4ssens","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kiel University, Germany"],"firstName":"Jan Christian","lastName":"K\u00e4ssens","id":"37085558168"},{"name":"Lars Wienbrandt","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kiel University, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Wienbrandt","id":"38476706400"},{"name":"Manfred Schimmler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Kiel University, Germany"],"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Schimmler","id":"37326447900"},{"name":"Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez-Dom\u00ednguez","affiliation":["Computer Architecture Group, University of A Coru\u00f1a, Spain"],"firstName":"Jorge","lastName":"Gonz\u00e1lez-Dom\u00ednguez","id":"38273210700"},{"name":"Bertil Schmidt","affiliation":["Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz Institute of Computer Science, Germany"],"firstName":"Bertil","lastName":"Schmidt","id":"37085562216"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1503-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1504-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-052X"}],"articleNumber":"7760788","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Graphics processing units","Genetics","Computer architecture","Bioinformatics","Computational modeling","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","genomics","graphics processing units","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pairwise interaction analysis","genome-wide association studies","quantitative genetics","GWAS","efficient exhaustive interaction analysis","FPGA","GPU"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760788","abstract":"Interaction between genes has become a major topic in quantitative genetics.

DPD systems are important components for power amplifier linearization in wireless communication transceivers. In contrast to conventional DPD implementation methods, which are focused on optimizing a single objective - most commonly, the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) - without systematically taking into account other relevant metrics, we consider DPD system implementation in a multiobjective optimization context. In our targeted multiobjective context, trade-offs among power consumption and multiple DPD performance metrics are jointly optimized subject to performance constraints imposed by the given modulation scheme. Through synthesis and simulation results, we demonstrate that DPD systems derived through our design space exploration techniques exhibit significantly improved trade-offs among multidimensional implementation criteria, including energy consumption, ACPR, and symbol error-rate. Additionally, we perform experiments using three different LTE modulation schemes, and we demonstrate that our multiobjective optimization approach significantly enhances system adaptivity in response to changes in the employed modulation scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design space exploration and constrained multiobjective optimization for digital predistortion systems","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2016.7760790","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750935/7760761/07760790.pdf","startPage":"182","endPage":"185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2016.7760790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760761","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760790","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Design space exploration and constrained multiobjective optimization for digital predistortion systems","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760790/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16505892","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design space exploration and constrained multiobjective optimization for digital predistortion systems","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"024_paper_31.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06177S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750935","isNumber":"7760761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750935","xplore-issue":"7760761","articleId":"7760790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760791,"authors":[{"name":"Antonyus P.

complexity, making real time encoding of high resolution videos a challenging task. This challenge can be addressed by software, yet hardware solutions are more appealing due to their superior performance and low power consumption. This paper presents an FPGA based hardware implementation of an all intra HEVC encoder, which can encode 8 bits per sample, 1920\u00d71080 resolution, 30 frames per second raw video, that is viable in real time even at low operating frequencies. A major obstacle to real time encoding in available architectures is the dependency created by reference generation. Moreover, each coding unit (CU) has to be processed in multiple configurations to determine the most efficient split and prediction mode representation, based on the bit stream generated. We propose a new three stage architecture to reduce these dependencies and increase parallelism. Feedback needed for CU split and prediction direction decision from binarization is avoided by a Hadamard based early decision method. Feedback constrained coefficient and reconstruction derivation module exploits several optimization techniques. All modules can operate at 200 MHz and the encoder can achieve real time encoding with a minimum operating frequency of 140 MHz. The design consumes 83K LUTs, 28K registers, and 34 DSPs when implemented on Xilinx Zynq ZC706.","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2016.7760792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2016.7760792","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750935/7760761/07760792.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"195","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760792/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Real time all intra HEVC HD encoder on FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16505888","htmlLink":"/document/7760792/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real time all intra HEVC HD encoder on FPGA","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"026_paper_90.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085439S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750935","isNumber":"7760761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750935","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7760761","articleId":"7760792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760794,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto R.

The model consists of a set of nonlinear differential equations that can be solved using numerical methods for a given choice of parameters.

In this work, we present a pipelined architecture for performing the 4th order Runge-Kutta integration of the equations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, introducing convenient implementations of complex mathematical functions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined FPGA implementation of numerical integration of the Hodgkin-Huxley model","doi":"10.1109/ASAP.2016.7760794","startPage":"202","endPage":"206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASAP.2016.7760794","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760761","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 27th International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architectures and Processors (ASAP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750935/7760761/07760794.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760794","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 July 2016","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined FPGA implementation of numerical integration of the Hodgkin-Huxley model","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760794/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16505880","conferenceDate":"6-8 July 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined FPGA implementation of numerical integration of the Hodgkin-Huxley model","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"028_paper_13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049593S","chronDate":"6-8 July 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750935","isNumber":"7760761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750935","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760761","articleId":"7760794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760804,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed S.

The self-backhauling of relays towards a serving (donor) eNode B provides cost-effective solution for deployment scenarios where conventional backhauling is either costly or unavailable. The end-to-end throughputs achievable by users served by relays are dependent on achievable throughputs on both the relay access and backhaul links. The 3GPP standardized Type 1 inband relay node (RN) employs a time-based resource partitioning between relay backhaul and access links. This resource allocation strategy coupled with sharing of eNode B (eNB) resources between the RN and users served directly by the eNB usually creates a backhaul bottleneck. The relay backhaul link performance is further degraded due to intercell interference, particularly on the cell edge where the deployment of relays are usually targeted. In this paper, the relay user's throughput enhancements by relaxation of relay backhaul bottlenecks are investigated through the use of beamforming and interference mitigation techniques. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in relay backhaul performance and end-to-end throughputs for relay users through the use of limited feedback beamforming and interference mitigation schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760843/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16506278","publicationDate":"June 2016","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760843/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Use of beamforming and interference mitigation techniques for relay backhaul enhancement","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Use of beamforming and interference mitigation techniques for relay backhaul enhancement","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"04_003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073181S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750937","isNumber":"7760810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750937","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760810","articleId":"7760843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7760846,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaleh Sadreddini","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Zhaleh","lastName":"Sadreddini","id":"37085691963"},{"name":"Tu\u011frul \u00c7avdar","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tu\u011frul","lastName":"\u00c7avdar","id":"38466255400"},{"name":"Erkan G\u00fcler","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Giresun University, Giresun, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erkan","lastName":"G\u00fcler","id":"37085691448"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1288-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1289-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7760846","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760846","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Cognitive radio","Heuristic algorithms","Radio spectrum management","Simulation","Quality of service","Spectral analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance analysis","dynamic switch system","cognitive radio network","secondary users","primary users","spectrum management techniques","instant overbooking framework for cognitive radio networks","IOFCR","policy complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum management","spectrum utilization","spectrum assignment algorithms","dynamic switch","overbooking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.7760846","publicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750937/7760810/07760846.pdf","startPage":"145","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.7760846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of the dynamic switch system based on user activity in cognitive radio network","abstract":"According to the peak hours of the day, the number of sensed primary users (PUs) and also requesting secondary users (RSUs) will be dramatically increased.

Instant Overbooking Framework for Cognitive Radio Networks (IOFCR) is used to maximize both spectrum utilization and the network revenue under several spectrum management policies. In this paper, dynamic switch system based on user activity is designed for IOFCR.

Results show that the computational complexity can be significantly decreased with a limited performance loss cost.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750937/7760810/07760847.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"152","publicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.7760847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.7760847","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760810","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced-complexity decoding algorithms of Raptor codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Approximation algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Computational complexity","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","AWGN channels","channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","error statistics","Monte Carlo methods","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MC-DE method","Monte Carlo based density evolution method","AWGN channel","additive white Gaussian noise channel","BER","bit error rate","computational complexity reduction","Raptor decoder structure","LDPC code","low density parity check code","BP based approximation method","belief propagation based approximation method","Raptor code reduced-complexity decoding algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Belief propagation","BP-based approximations","Rateless codes","Raptor codes","Reduced-complexity decoding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760847/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Reduced-complexity decoding algorithms of Raptor codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760847/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16518041","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced-complexity decoding algorithms of Raptor codes","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"04_164.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095046S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750937","isNumber":"7760810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750937","xplore-issue":"7760810","articleId":"7760847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760848,"authors":[{"name":"Yigit Mahmutoglu","affiliation":["Energy Systems Engineering, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, Rize, Turkey"],"firstName":"Yigit","lastName":"Mahmutoglu","id":"37086013924"},{"name":"Kadir Turk","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Kadir","lastName":"Turk","id":"37946726800"},{"name":"Emin Tugcu","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Engineering, Karadeniz Technical University, Trabzon, Turkey"],"firstName":"Emin","lastName":"Tugcu","id":"38467418600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1288-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1289-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7760848","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":265},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760848","abstract":"In this paper, we proposed particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm based adaptive decision feedback equalizer (DFE) for underwater acoustic communication (UWAC). In the literature, although ocean ambient noise is generally modeled as pink Gaussian noise, there is also site-specific ocean noise which can be modeled as pink Laplace noise. In this study we consider both noises. Rayleigh distributed, frequency selective fading channels (as UWAC channel) with Laplacian and Gaussian distributed, pink noise are considered. Unlike recursive least squares (RLS) and least mean squares (LMS) algorithms, PSO is independent from channel characteristics and has faster convergence. To the best of our knowledge PSO algorithm has not been used for adaptive DFE over UWAC channel. The communication performances and computational complexities of LMS, RLS and PSO based adaptive DFEs are compared. Although PSO has the highest computational complexity, our simulation results show PSO-DFE outperforms the other algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.7760848","startPage":"153","endPage":"156","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750937/7760810/07760848.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.7760848","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Particle swarm optimization algorithm based decision feedback equalizer for underwater acoustic communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["1f noise","Decision feedback equalizers","Laplace equations","Underwater acoustics","Fading channels","Computational complexity","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive equalisers","computational complexity","decision feedback equalisers","Gaussian distribution","Gaussian noise","particle swarm optimisation","Rayleigh channels","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","Laplacian distribution","Gaussian distribution","Rayleigh distribution","frequency selective fading channel","pink Laplace noise","site-specific ocean noise","pink Gaussian noise","UWAC channel","adaptive DFE","adaptive decision feedback equalizer","underwater acoustic communication","PSO algorithm","particle swarm optimization algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["acoustic communication","decision feedback equalizer","Laplacian pink noise","particle swarm optimization","underwater"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760848/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"Particle swarm optimization algorithm based decision feedback equalizer for underwater acoustic communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760848/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2016","accessionNumber":"16518055","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Particle swarm optimization algorithm based decision feedback equalizer for underwater acoustic communication","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"04_171.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055019S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750937","isNumber":"7760810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750937","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760810","articleId":"7760848","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7760857,"authors":[{"name":"Antonina Melikhova","affiliation":["Radio Engineering and Telecommunication Systems, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Antonina","lastName":"Melikhova","id":"37086200047"},{"name":"Igor Tsikin","affiliation":["Radio Engineering and Telecommunication Systems, Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University, St. Petersburg, Russia"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Tsikin","id":"37086201449"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1288-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1289-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7760857","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"abstract":"In this paper planar antenna arrays with a small number of elements are discussed as applied to angle-of-arrival (AOA) integrity monitoring method for global-navigation satellite systems (GNSS).

These systems are promising for the improvement of the quality of life of elderly and disabled people. One important characteristic of health and well-being is sleep. While sleep quantity is directly measurable, its quality has traditionally been assessed with subjective methods such as questionnaires. In this paper, we propose a non-intrusive sleep analyzer for real time detection of sleep anomalies, part of an effective AAL system. The proposed solution is based on combination of non-invasive sensors and an algorithm for sleep analysis with two stages - low and high level reasoning. It also offers the opportunity to include third party devices. Using the analyzer we can monitor basic sleep behavior and to detect sleep anomalies, which can serve as an important indicator for both mental and physical health.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.7760906","publicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750937/7760810/07760906.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.7760906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760810","startPage":"400","endPage":"404","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-intrusive sleep analyzer for real time detection of sleep anomalies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Non-intrusive sleep analyzer for real time detection of sleep anomalies","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760906/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16506224","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7760906/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-intrusive sleep analyzer for real time detection of sleep anomalies","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"08_218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044701S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750937","isNumber":"7760810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750937","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7760810","articleId":"7760906","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760912,"authors":[{"name":"Virgil Petcu","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Technology, University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Virgil","lastName":"Petcu","id":"38097836600"},{"name":"Oana Boncalo","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Technology, University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Oana","lastName":"Boncalo","id":"37396354200"},{"name":"Alexandru Amaricai","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Information Technology, University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Amaricai","id":"37396351700"},{"name":"Valentin Savin","affiliation":["MINATEC Campus, CEA-LETI, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Savin","id":"37605871100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1288-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1289-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7760912","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Throughput","Quantization (signal)","Computer architecture","Indexes","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","field programmable gate arrays","parallel architectures","parity check codes","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density parity-check code","hard-decision decoding","FPGA","processing node level","serial processing","parallel flooding architecture","single instruction multiple data approach","codewords","message representation","adaptive quantization","SIMD approach","LDPC decoder","variable throughput","word length 1 bit","word length 2 bit","word length 4 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FEC","LDPC","SIMD","multiple quantization","iterative decoding","design","flooding scheduling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an LDPC decoder design equipped with an adaptive throughput mechanism achievable using a multiple quantization scheme. Three representations are supported by the proposed architecture: 1-bit (hard decision), 2-bit, and 4-bit messages. A throughput increase by of factor of 4, 2 and 1 can be achieved with respect to the 4-bit message representation version, by simultaneously decoding 4, 2, or 1 codewords. This is done by employing a single instruction multiple data (SIMD) approach at processing unit level which is able to process 4, 2 and 1 operands corresponding to the distinct codewords. We provide implementation results for a partial parallel flooding architecture, with serial processing at processing node level. FPGA implementation results indicate that the proposed SIMD approach has an overhead of about 60% in logic with respect to the fixed 4-bit LDPC decoder, with no memory increase, while having a throughput increase of 4\u00d7 when the hard-decision decoding is used.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.7760912","publicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750937/7760810/07760912.pdf","startPage":"425","endPage":"428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.7760912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Variable throughput LDPC decoders using SIMD-based adaptive quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760912/","displayDocTitle":"Variable throughput LDPC decoders using SIMD-based adaptive quantization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16518059","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760912/","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable throughput LDPC decoders using SIMD-based adaptive quantization","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"09_036.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133389S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750937","isNumber":"7760810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750937","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760810","articleId":"7760912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760914,"authors":[{"name":"Zeliang Wang","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, UK"],"firstName":"Zeliang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085708912"},{"name":"Andr\u00e9 Sandmann","affiliation":["Hochschule Wismar, University of Applied Sciences-Technology, Business and Design, Wismar, Germany"],"firstName":"Andr\u00e9","lastName":"Sandmann","id":"37085645390"},{"name":"John G.

flexibility of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) as well as their parallel processing capabilities make them a good choice for digital signal processing in communication systems. However, today, further improvements in performance hang in mid-air as we run into the frequency wall and FPGA based devices are clocked below 1 GHz. New methodologies which can cater performance optimization within the frequency wall limitation become highly essential. In this context, efficient modulation techniques like Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and mixed time and frequency domain approach have been utilized in this paper to employ a generic scalable FPGA based QAM transmitter with the filter parallelization being executed in mixed domain. The system developed in this paper achieves a throughput of 4 Gb/s for QAM-16 format with a clock frequency as low as 62.5 MHz, thereby, paves down a promising methodology for applications where having higher clock frequencies is a hard limit.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.7760919","publicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750937/7760810/07760919.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.7760919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760810","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A variable FPGA based generic QAM transmitter with scalable mixed time and frequency domain signal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7760919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760919/","displayDocTitle":"A variable FPGA based generic QAM transmitter with scalable mixed time and frequency domain signal processing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16506238","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760919/","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A variable FPGA based generic QAM transmitter with scalable mixed time and frequency domain signal processing","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"09_256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060892S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750937","isNumber":"7760810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750937","xplore-issue":"7760810","articleId":"7760919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7760964,"authors":[{"name":"Se Young Chun","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Se Young","lastName":"Chun","id":"38252022400"},{"name":"Jae-Hwan Kang","affiliation":["School of Design and Human Engineering Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Hwan","lastName":"Kang","id":"38236944900"},{"name":"Hanvit Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hanvit","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085876038"},{"name":"Chungho Lee","affiliation":["School of Design and Human Engineering Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Chungho","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085778033"},{"name":"Ian Oakley","affiliation":["School of Design and Human Engineering Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Oakley","id":"37297698400"},{"name":"Sung-Phil Kim","affiliation":["School of Design and Human Engineering Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Phil","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085448576"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1288-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1289-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7760964","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":542},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Wearable sensors","Spectrogram","Authentication","Fourier transforms","Euclidean distance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECG based user authentication","wearable devices","short time Fourier transform","electrocardiogram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Biometric","ECG","phase information","short time Fourier transform","wearable device"]}],"abstract":"Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a promising biometric.

In the literature, it is typically assumed that a known attack modality will be perpetrated. Then liveness models are designed using labelled samples from both real/live and fake/spoof distributions, the latter derived from the assumed attack modality. In this work it is argued that a comprehensive modelling of the spoof samples is not possible in a real-world scenario where the attack modality cannot be known with a high degree of certainty. In fact making this assumption will render the liveness detection system more vulnerable to attacks that were not included in the original training. To provide a more realistic evaluation, this work proposes: a) testing the binary models with unknown spoof samples that were not present in the training step; b) the use of a single-class classification designing the classifier by modelling only the distribution of live samples. The results obtained support the assertion that many evaluation methods from the literature are misleading and may lead to optimistic estimates of the robustness of liveness detection in practical use cases.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.7760965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760810","startPage":"660","endPage":"664","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750937/7760810/07760965.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 39th International Conference on Telecommunications and Signal Processing (TSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.7760965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A realistic evaluation of iris presentation attack detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Iris recognition","Lenses","Databases","Testing","Biological system modeling","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","iris recognition","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iris presentation attack detection","iris liveness detection","iris biometric systems","spoofing attacks","spoof distributions","attack modality","binary models","single-class classification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["biometrics","iris","presentation attack","one-class classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 June 2016","displayDocTitle":"A realistic evaluation of iris presentation attack detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7760965/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7760965/","accessionNumber":"16506248","publicationDate":"June 2016","conferenceDate":"27-29 June 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A realistic evaluation of iris presentation attack detection","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"13_109.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070835S","chronDate":"27-29 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750937","isNumber":"7760810","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750937","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7760810","articleId":"7760965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7760981,"authors":[{"name":"Takeshi Tsujimura","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga-city, Japan"],"firstName":"Takeshi","lastName":"Tsujimura","id":"37295265200"},{"name":"Yuta Shimada","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga-city, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuta","lastName":"Shimada","id":"37085742814"},{"name":"Yuki Tashiro","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga-city, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuki","lastName":"Tashiro","id":"37085749683"},{"name":"Kiyotaka Izumi","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Saga University, Saga-city, Japan"],"firstName":"Kiyotaka","lastName":"Izumi","id":"37085379112"},{"name":"Koichi Yoshida","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Systems Engineering, Fukuoka Institute of Technology, Fukuoka-city, Japan"],"firstName":"Koichi","lastName":"Yoshida","id":"37287351300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1288-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1287-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1289-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7760981","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"abstract":"This paper describes optical axis adjustment technique for an active free space optics transmission system.

This paper proposes an arrival position presumption method of laser beam traveling along the long distance from transmitter. A positioning sensor containing several photodiodes measures laser luminescence distribution, and the optical axis of laser beam is analytically calculated according to a modified Gaussian beam optics.

assessment and control is critical challenge for investments in sediment cleanup as well as in the prevention of future contaminated sediment liabilities. The ubiquitous and non-point source nature of these sources make them difficult to effectively characterize and control while at the same time, regulatory pressure to reduce them and cleanup adjacent water bodies is increasing. Among the key challenges of stormwater compliance and characterization are: What are realistic exposure scenarios that are protective of the environment but not so conservative as to be impossible to achieve?; What is the fate and transport of the particulate fraction of these sources and their linkage to regional sediments that may be impacted by episodic discharges?; At what point are these sources sufficiently controlled to warrant large-scale investment in remediation of the adjacent sediments? Based on the requirements described above, the objective of this project is to demonstrate a family of technologies adapted from the oceanographic and environmental arenas that could significantly improve our ability to address contaminant source exposure, transport and fate challenges at coastal site in a relatively simple and cost effective way. Through the adaptation and integration of oceanographic drifter and scour cell techniques, we have developed three key technologies including: the Drifting Exposure System; the Drifting Particle Simulator; and, the Sediment Deposition Detector. These technologies provide a new set of capabilities that are highly applicable to characterizing the exposure, transport and fate of stormwater contaminant sources. Each of these technologies has undergone refinement and testing in the first year of the project and are now in the process of being demonstrated at field sites in San Diego Bay and Pearl Harbor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sediments","Global Positioning System","Sea surface","Ocean temperature","Sea measurements","Surface treatment","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Global Positioning System","remote sensing","sediments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPS drifter technology","stormwater plume tracking","source assessment","sediment liability","stormwater characterization","particulate transport","regional sediment","coastal site","scour cell technique","drifting exposure system","drifting particle simulator","sediment deposition detector","stormwater contaminant source exposure","stormwater contaminant source transport","San Diego bay","Pearl Harbor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stormwater","sediment","drifter","exposure","deposition"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761010","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761010.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPS drifter technologies for tracking and sampling stormwater plumes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761010","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"GPS drifter technologies for tracking and sampling stormwater plumes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761010/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761010/","accessionNumber":"16506083","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPS drifter technologies for tracking and sampling stormwater plumes","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160403-002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054167S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7761017,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Models predicting surface reflection loss, which degrades sonar performance, are generally derived assuming the surface shape is not varying over the time in which the pulse is reflecting from it and that the ensonified region of the surface is large in extent relative to the spatial correlation length of the surface. While these models are often appropriate for short-duration, narrowband pulses, they are not necessarily applicable to long-duration, broadband pulses which are the focus of this paper. By assuming the effective ensonified area is smaller in extent than the spatial correlation length, the surface reflection loss after matched filtering (MF) is derived as a function of pulse duration relative to surface wave period when the net surface displacement is Gaussian distributed. Closed-form results are obtained when the pulse is long relative to the surface-wave period and under the assumption that the bandwidth is small relative to the center frequency (i.e., a narrow-band model). As might be expected, the MF loss for the small-ensonified-area scenario increases with the Rayleigh roughness, the number of consecutive surface reflections, and the ratio between pulse duration and the surface wave period. With respect to the latter, the loss is predicted to saturate when the pulse duration exceeds one surface wave period. Finally, the models were found to compare favorably with real data measurements. The models presented in this paper should be useful in sonar-equation analysis for predicting surface reflection loss with broadband waveforms when pulse duration is on par with or exceeds the surface wave period.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7761017/","accessionNumber":"16517987","displayDocTitle":"Matched-filter loss from time-varying rough-surface reflection with a small ensonified area","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matched-filter loss from time-varying rough-surface reflection with a small ensonified area","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160405-003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055845S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7761051,"authors":[{"name":"Zheng Zheng","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zheng","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085700177"},{"name":"T.

Compressive sensing (CS) is utilized to estimate the times of arrival and is compared with matched filter (MF). It shows that CS obtains much higher resolution and lower sidelobes than MF. With the times of arrival estimated, a two-step procedure is employed to estimate the parameters of sediments. Firstly, the slopes of Head waves' arrival time versus ranges are used to calculate the compressional speeds of sediment layers. Secondly, the times of arrival of multipaths are used to calculate the thicknesses by simple ray tracing method. The two-step inversion offers a good match with true sediments' parameters.","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761051.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761051","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sediments parameters inversion from Head wave and multipath using compressive sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sediments","Receivers","Water resources","Compressed sensing","Ray tracing","Broadband communication","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","geophysical signal processing","matched filters","oceanographic techniques","sediments"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geoacoustic inversion","ray tracing method","matched filter","compressive sensing","multipaths","head waves","sediments parameters inversion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["geoacoustic inversion","Head wave","times of arrival","compressive sensing","matched filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Sediments parameters inversion from Head wave and multipath using compressive sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761051/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16518008","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sediments parameters inversion from Head wave and multipath using compressive sensing","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160419-002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045672S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761056,"authors":[{"name":"Tomohisa Wada","affiliation":["Dept. of Information Engineering, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Tomohisa","lastName":"Wada","id":"37305659900"},{"name":"Taisaku Suzuki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering and Science, Okinawa College, Nago-shi, Okinawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Taisaku","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"37085995138"},{"name":"Hiromasa Yamada","affiliation":["Oki Seatec Co., Ltd., Numazu-shi, Shizuoka"],"firstName":"Hiromasa","lastName":"Yamada","id":"37086060254"},{"name":"Shigeo Nakagawa","affiliation":["Oki Seatec Co., Ltd., Numazu-shi, Shizuoka"],"firstName":"Shigeo","lastName":"Nakagawa","id":"37086062463"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1537-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1527-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761056","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Receivers","Communication systems","Doppler shift","Underwater acoustics","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler shift","error statistics","OFDM modulation","signal processing","time-domain analysis","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic QAM OFDM communication system","robust Doppler compensation","Doppler shift","OFDM receiver","maximum-ratio combining algorithm","MRC algorithm","Ocean measurement","ultrasonic OFDM channel","subcarrier spacing","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Underwater","Acoustic Communication","OFDM","MRC","Doppler compensation"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an underwater acoustic OFDM communication system to transmit image or movie data from deep see AUV etc. to surface ship.

By performing experiment in the ocean at depth of 1000m, BER of approximately less than 1E-2 has been successfully obtained using 64QAM without any error correction.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761056","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761056.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An underwater acoustic 64QAM OFDM communication system with robust Doppler compensation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761056/","displayDocTitle":"An underwater acoustic 64QAM OFDM communication system with robust Doppler compensation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16506133","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761056/","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An underwater acoustic 64QAM OFDM communication system with robust Doppler compensation","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160419-009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050198S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761056","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761083,"authors":[{"name":"Irina Murgan","affiliation":["University of Grenoble-Alpes, GIPSA-lab, France"],"firstName":"Irina","lastName":"Murgan","id":"37085999458"},{"name":"Angela Digulescu","affiliation":["University of Grenoble-Alpes, GIPSA-lab, France","Military Technical Academy, Bucharest, Romania"],"firstName":"Angela","lastName":"Digulescu","id":"38468108200"},{"name":"Ion Candel","affiliation":["University of Grenoble-Alpes, GIPSA-lab, France"],"firstName":"Ion","lastName":"Candel","id":"38075480100"},{"name":"Cornel Ioana","affiliation":["University of Grenoble-Alpes, GIPSA-lab, France"],"firstName":"Cornel","lastName":"Ioana","id":"37285060800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1537-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1527-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761083","dbTime":"27 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":86},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Compressed sensing","Sensors","Time of arrival estimation","Matched filters","Time-frequency analysis","Acoustic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic receivers","acoustic transducers","acoustic wave propagation","compressed sensing","direction-of-arrival estimation","matched filters","time-of-arrival estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic transducer position offset compensation","compressive sensing reconstruction","warped domain","underwater acoustics","direction of arrival estimation","source detection","source localization","transmitter-receiver transducer configuration","water flow operational conditions","signal propagation","missing spectral information recovery","time of arrival estimation","matched filter response improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["compressive sensing","warping transform","time of arrival estimation","matched filter"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a new technique for acoustic transducers position offset compensation, based on compressive sensing reconstruction in the warped domain. In underwater acoustics, the transducers relative position is important for applications involving direction of arrival estimation, localization or source detection. When the transmitter-receiver transducers configuration is inappropriate, the received signal's informational content is not the same as the one of the emitted signal. In the case of applications such as underwater objects tracking, the experimental setup constraints and the water flow operational conditions lead to the perturbation of the emitted and received signals propagation. We use compressive sensing reconstruction of the received signal, in the warped domain, in order to recover its missing spectral information due to wave's propagation. Tests were conducted in a reduced scale experimental facility, in order to prove the interest of using the signal compressive sensing recovery for the signal's time of arrival estimation and to quantify the improvement introduced by this signal processing method. The results show that the time of arrival estimation can be considerably improved after the received signal's samples recovery, with the matched filter response improvement.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761083","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761083.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761083","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of position offset of acoustic transducers using compressive sensing concept","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761083","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of position offset of acoustic transducers using compressive sensing concept","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761083/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16506070","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7761083/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of position offset of acoustic transducers using compressive sensing concept","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160421-021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044712S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761083","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761116,"authors":[{"name":"Shunde Zhao","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technique, Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi\u2019 an, China"],"lastName":"Shunde Zhao","id":"37087464029"},{"name":"Xin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technique, Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi\u2019 an, China"],"lastName":"Xin Zhang","id":"37087190868"},{"name":"Xiaoji Zhang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technique, Northwestern Poly technical University, Xi\u2019 an, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoji Zhang","id":"37087463519"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1537-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1527-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761116","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":236},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761116","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Decoding","Frequency-domain analysis","Decision feedback equalizers","Underwater acoustics","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","convergence","decision feedback equalisers","frequency-domain analysis","iterative decoding","parity check codes","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convergence","decision signals","iterative equalization","iterative LDPC decoding","IB-DFE","iterative block decision feedback equalizer","Turbo conception","LDPC decoder","low-density parity-check code","severe time-dispersive channels","single-carrier underwater acoustic communications","iterative frequency domain equalization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["single-carrier frequency domain equalization","iterative block decision feedback equalizer","low density parity-check code","underwater acoustic communication"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the detection schemes for single-carrier underwater acoustic communications over the severe time-dispersive channels.

The external messages are fully exchanged between the IB-DFE and the decoder during the processing of the joint iterative equalization and decoding. The numerical results demonstrate that the decision signals with higher reliability from the LDPC decoder accelerate the convergence of the equalizer and enhance the detection performance, yielding up to 6 dB performance gains when compared with the scheme without LDPC code.

Simulation experiments with two AUVs, comparing no data sharing with timed surfacing for data sharing, show that the system performs better when data is shared. We further explore the trade-off between using high-bandwidth surface Wi-Fi communications, at the cost of surfacing, and low-bandwidth underwater acoustic communications (acomms).

The success of sparse recovery methods, however, heavily depends on whether the received samples admit an exactly sparse representation in some transform space. To this end, it should be noted that the transmit and receive filtering in a communication system may introduce a smearing/blurring effect due to convolution, which can cause the overall cascade of transmit and receive filters with the actual channel impulse response to exhibit only approximate sparsity. This places severe limitations on the accuracy of ordinary sparse estimation techniques. Thus the effect of transmit (Tx) and receive (Rx) filtering on sparse channel estimation deserves a careful analysis, one which is lacking in the literature, and this is the focus of this paper. In particular, we present an optimality condition on the selection of Tx-Rx filtering characteristics, and investigate the \u201csuper-resolution\u201d condition from a signals&systems point of view. It is verified and demonstrated by experiments that the satisfiability of the super-resolution condition has a significant impact on sparse channel estimation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of filtering on the resolution of sparsity in channel estimation for OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761144","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761144.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761144","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761144","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761144/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"The impact of filtering on the resolution of sparsity in channel estimation for OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761144/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517984","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of filtering on the resolution of sparsity in channel estimation for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160422-057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060776S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761144","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761145,"authors":[{"name":"Ula\u015f G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn","affiliation":["Ultra Maritime Digital Communications Centre (UMDCC.ca), Halifax, NS, B3H 4R2, Canada"],"firstName":"Ula\u015f","lastName":"G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn"},{"name":"Christian Schlegel","affiliation":["Ultra Maritime Digital Communications Centre (UMDCC.ca), Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schlegel","id":"37275119900"},{"name":"Dmitri Truhachev","affiliation":["Ultra Maritime Digital Communications Centre (UMDCC.ca), Halifax, NS, Canada"],"firstName":"Dmitri","lastName":"Truhachev","id":"37284375300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1537-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1527-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761145","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":253},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","OFDM","Bayes methods","Estimation","Channel estimation","Training","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","Kalman filters","OFDM modulation","tracking filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compression-aided Kalman filter","recursive Bayesian estimation","sparse wideband channels","OFDM systems","wideband wireless propagation media","millimeter-wave acoustic channels","underwater acoustic channels","sparse impulse response","sparse character","compressed sensing","sequential Bayesian estimation","sparse channels","compressible channels","Kalman tracking filter","propagation environment","header symbols","sparsity pattern","support locations","dynamic evolution","discrete-time channel taps"]}],"abstract":"Many wideband wireless propagation media, including millimeter-wave and underwater acoustic channels, exhibit sparse impulse responses. Exploiting the sparse character of such channels using compressed sensing techniques can potentially lead to substantial savings in pilot overhead. In this paper, we address sequential Bayesian estimation of sparse/compressible channels with a Kalman tracking filter termed the \u201cCompression-Aided Kalman Filter (C-A KF)\u201d. As opposed to much of the previous work on Bayesian compressed sensing, our approach is not built on a hierarchical or hypothesis-testing method for the modeling of a priori information. Rather, we acquire a priori information directly from the propagation environment by employing header symbols in order to derive the sparsity pattern, i.e., support locations, and the dynamic evolution of the discrete-time channel taps. Based on a priori information extracted by the header symbols, we develop a state-space pair for the CA KF. Our experimental results suggest that the proposed C-A KF algorithm leads to significant reductions in pilot overhead, regardless of how rapidly the underlying channel conditions may change.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compression-Aided Kalman Filter for recursive Bayesian estimation of sparse wideband channels in OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761145","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761145.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761145","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761145/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Compression-Aided Kalman Filter for recursive Bayesian estimation of sparse wideband channels in OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761145/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517934","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compression-Aided Kalman Filter for recursive Bayesian estimation of sparse wideband channels in OFDM systems","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160422-058.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072333S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761145","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761146,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Marburg","affiliation":["Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington"],"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Marburg","id":"37659702700"},{"name":"Katie Bigham","affiliation":["Department of Oceanography, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington"],"firstName":"Katie","lastName":"Bigham","id":"37086111525"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1537-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1527-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761146","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761146","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Google","Biological system modeling","Marine animals","Machine learning","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biology","convolution","feature extraction","identification","image classification","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["deep learning","benthic fauna identification","convolutional neural network","CNN","machine learning algorithm","image patch extraction","fauna classification"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the identification and classification of ten classes of benthic macrofauna in high-resolution photomosaics captured on the Pacific continental shelf by an ROV. Each photomosaic was previously hand-annotated with the location and classification of each animal, providing a training set for the machine learning algorithms. These annotations are used to extract image patches around each contact, resulting in approximately 5000 image samples, which are supplemented with randomly selected image patches representing the background. The resulting corpus of data is used to train a series of convolutional neural networks in the Nvidia DIGITS and Google Tensorflow environments. Due to the relatively sparse nature of the training data set, a number of data augmentation approaches are used to increase the diversity of training data. The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated in three problem scenarios: first, classification of fauna in an image patch known to contain a target; second, classification of a given image patch as either background or non-background; and third, a single-pass combination of the two problems. The presented networks prove highly accurate at background/non-background segmentation with ~96% accuracy. Fauna identification is less reliable at ~89% accuracy, and unified segmentation and identification proves to be the most challenging at ~88% accuracy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761146","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761146.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deep learning for benthic fauna identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deep learning for benthic fauna identification","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7761146/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16505933","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761146/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep learning for benthic fauna identification","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160422-062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.178271S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7761209,"authors":[{"name":"Juhwan Kim","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Juhwan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085645943"},{"name":"Hyeonwoo Cho","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyeonwoo","lastName":"Cho","id":"37576139600"},{"name":"Juhyun Pyo","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Juhyun","lastName":"Pyo","id":"38468207200"},{"name":"Byeongjin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byeongjin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085634142"},{"name":"Son-Cheol Yu","affiliation":["Department of Creative IT Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH), Pohang, Gyeongbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Son-Cheol","lastName":"Yu","id":"37422355300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1537-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1527-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761209","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":813},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Neural networks","Sonar detection","Machine learning algorithms","Object detection","Object recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous underwater vehicles","convolution","neurocontrollers","object detection","object recognition","robot vision","sonar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolution neural network","agent vehicle detection","forward-looking sonar image","underwater object recognition","underwater object detection","agent vehicle localization","small ROV","underwater vehicle system","autonomous underwater vehicle","AUV","CNN based object recognition","underwater robotics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Object recognition","Object detection","Forwardlooking sonar","Machine learning","Neural network","Agent vehicle"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761209","abstract":"We propose the convolution neural network (CNN) based underwater object recognition and detection solution using forward-looking sonar image for localization of agent vehicle (small ROV).

Unlike traditional methods which suppress cross-correlation functions (CCFs) between transmitting waveforms as low as possible, we use band overlapped frequency diverse continuous wave (FDCW) pulses to obtain relatively high CCFs. We point out that these relatively high CCFs can fill the band gap between auto-correlation functions (ACFs) between neighboring FDCW pulses, thereby showing an ability of reducing the spectrum leakage. Furthermore, we apply an amplitude weight vector to these FDCW pulses to further reduce the spectrum leakage and hence, produce much low range sidelobes.

It is, however, rarely investigated in underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. This paper presents an SC-FDMA transceiver scheme for multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) UWA communications, and studies the performance of turbo equalization on the receiver side. The signalling of the pilot symbols bypasses the DFT precoding module, so the channel estimation and the carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation are performed in a similar way as in a conventional OFDM system. A recently proposed high-performance frequency-domain turbo equalization technique is adopted for detecting the data symbols, which suffer inter-symbol interference (ISI) due to the DFT spreading operation.

Limiting biofouling on long-duration AUVs is essential to the success of the flight. Inverse relationships and correlations were drawn between biofouling, vertical velocity of the AUV, and in turn, steering capability. As organisms settle and grow on the AUV, the hydrodynamics of the vessel changed, resulting in larger volume and more drag, adding buoyancy discrepancies as well. The increased drag results in a lower vertical velocity, and therefore less water flow over the rudder, or fin, directly causing the reduction in steering capability. Additionally, the organisms were not evenly distributed about the AUV, causing an imbalance in the drag. The fin then needed to maintain an offset to counteract this imbalance, resulting in less overall range in fin movement, further reducing the ability to steer. Analysis of the data from four separate legs of ocean basin crossings has shown that as the AUV begins to foul, it needs to maintain a vertical velocity of greater than 12 cm/s to maintain viable steering. Overall the fin will move more as it attempts to compensate for biofouling, which will use additional power throughout the duration of the flight, bringing power budgets back into the equation. Although the biofouling issues facing long-duration AUVs are subject to the same settling processes as boats and ships, porting commercially available antifoulant technologies from larger, faster vessels to the AUVs has proven challenging. Non-like metals combined with biofilms can result in increased galvanic corrosion, so copper coating compounds on steel components and aluminum AUV hull are not ideal, particularly with limited space and weight for sacrificial anodes. Ablative paints, by design, can wear away, causing possible ballast issues while failing to prevent fouling. Biocides, for obvious reasons, have not been in the list of candidates for consideration in the ongoing battle against biological growth. We introduced some behavioral modifications in the flight characteristics of the AUV that provided some assistance. For example, we avoided the majority of the warmer and illuminated euphotic zone, where primary production occurred, or zones above a certain temperature range that could hamper organism growth, even if it was not possible to prevent settling. This paper will explore the differences in biofouling, flight environment, preventative measures, and lessons learned on the four legs of ocean basin crossings completed by two separate Slocum electric gliders, part of the Rutgers AUV fleet.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761236","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761236.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lessening biofouling on long-duration AUV flights: Behavior modifications and lessons learned","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Lessening biofouling on long-duration AUV flights: Behavior modifications and lessons learned","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761236/","accessionNumber":"16505923","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761236/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lessening biofouling on long-duration AUV flights: Behavior modifications and lessons learned","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160424-067.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049667S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761236","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7761245,"authors":[{"name":"Hemonth G.

Wide dynamic range receivers are necessary to operate through a range of possible water qualities and link distances. In the signal-starved regime, photon-counting photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are a key technology for high-sensitivity communications. When more signal is available, linear avalanche photodiodes (APDs) provide an opportunity for higher-rate communication. We have designed a receiver terminal employing both kinds of detectors to show robust operation over nearly two orders of magnitude in power and data rate. An optical link including this receiver terminal was submerged in Narragansett Bay, RI to demonstrate underwater optical communication over several days. The PMT receiver demonstrated robust, error-free performance over channel rates from 1.302 Mbaud to 10.416 Mbaud for received optical power levels ranging from -84.1 dBm to -75.3 dBm. The PMT link demonstrated an error-free user rate of 8.68 Mb/s. This corresponded to nearly-ideal detector efficiency on the order of one detected photon per bit. The PMT receiver was contained entirely within the submerged enclosure and demonstrated full real-time decoding, including strong forward error correction. A low-power transmitter was used to demonstrate a link with loss equivalent to 18 extinction lengths. With moderately-powered transmitters, this distance could be extended to 22.4 extinction lengths. The PMT receiver was capable of operating at near-theoretical limits during the day and night. Its multi-rate operation demonstrated the capability of trading sensitivity for data rate efficiently. With the same low-power transmitter, the APD receiver achieved a bit error rate less than 1\u00d710\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-9</sup>\n at 125 Mbaud.

The MML selects for further investigation the tracks which are likely originated by a target. In this case, the MML launches a receding horizon, non-myopic control algorithm which controls the AUV's heading to improve the tracking performance to ease the target classification. The algorithm minimises the expected target position estimation error over a prediction time window by achieving a trade-off amongst different objectives: keeping the target at broadside, reducing the distance to the target, avoiding areas of high reverberation and searching for geometric configurations with low bistatic target localisation error. We report at-sea experiments obtained during the LCAS15 sea trial, which demonstrated, for the first time, that the proposed autonomy architecture can be executed together with real-time Continuous Active Sonar (CAS) processing on-board the AUVs. CAS has recently gained interest for littoral Anti-Submarine Warfare, since it offers the promise of multiple detections per waveform cycle. This can potentially improve the quality/length of tracks, thus increasing the adaptive behaviour's performance, which, in turn, can increase the detection and tracking capabilities of the processing chain.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761247","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761247.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A data-driven control strategy in synergy with Continuous Active Sonar for littoral underwater surveillance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A data-driven control strategy in synergy with Continuous Active Sonar for littoral underwater surveillance","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761247/","accessionNumber":"16506059","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761247/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A data-driven control strategy in synergy with Continuous Active Sonar for littoral underwater surveillance","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160424-084.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054563S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7761274,"authors":[{"name":"Yixin Yang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Yixin","lastName":"Yang","id":"37280589200"},{"name":"Long Yang","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Long","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085391531"},{"name":"Jiannan Zhu","affiliation":["School of Marine Science and Technology, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Jiannan","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37086208325"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1537-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1527-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761274","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":304},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761274","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Broadband communication","Robustness","Convex functions","Time-domain analysis","Acoustic beams","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","convex programming","time-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sidelobe suppression","low sidelobe level time-domain adaptive broadband beamforming","direction of arrival mismatch","convex optimization problem","convex optimization software","DOA mismatch"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time-domain broadband beamforming","sparse constraint","sidelobe suppression","robustness against DOA mismatch"]}],"doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761274","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761274.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sidelobe suppression for time-domain adaptive broadband beamforming with sparse constraint","abstract":"A low sidelobe level time-domain adaptive broadband beamforming is proposed in this paper by adding a sparse constraint on the output beam pattern.

We discuss some of the ways oceanographers and marine scientists across a variety of disciplines are working to understand how they can best utilize shipboard HPC capabilities for data-intensive operational oceanography. Fundamentally, a comprehensive understanding of the ocean's complex biophysical and geochemical dynamics relies heavily on numeric modeling. While oceanographic data are collected at sea, their assimilation into models conventionally takes place ashore, where computing resources are readily available. Due to limitations of data transmission cost and bandwidth, this approach creates delays with data integration and makes it hard to adjust the course of spatial and GIS-based operational oceanographic observations in response to insights from the incoming data. To shorten feedback between observations and modeling, and provide researchers with better visibility into observed processes through visualization and dissemination of data via Cloud Services, Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI) installed a high performance computing (HPC) system on RV FALKOR (Fig. 1) in January of 2015, making her the first research vessel with a supercomputing system freely available to the global oceanographic community.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ship-based cloud computing for advancing oceanographic research capabilities","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761339","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761339.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761339","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Ship-based cloud computing for advancing oceanographic research capabilities","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761339/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517976","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ship-based cloud computing for advancing oceanographic research capabilities","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160502-004.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080142S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761342,"authors":[{"name":"Young-Sik Shin","affiliation":["Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, KAIST, S.

This is thanks to its simplicity and suitable performance in linear or linearized plants, and under certain conditions, in nonlinear ones. A number of PID controller gains tuning approaches have been proposed in the literature in the last decades; most of them off-line techniques. However, in those cases wherein plants are subject to continuous parametric changes or external disturbances, online gains tuning is a need. This is the case of modular underwater ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) where parameters (weight, buoyancy, added mass, among others) change according to the tool they are fitted with. In practice, some amount of time is dedicated to tune the PID gains of a ROV. Once the best set of gains has been achieved the ROV is ready to work. However, when the vehicle changes its tool or it is subject to ocean currents, its performance deteriorates since the fixed set of gains is no longer valid for the new conditions. Thus, an online PID gains tuning algorithm should be implemented to overcome this problem. In this paper, an auto-tuned PID-like controller based on Neural Networks (NN) is proposed. The NN plays the role of automatically estimating the suitable set of PID gains that achieves stability of the system. The NN adjusts online the controller gains that attain the smaller position tracking error. Simulation results are given considering an underactuated 6 DOF (degrees of freedom) underwater ROV. Real time experiments on an underactuated mini ROV are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761412","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761412.pdf","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-tuned PID control based on backpropagation Neural Networks for underwater vehicles","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["PI control","PD control","Artificial neural networks","Tuning","Biological neural networks","Neurons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","autonomous underwater vehicles","backpropagation","neurocontrollers","self-adjusting systems","stability","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underactuated mini ROV","underactuated 6 DOF underwater ROV","position tracking error","stability","autotuned PID-like controller","online PID gain tuning algorithm","remotely operated vehicles","underwater vehicles","backpropagation neural networks","self-tuned PID control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Auto-tuning","PID Control","Neural Network","Back-propagation Algorithm","Disturbances"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761412/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Self-tuned PID control based on backpropagation Neural Networks for underwater vehicles","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761412/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16517847","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-tuned PID control based on backpropagation Neural Networks for underwater vehicles","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160509-037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044549S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7761431,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A detection method for SeaSonde systems (of which 600 now operate worldwide) has shown how the unique (but often weak) tsunami signal can be pulled out of background currents and noise by a \u201cq-factor\u201d pattern recognition algorithm. As with any event detector, one must trade off probability of detection with false alarm rate. We developed and describe here a simulator, that allows one to optimize tsunami performance based on local bathymetry and background conditions. Running on real-time systems in the field, it correlates false-alarm and detection probabilities with the background, injecting a simulated model-derived tsunami signal into noise and echo normally used for current mapping. This allows optimizing algorithm performance and detection thresholds masked by background. Minimal tsunami-intensity is predictable at a given site. Filters that correlate alert spikes with other information (e.g., seismic events) further reduce false alarms, so that robust warnings are passed along to our TWCs (tsunami warning centers). Our company has begun an official partnership with NOAA's NWS and NOS to evolve this capability into TWC operations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulator to evaluate tsunami warning performance for coastal HF radars","publicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761447","displayPublicationTitle":"OCEANS 2016 MTS/IEEE Monterey","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750936/7760990/07761447.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.2016.7761447","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7760990","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761447","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761447/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Simulator to evaluate tsunami warning performance for coastal HF radars","conferenceDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761447/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16505921","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulator to evaluate tsunami warning performance for coastal HF radars","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"160511-028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043695S","chronDate":"19-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750936","isNumber":"7760990","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750936","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7760990","articleId":"7761447","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761479,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua Baghdady","affiliation":["Holcombe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Joshua","lastName":"Baghdady","id":"37085642990"},{"name":"Joseph Kelly","affiliation":["Holcombe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Joseph","lastName":"Kelly","id":"37086201399"},{"name":"Keith Miller","affiliation":["Holcombe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Keith","lastName":"Miller","id":"37085634313"},{"name":"Kaitlyn Morgan","affiliation":["Holcombe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Kaitlyn","lastName":"Morgan","id":"37085642675"},{"name":"Wenzhe Li","affiliation":["Holcombe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina, USA"],"lastName":"Wenzhe Li","id":"37085648197"},{"name":"Eric Johnson","affiliation":["Holcombe Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, South Carolina, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Johnson","id":"37085447240"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1537-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1527-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761479","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Laser beams","Multiplexing","Optical fiber communication","Space vehicles","Optical receivers","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angular momentum","optical links","space division multiplexing","underwater optical wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater optical communication link","orbital angular momentum space division multiplexing","OAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical communications","Orbital Angular Momentum","GaN laser diodes","Space Division Multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"This work demonstrates an underwater optical link utilizing Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM).

We propose using two deep CNNs, and each of which is capable of solving a particular mission-oriented task to form parallel classification models.

We introduce a novel approach for the voxelization of solid objects, designed for Graphics Processing Units (GPU). The method is based on a heuristic approach that computes an approximate distance field instead of using mesh surface normals or exact point-to-triangle distances. Two main steps are required: voxel marking and distance field computation. In the first step, each voxel is marked based on its location relative to the mesh (inside, outside of the domain or on its boundary), and, during the second step, a signed distance field is computed. Experiments focused on meshes encountered in medical imaging applications: a left ventricle and a coronary artery. The proposed method is found to be exceptionally robust as it is able to handle meshes with severe defects such as self intersections and holes. The GPU based implementation is on average 20 times faster than the multi-core CPU based implementation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"GPU accelerated, robust method for voxelization of solid objects","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","doi":"10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761582","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7748303/7761574/07761582.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7761574","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761582","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761582/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"GPU accelerated, robust method for voxelization of solid objects","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761582/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504611","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"GPU accelerated, robust method for voxelization of solid objects","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"106.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076517S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7748303","isNumber":"7761574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7748303","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7761574","articleId":"7761582","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761588,"authors":[{"name":"Sang-Woo Jun","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, US"],"firstName":"Sang-Woo","lastName":"Jun"},{"name":"Huy T.

Because of its computational complexity, spike sorting is generally carried out offline or, at least, using a transmitted signal. In contrast, in-brain spike sorting would reduce the data that needs to be transmitted by orders of magnitude with a corresponding reduction in transmission power. This would enable real-time wireless neural recordings. In this paper, we design and characterize a hardware prototype for in-brain spike sorting. Our design is able to reduce the wireless transmission power by a factor of over 200 over direct transmission. Also, compared with the current state-of-the-art, our design increases the sorting accuracy from 75% to 93% while remaining within hard constraints for power, power density, and real-time processing.","doi":"10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761590","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7748303/7761574/07761590.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761590","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7761574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hardware design for in-brain neural spike sorting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761590","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761590/","displayDocTitle":"A hardware design for in-brain neural spike sorting","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504629","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7761590/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hardware design for in-brain neural spike sorting","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054083S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7748303","isNumber":"7761574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7748303","xplore-issue":"7761574","articleId":"7761590","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761593,"authors":[{"name":"Saurabh Hukerikar","affiliation":["Computer Science and Mathematics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Saurabh","lastName":"Hukerikar","id":"38468083700"},{"name":"Christian Engelmann","affiliation":["Computer Science and Mathematics Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Engelmann","id":"37296621200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3525-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3526-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761593","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":77},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","Robustness","Resource management","Libraries","Integrated circuit reliability","Resilience"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","parallel processing","software reliability","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Havens","reliable memory regions","HPC applications","error resilience","exascale-class supercomputing systems","hardware-based detection","software-based parity protection","fault tolerance"]}],"abstract":"Supporting error resilience in future exascale-class supercomputing systems is a critical challenge. Due to transistor scaling trends and increasing memory density, scientific simulations are expected to experience more interruptions caused by transient errors in the system memory. Existing hardware-based detection and recovery techniques will be inadequate to manage the presence of high memory fault rates. In this paper we propose a partial memory protection scheme based on region-based memory management. We define the concept of regions called havens that provide fault protection for program objects. We provide reliability for the regions through a software-based parity protection mechanism. Our approach enables critical program objects to be placed in these havens. The fault coverage provided by our approach is application agnostic, unlike algorithm-based fault tolerance techniques.","doi":"10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761593","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7748303/7761574/07761593.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7761574","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Havens: Explicit reliable memory regions for HPC applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Havens: Explicit reliable memory regions for HPC applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761593/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504656","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7761593/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Havens: Explicit reliable memory regions for HPC applications","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10585S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7748303","isNumber":"7761574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7748303","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7761574","articleId":"7761593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761598,"authors":[{"name":"Khadeer Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Khadeer","lastName":"Ahmed","id":"38235828000"},{"name":"Qinru Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Qinru","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37267088600"},{"name":"Mangesh Tamhankar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Mangesh","lastName":"Tamhankar","id":"37086204254"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3525-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3526-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761598","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":72},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761598","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Computer architecture","Software","Pipeline processing","Hardware","Neuromorphics","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer architecture","computer software","distributed processing","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed architecture","configurable architecture","neuromorphic applications","heterogeneous cluster","processor architectures","complex software application modularization","data dependencies","software application flexibility","hardware platforms","resource management","throughput system scaling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed computing","structure based scheduling","heterogeneous computing","pipelining","latency hiding","modularization"]}],"abstract":"With the proliferation of application specific accelerators, the use of heterogeneous clusters is rapidly increasing. Consisting of processors with different architectures, a heterogeneous cluster aims at providing different performance and cost tradeoffs for different types of workloads.

We propose a design methodology to modularize complex software applications with data dependencies. The software application designed in this way have the flexibility to be reconfigured for different hardware platforms to facilitate resource management, and features high scalability and parallelism. Using a neuromorphic application as a case study, we present the concept of modularization and discuss the management, scheduling and communication of the modules.

The high bandwidth provided by 3D memories does not translate to a proportional increase in performance for all applications. For an application such as 2D FFT with strided access patterns, the data layout of the memory has a significant impact on the total execution time of the implementation. In this paper, we present a data layout for 2D FFT on 3D memory integrated FPGA that is both on-chip memory efficient as well as throughput-optimal. Our data layout ensures that consecutive accesses to 3D memory are sufficiently interleaved among layers and vaults to absorb latency due to activation overheads for both sequential (Row FFT) and strided (Column FFT) accesses. The current state-of-the-art implementation on 3D memory requires O(\u221acN) on-chip memory to reduce the strided accesses and achieve maximum bandwidth for an N \u00d7 N FFT problem size and c columns in a 3D memory bank row. Our proposed data layout optimizes the throughput of both the Row FFT and Column FFT phases of 2D FFT with O(N) on-chip memory for the same problem size and memory parameters without decreasing the memory bandwidth thereby achieving a \u221ac\u00d7 reduction in on-chip memory. On architectures with limited on-chip memory, our data layout achieves 2\u00d7 to 4\u00d7 improvement in execution time compared with the state-of-art 2D FFT implementation on 3D memory.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7748303/7761574/07761606.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-chip memory efficient data layout for 2D FFT on 3D memory integrated FPGA","doi":"10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761606","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7761574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"On-chip memory efficient data layout for 2D FFT on 3D memory integrated FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504643","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7761606/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-chip memory efficient data layout for 2D FFT on 3D memory integrated FPGA","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084442S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7748303","isNumber":"7761574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7748303","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7761574","articleId":"7761606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761614,"authors":[{"name":"Janki Bhimani","affiliation":["Northeastern University"],"firstName":"Janki","lastName":"Bhimani","id":"37085710949"},{"name":"Miriam Leeser","affiliation":["Northeastern University"],"firstName":"Miriam","lastName":"Leeser","id":"37265508400"},{"name":"Ningfang Mi","affiliation":["Northeastern University"],"firstName":"Ningfang","lastName":"Mi","id":"37603427400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3525-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3526-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761614","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Random access memory","Kernel","Benchmark testing","Data transfer","Hardware","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","data handling","graphics processing units","peripheral interfaces","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design space exploration","GPU accelerated cluster system","optimal data transfer","PCIe bus","memory allocation","overlapping concurrency","parallel computation","software version","programming language driver","high level design decision guidelines","data transfer optimization","CPU","device GPU","NVIDIA GPU"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design Guidelines","Data Transfer","PCIe bus","NVIDIA GPUs","Micro Benchmark Versions"]}],"abstract":"Use of accelerators such as GPUs is increasing, but efficient use of GPUs requires making good design choices. Such design choices include type of memory allocation and overlapping concurrency of data transfer with parallel computation. Performance varies with the application, hardware version such as generation of GPU, and software version including programming language drivers. This large number of design decisions makes it nearly impossible to obtain the optimal performance point by directly porting any application. This emphasizes the need for high level design decision guidelines for GPU accelerated cluster systems, applicable to a broad class of applications rather than any specific application. This paper proposes novel design guidelines for GPU accelerated cluster systems, to optimize the data transfer from host (CPU) to device (GPU) using the PCIe bus. In particular, we consider design choices offered by NVIDIA GPUs. Our main contribution is to build design guidelines that are applicable to a broad class of applications. We design 27 different versions of the same micro benchmark, where the design choices made by each version is unique. We observe that a speedup of 2.6x can be obtained just by making good design choices.","doi":"10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761614","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7748303/7761574/07761614.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761614","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7761574","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design space exploration of GPU Accelerated cluster systems for optimal data transfer using PCIe bus","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761614","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Design space exploration of GPU Accelerated cluster systems for optimal data transfer using PCIe bus","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761614/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504636","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7761614/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design space exploration of GPU Accelerated cluster systems for optimal data transfer using PCIe bus","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057346S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7748303","isNumber":"7761574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7748303","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7761574","articleId":"7761614","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761620,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Bisson","affiliation":["NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mauro","lastName":"Bisson","id":"37587396400"},{"name":"Everett Phillips","affiliation":["NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Everett","lastName":"Phillips","id":"37392820100"},{"name":"Massimiliano Fatica","affiliation":["NVIDIA Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Massimiliano","lastName":"Fatica","id":"37392830500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3525-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3526-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761620","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Benchmark testing","Graphics processing units","Pipelines","Sparse matrices","Sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","graphics processing units","parallel architectures","pipeline processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CUDA implementation","PageRank pipeline benchmark","Big Data system capabilities","GPU accelerated systems","Big Data workloads"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the details of a CUDA implementation of the PageRank pipeline benchmark [1], a new proposed benchmark aimed to compare and measure the capabilities of big data systems.

Unfortunately, due to its very low ratio of computation to memory access SpMV is inherently a memory bound problem. On the other hand, the main memory bandwidth of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) architectures is insufficient for available computation resources on these platforms, well known as the memory wall problem. As a result, COTS architectures are unsuitable for SpMV. Furthermore, SpMV requires random access into a memory space which is far too big for cache. Hence, it becomes difficult to utilize the main memory bandwidth which is already scarce. We propose an algorithm for large SpMV problems which is specially optimized to fully exploit the underlying micro-architecture and overall system capabilities. This algorithm is implemented in two steps. The key feature of the first step is that it converts all the main memory random access into streaming access. This reduces the overall data transfer volume significantly and ensures full utilization of the memory bandwidth. On top of that, we propose a meta-data compression technique, namely Variable Length Delta Index (VLDI), to decrease the data transfer volume even further. VLDI is particularly effective for sparse matrices where meta-data to payload ratio is high, e.g. sparse bit matrices.","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7748303/7761574/07761633.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"3D DRAM based application specific hardware accelerator for SpMV","doi":"10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7761574","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HPEC.2016.7761633","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761633/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"3D DRAM based application specific hardware accelerator for SpMV","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16504659","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"3D DRAM based application specific hardware accelerator for SpMV","confLoc":"Waltham, MA, USA","sourcePdf":"75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029563S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","isNumber":"7761574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7748303","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7761633","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7761639,"authors":[{"name":"Alan D.

The results show that over the range of 0.5 GHz-5.5 GHz, the gain can be tuned from 15.5 dB to 19.6 dB, input and output return loss are better than -10 dB, the NF is less than 5 dB, and the total chip size is reduced dramatically.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761694/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7761694/","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16505771","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Variable gain broadband low noise amplifier using tunable active inductor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Variable gain broadband low noise amplifier using tunable active inductor","confLoc":"Beijing","sourcePdf":"MPP_20_136_7_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045618S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750913","isNumber":"7761650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750913","xplore-issue":"7761650","articleId":"7761694","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7761698,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Cao","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jia Cao","id":"37086063369"},{"name":"Zhiqun Li","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Zhiqun Li","id":"37537160400"},{"name":"Jianwei Tian","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Jianwei Tian","id":"37086063863"},{"name":"Hao Liu","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai, China"],"lastName":"Hao Liu","id":"37086062728"},{"name":"Qin Li","affiliation":["China"],"lastName":"Qin Li","id":"37086062758"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8983-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-8984-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7761698","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":619},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761698","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Wideband","Inductors","Gain","Semiconductor device measurement","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","integrated circuit layout","low noise amplifiers","low-power electronics","millimetre wave amplifiers","monolithic integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gain peaking techniques","low power high gain low noise amplifier","LNA","LP CMOS process","asymmetrical T-coils","gate inductive peaking","layout design","chip area reduction","monolithic integrated circuit","millimeterwave CMOS amplifiers","frequency 24 GHz to 48 GHz","current 17.6 mA","voltage 1.2 V"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a 24-48-GHz low power high gain low noise amplifier (LNA) in a 90-nm LP CMOS process.

In order to enhance gain tunability, three gain-adjustment stages, i.e. cascode amplifier with active inductor as variable load, common-gate amplifier and source follower with variable current mirror were simultaneously employed to vary and control gain.

The existing models are, however, based on application of the sensing matrix acquired by exact observation functions. As a result, the corresponding reconstruction algorithms are much more time consuming than traditional matched filter (MF)-based focusing methods, especially in high resolution and wide swath systems. This paper presents a fast compressed sensing SAR imaging method using Omega-K algorithm for stepped frequency waveform. We formulate a new CS-SAR imaging model based on the use of the approximated stepped frequency SAR observation. We incorporate CS and Omega-K algorithm within a sparse regularization framework and then solve it by the iterative thresholding algorithm. The proposed method, named CS-Omega-K, can be applied to high-quality and high-resolution imaging under sub-Nyquist rate sampling, while decreasing the computational cost substantially both in memory and time, resulting in a fast approach. Finally, simulations show that the proposed method can perform stepped frequency SAR imaging effectively below Nyquist sampling rate.","doi":"10.1109/ICMMT.2016.7761827","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE International Conference on Microwave and Millimeter Wave Technology (ICMMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750913/7761650/07761827.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMMT.2016.7761827","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7761650","startPage":"521","endPage":"523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast compressed sensing SAR imaging using stepped frequency waveform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7761827","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast compressed sensing SAR imaging using stepped frequency waveform","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 June 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7761827/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 June 2016","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"16505710","dateOfInsertion":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7761827/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast compressed sensing SAR imaging using stepped frequency waveform","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"TA2C_02_68_4_0.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050326S","chronDate":"5-8 June 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750913","isNumber":"7761650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750913","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7761650","articleId":"7761827","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7762033,"authors":[{"name":"Anas Chaaban","affiliation":["Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Anas","lastName":"Chaaban","orcid":"0000-0002-8713-5084","id":"37395687700"},{"name":"Zouheir Rezki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Idaho, Moscow, ID, USA","Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Zouheir","lastName":"Rezki","id":"37294101200"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Division of Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7762033","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":380},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Resource management","Radio frequency","Wireless communication","MIMO","Channel capacity","Computers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplitude shift keying","intensity modulation","optical communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-SNR capacity","parallel IM-DD optical wireless channel","parallel intensity-modulation","direct-detection optical wireless channel","per-channel peak intensity constraint","optimal intensity allocation","signal-to-noise ratio","capacity-achieving on-off keying distribution","optical intensity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parallel IM-DD channels","capacity","intensity allocation","intensity per bit"]}],"abstract":"The capacity of parallel intensity-modulation and direct-detection optical wireless channels with total average intensity and per-channel peak intensity constraints is studied.

Interestingly, while activating the strongest channel is optimal if 1) the peak intensity is fixed, this is not the case if 2) the peak intensity is proportional to the average intensity. The minimum average optical intensity per bit is also studied, and is characterized for case 1) where it is achievable at low SNR.

Aggressive voltage scaling techniques have the potential to reduce the power consumption within the admitted envelope, but memory operations on standard six-transistor static RAM (6T-SRAM) cells become unreliable at low voltages. While standard cell memory (SCM) overcomes this limitation, it has much lower area density than SRAM, and thus it is too costly. On the other hand, several applications have inherent tolerance to computation errors, and executing such workloads with approximation has already proven a viable way to reduce energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel HW/SW approach to design energy-efficient ultralow-power systems which combine the key ideas of approximate computing and hybrid memory systems featuring both SCM and 6T-SRAM. We introduce a novel hardware support to split error-tolerant data so to host most significant bits in the SCM and least significant bits (LSBs) in the 6T-SRAM. This allows to power the memory system at a low voltage while ensuring correct operation by binding possible (flip-bit) errors to the LSBs only. In addition, by organizing 6T-SRAM banks into multiple and independent voltage domains we enable fine-grained, software-controlled voltage switching policies. At the software level, we propose language constructs to specify what regions of code and what variables are tolerant to approximation, plus compiler support to optimize data placement. Experimental results show that our proposal can reduce the energy consumption of the memory system by 47% on average, always complying with the result accuracy required by practical applications constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2016.2633474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/8341525/07762037.pdf","startPage":"982","endPage":"995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2016.2633474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8341525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synergistic HW/SW Approximation Techniques for Ultralow-Power Parallel Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762037/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2018","displayDocTitle":"Synergistic HW/SW Approximation Techniques for Ultralow-Power Parallel Computing","volume":"37","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2018","accessionNumber":"17716101","htmlLink":"/document/7762037/","dateOfInsertion":"19 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European FP7 ERC Advanced Project MULTITHERMAN","grantNumber":"291125"},{"fundingName":"IcySoC and YINS RTD Projects through the Swiss NSF and Nano-Tera.ch with Swiss Confederation Financing"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synergistic HW/SW Approximation Techniques for Ultralow-Power Parallel Computing","sourcePdf":"tcad-tagliavini-2633474-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096139S","chronDate":"May  2018","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"8341525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"8341525","articleId":"7762037","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762041,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Di Palma","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France","CEA LETI, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble, France","Space Engineering S.p.A.

The 2-D electronic beam-steering capabilities of \u00b160\u00b0 have been verified experimentally.

The axial ratio remains below 2 dB within this bandwidth. Next, a planar substrate integrated waveguide focal source array was designed in order to reduce the focal distance by about 50% and thereby significantly improve the antenna compactness, and similar radiation performance is demonstrated numerically and experimentally.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762041/","volume":"65","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7762041/","accessionNumber":"16639059","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Circularly-Polarized Reconfigurable Transmitarray in Ka-Band With Beam Scanning and Polarization Switching Capabilities","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"French Ministry of Defense (Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de l\u2019Armement)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circularly-Polarized Reconfigurable Transmitarray in Ka-Band With Beam Scanning and Polarization Switching Capabilities","sourcePdf":"tap-dipalma-2633067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109269S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7839250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"110","xplore-issue":"7839250","articleId":"7762041","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7762053,"authors":[{"name":"Jiangbin Lyu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Jiangbin","lastName":"Lyu","orcid":"0000-0001-5609-7647","id":"37073228500"},{"name":"Yong Zeng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Zeng","orcid":"0000-0002-3670-0434","id":"38000332700"},{"name":"Rui Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085461186"},{"name":"Teng Joon Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Teng Joon","lastName":"Lim","id":"37280114800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7762053","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":444,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":8021},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Partitioning algorithms","Spirals","Wireless communication","Clustering algorithms","Heuristic algorithms","Base stations","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous aerial vehicles","mobile communication","optimisation","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["placement optimization","unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted mobile base stations","UAV-mounted mobile base stations","terrestrial communication networks","wireless connectivity","distributed ground terminals","polynomial-time algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Unmanned aerial vehicles","mobile base station placement","user coverage","geometric disk cover problem"]}],"abstract":"In terrestrial communication networks without fixed infrastructure, unmanned aerial vehicle-mounted mobile base stations (MBSs) provide an efficient solution to achieve wireless connectivity.

The multilooked POLSAR data in the format of coherency or covariance matrix is first converted into a normalized 6-D real feature vector. The six-channel real image is then fed into a four-layer convolutional neural network tailored for POLSAR classification. With two cascaded convolutional layers, the designed deep neural network can automatically learn hierarchical polarimetric spatial features from the data. Two experiments are presented using the AIRSAR data of San Francisco, CA, and Flevoland, The Netherlands. Classification result of the San Francisco case shows that slant built-up areas, which are conventionally mixed with vegetated area in polarimetric feature space, can now be successfully distinguished after taking into account spatial features. Quantitative analysis with respect to ground truth information available for the Flevoland test site shows that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.46% in classifying the considered 15 classes.

Three types of CNN implementations are investigated using analog, digital, and spintronic circuits. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to quantify the impact of the input noise, thermal noise, and the number of bits representing the weights of synapses on the overall recall probability and delay. The results demonstrate that the recall probability improves significantly as the number of synapses increase. Using a 4-b resolution for synapse weights provides the best tradeoff between the required numbers of synapses and synapse bits for a target recall rate. Finally, three types of CNN implementations with various device technologies are benchmarked for a given input noise and recall accuracy target. It is shown that spintronic devices are promising candidates to implement CNNs, where up to 3\u00d7 energy-delay product improvement is predicted in domain wall devices compared to its conventional CMOS counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/JXCDC.2016.2633251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7747664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JXCDC.2016.2633251","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Exploratory Solid-State Computational Devices and Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Exploratory Solid-State Computational Devices and Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570653/7747664/07762057.pdf","startPage":"36","endPage":"43","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Boolean Computing Benchmarking for Beyond-CMOS Devices Based on Cellular Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Non-Boolean Computing Benchmarking for Beyond-CMOS Devices Based on Cellular Neural Network","volume":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762057/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16606866","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762057/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000028","fundingName":"Semiconductor Research Corporation NRI Theme","grantNumber":"2624.001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Non-Boolean Computing Benchmarking for Beyond-CMOS Devices Based on Cellular Neural Network","sourcePdf":"jxcdc-pan-2633251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096454S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6570653","isNumber":"7747664","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570653","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7747664","articleId":"7762057","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762059,"authors":[{"name":"Zhijie Huang","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhijie","lastName":"Huang","id":"37086097623"},{"name":"Zhenzhen Gao","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Zhenzhen","lastName":"Gao","orcid":"0000-0002-6733-2523","id":"37714225800"},{"name":"Li Sun","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Sun","id":"38489339400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7762059","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":855},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762059","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Modulation","Receivers","Interference","Wireless communication","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interference","modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anti eavesdropping scheme","quadrature spatial modulation","secure quadrature spatial modulation scheme","artificial noise","random interference","multiple-input-single-output systems","QSM scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Quadrature spatial modulation","physical layer security","artificial noise","secrecy rate"]}],"abstract":"To resist the passive eavesdropping while reserving the same hardware cost and receiver structure of the legitimate receiver, a secure quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) scheme is proposed in this letter.

Using beam shaping technique, we achieve a 14-fold enhancement in the phase tuning resolution of the method with a Gaussian-shaped beam compared to a top-hat beam. The large improvement in the tuning resolution makes the femtosecond laser method potentially useful for very fine phase trimming of silicon photonic circuits.

Since it is intractable to obtain the globally optimum assignment policy for existing techniques due to the huge computation and communication overheads in ultra-dense scenario, in this paper, we propose a hierarchical resource allocation framework to achieve a desirable solution. Specifically, the solution is obtained by dividing the original optimization problem into four stages in partially distributed manner. First, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy by invoking clustering technique to decompose the dense network into smaller disjoint clusters. Then, within each cluster, one of the small cell access points is elected as a cluster head to carry out intra-cluster subchannel allocation with a low-complexity algorithm. To tackle the issue of inter-cluster interference, we further develop a distributed learning-base coordination mechanism.

The wearable system is composed of a microcontroller, a triaxial accelerometer, a triaxial gyroscope, and an RF wireless transmission module. The spatiotemporal gait analysis algorithm, consisting of procedures of inertial signal acquisition, signal preprocessing, gait phase detection, and ankle range of motion estimation, has been developed for extracting gait features from accelerations and angular velocities. In order to estimate accurate ankle range of motion, we have integrated accelerations and angular velocities into a complementary filter for reducing the accumulation of integration error of inertial signals. All 24 participants mounted the system on their foot to walk along a straight line of 10 m at normal speed and their walking recordings were collected to validate the effectiveness of the proposed system and algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed inertial measurement system with the designed spatiotemporal gait analysis algorithm is a promising tool for automatically analyzing spatiotemporal gait information, serving as clinical indicators for monitoring therapeutic efficacy for diagnosis of stroke or Parkinson's disease.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged

Due to the location dispersion of D2D pairs and short-distance D2D transmission, it should be preferred that multiple D2D pairs can simultaneously share the resource with cellular users (CUs). To address the nonconvexity of the EE maximization problem, we divide the original problem into two subproblems and propose an iterative algorithm with low complexity to solve it. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly and the EE of D2D links can be significantly improved compared with existing methods especially for an increasing number of

The proposed approach provides an intuitive way to collect data and exhibits the following characteristics: task performing capability, task reiteration ability, generalizability, and easy applicability. The proposed approach utilizes a real-time user interface with a monitor and provides a first-person perspective using a head-mounted display. Through this interface, teleoperation is used for collecting task operating data, especially for tasks that are difficult to be applied with a conventional method. A two-phase deep learning model is also utilized in the proposed approach. A deep convolutional autoencoder extracts images features and reconstructs images, and a fully connected deep time delay neural network learns the dynamics of a robot task process from the extracted image features and motion angle signals. The \u201cNextage Open\u201d humanoid robot is used as an experimental platform to evaluate the proposed model. The object folding task utilizing with 35 trained and 5 untrained sensory motor sequences for test. Testing the trained model with online generation demonstrates a 77.8% success rate for the object folding task.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762066/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"16561031","volume":"2","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7762066/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Repeatable Folding Task by Humanoid Robot Worker Using Deep Learning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005305","fundingName":"AIST"},{"fundingName":"Research Institute for Science and Engineering, Waseda University"},{"fundingName":"MEXT Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research","grantNumber":"15H01710"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Repeatable Folding Task by Humanoid Robot Worker Using Deep Learning","sourcePdf":"lra-yang-2633383-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100032S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"7797562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"7797562","articleId":"7762066","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":7762069,"authors":[{"name":"Jiseon Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jiseon","lastName":"Lee","orcid":"0000-0002-6399-0115","id":"38240985600"},{"name":"Cheeha Kim","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"firstName":"Cheeha","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0003-4955-1674","id":"37085648188"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7762069","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":699},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762069","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless LAN","OFDM","Schedules","Timing","Uplink","Data communication","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","telecommunication channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA WLAN","hybrid multiple access coordination scheme","channel utilization","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access wireless local area network","centralized access control","distributed random access"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple access coordination","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","channel utilization"]}],"abstract":"A new hybrid multiple access coordination scheme (HMAC) that increases channel utilization for orthogonal frequency-division multiple access wireless local area network is presented.

A compensation solenoid method was employed to design the coil configuration for the magnet. In order to manage the mechanical stress, we sectioned the long solenoid into six windings, and they were wound on five aluminum alloy mandrels. Four compensation coils were wound outside of the long solenoid windings to compensate the field inhomogeneity of imaging region. Preliminary analysis used by a simplified method has been conducted to estimate the stress levels and coil deformations. Furthermore, a finite-element method (FEM) was used to obtain the stress distribution of the magnet structure fully. The electromagnetic stresses, the sliding behavior, and the quench dynamic stresses were simulated by these FEM models. The cumulative stresses caused by winding pretension and thermal contractions were used as initial stresses to calculate the frictional stresses for the interface contact analysis. The quench-induced stresses and deformations of thermal shields are also discussed. The results are exploited to conduct mechanical design and construction of the magnet.","doi":"10.1109/TASC.2016.2632899","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel7/77/7753093/07762070.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASC.2016.2632899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7753093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical Analysis of Mechanical Behavior for a 9.4-T Whole-Body MRI Magnet","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762070","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762070/","displayDocTitle":"Numerical Analysis of Mechanical Behavior for a 9.4-T Whole-Body MRI Magnet","volume":"27","issue":"4","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16680216","externalId":"4400505","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762070/","dateOfInsertion":"20 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Instrument Developing Project of China","grantNumber":"ZDYZ010-2"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51407176 and 51307163"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical Analysis of Mechanical Behavior for a 9.4-T Whole-Body MRI Magnet","sourcePdf":"tasc-wang-2632899-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055246S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"77","isNumber":"7753093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7753093","articleId":"7762070","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762074,"authors":[{"name":"Xican Chen","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7887772/7762074/chen-2623763-small.gif","p":["Xican Chen received the B.S. degree in microelectronics and the Ph.D. degree in electronics science and technology from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2010 and 2016, respectively.","In 2016, he joins Spreadtrum Communications, Beijing, and has been working for frequency synthesizer in mobile applications.

In order to enhance the received signal power at legitimate receivers and impair the received signal quality at eavesdroppers simultaneously, multiple-antenna techniques have been proposed for physical layer security to improve secrecy performance via exploiting spatial degrees of freedom.

However, this kind of single-line-based method does not always work well due to at least two issues. One is the incoherence caused by the signal noise or the texture of other objects, where this texture deviates from the inherent texture of the current block. The other reason is that the nearest reference line usually has worse reconstruction quality in block-based video coding. Due to these two issues, this paper proposes an efficient multiple-line-based intra-prediction scheme to improve coding efficiency. Besides the nearest reference line, further reference lines are also utilized. The further reference lines with a relatively higher quality can provide potentially better prediction. At the same time, the residue compensation is introduced to calibrate the prediction of boundary regions in a block when we utilize further reference lines. To speed up the encoding process, this paper designs several fast algorithms. The experimental results show that compared with HM-16.9, the proposed fast search method achieves a 2.0% bit saving on average and up to 3.7% by increasing the encoding time by 112%.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2633377","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/8330723/07762080.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2016.2633377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8330723","startPage":"947","endPage":"957","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Multiple-Line-Based Intra Prediction for HEVC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762080","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Multiple-Line-Based Intra Prediction for HEVC","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762080/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17669905","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7762080/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB351800"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61370114 and 61425026"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004826","fundingName":"Beijing Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"4172027"},{"fundingName":"Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Multiple-Line-Based Intra Prediction for HEVC","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-xiong-2633377-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105606S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"8330723","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"8330723","articleId":"7762080","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762081,"authors":[{"name":"Olayinka O.

The joint channel estimation and decoding receiver is based on the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimation technique and the recently proposed RS parity-check transformation algorithm (PTA). A key feature of this joint receiver is the simple symbol remapping process used to refine the initial LMMSE estimate of the channel after each iterative RS-PTA decoding. The performance of the joint iterative receiver is compiled through computer simulation assuming a rectangular M-ary quadrature amplitude modulation as the underlying modulation scheme. Simulation results show significant symbol error rate (SER) improvement in the iterative receiver in comparison with the receiver without iterative feedback. Besides, the RS-PTA iterative receiver outperforms the recently proposed RS Koetter and Vardy (RS-KV) iterative receiver structure both in terms of the SER performance and the computational time complexity.

In the proposed double-resolution ADCs scheme, the total M antennas at relay are divided into two parts, one of which includes M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">0</sub>\n antennas with medium-resolution ADCs only requiring 5~12 quantization bits and the remainder of which consists of M\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n antennas with low-resolution ADCs. The transmission from relay to destinations is exposed to a passive eavesdropper. For such massive MIMO relaying systems, we first derive the total achievable ergodic rates of legitimate users as well as the corresponding secrecy outage rates. Then, a reasonable energy consumption model is modeled so that the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) is derived, where the effect of the source power, the resolutions of ADCs, and the ratio of the antenna numbers with medium- and low-resolution ADCs are exploited perfectly. The presented numerical results show that replacing high-resolution ADCs with medium-resolution ADCs is beneficial for improving the system SEE while the effect on the total achievable rate is very small.

The antenna is composed of single-layered meander SP cells and coplanar waveguide to SP structure converters. The periodically arranged SP cells of the SL-LWA generate a radiating space harmonic with forward, backward, and broadside radiation against frequency change. The study and experimental validation show that the proposed SL-LWA provides the consistent gain variation less than 2.5 dB of scanning beams within the 10-dB reflection bandwidth of 10.4-24.5 GHz (or 80%). In addition, the proposed antenna offers the wideband broadside radiation with 1-dB gain variation within the frequency range of 16.5-17.2 GHz (or 4.2%).

However, for most kernel methods, one must still choose a kernel to use for the problem. Since there is, in general, no way of knowing which kernel is the best, multiple kernel learning (MKL) is a technique used to learn the aggregation of a set of valid kernels into a single (ideally) superior kernel. The aggregation can be done using weighted sums of the precomputed kernels, but determining the summation weights is not a trivial task. Furthermore, MKL does not work well with large datasets because of limited storage space and prediction speed. In this paper, we address all three of these multiple kernel challenges. First, we introduce a new linear feature level fusion technique and learning algorithm, GAMKLp. Second, we put forth three new algorithms, DeFIMKL, DeGAMKL, and DeLSMKL, for nonlinear fusion of kernels at the decision level. To address MKL's storage and speed drawbacks, we apply the Nystrom approximation to the kernel matrices. We compare our methods to a successful and state-of-the-art technique called MKL-group lasso (MKLGL), and experiments on several benchmark datasets show that some of our proposed algorithms outperform MKLGL when applied to support vector machine (SVM)-based classification. However, to no surprise, there does not seem to be a global winner but instead different strategies that a user can employ. Experiments with our kernel approximation method show that we can routinely discard most of the training data and at least double prediction speed without sacrificing classification accuracy. These results suggest that MKL-based classification techniques can be applied to big data efficiently, which is confirmed by an experiment using a large dataset.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2633372","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8124149/07762088.pdf","startPage":"1403","endPage":"1416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8124149","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2633372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Multiple Kernel Classification Using Feature and Decision Level Fusion","volume":"25","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7762088/","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17394544","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762088/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"U.S. Army TACOM Life Cycle Command","grantNumber":"W56HZV-08-C-0236"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-16-1-0241 and W911NF-16-1-0017"},{"fundingName":"U.S.\u00a0Army RDECOM CERDEC NVESD"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-14-1-0114, 57940-EV and W911NF-14-1-0673"},{"fundingName":"U.S. Army RDECOM CERDEC NVESD"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Multiple Kernel Classification Using Feature and Decision Level Fusion","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-pinar-2633372-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125954S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8124149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"8124149","articleId":"7762088","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-25"},{"_id":7762092,"authors":[{"name":"Samarth Saxena","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Samarth","lastName":"Saxena","id":"37085862374"},{"name":"Karun Rawat","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communication, Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"firstName":"Karun","lastName":"Rawat","orcid":"0000-0002-9395-342X","id":"38553807400"},{"name":"Patrick Roblin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA"],"firstName":"Patrick","lastName":"Roblin","id":"37299531300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7762092","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":50,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1142},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762092","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Harmonic analysis","Bandwidth","Impedance","Gallium nitride","HEMTs","Power amplifiers","Space exploration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high electron mobility transistors","UHF power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband class-B-J continuous mode","power amplifier","current-source reference plane","intrinsic impedances","package reference plane","model-based nonlinear-embedding technique","extrinsic harmonic impedance","Smith chart","Foster circuit","general class-B-J voltage equation","clockwise trajectory","package plane","gallium nitride high electron mobility transistor","power 15 W","frequency 1.3 GHz to 2.4 GHz","efficiency 63 percent to 72 percent"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadband","class-J","continuous mode","embedding","Foster","gallium nitride (GaN)","high electron mobility transistor (HEMT)","power amplifier (PA)"]}],"abstract":"This brief explores the design space for realizable solution of a broadband class-B/J continuous mode of power amplifier (PA).

In order to validate the advantage of this analysis, the PA is implemented using a 15 W gallium nitride high electron mobility transistor in the frequency range of 1.3 to 2.4 GHz and drain efficiency between 63% and 72% in measurement was achieved over the entire bandwidth.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2633300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7956382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2633300","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7956382/07762092.pdf","startPage":"837","endPage":"841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Continuous Class-B/J Power Amplifier Using a Nonlinear Embedding Technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Continuous Class-B/J Power Amplifier Using a Nonlinear Embedding Technique","volume":"64","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 June 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762092/","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969633","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762092/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DST, SERB","grantNumber":"SB/S3/EECE/047/2014"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Continuous Class-B/J Power Amplifier Using a Nonlinear Embedding Technique","sourcePdf":"tcsii-rawat-2633300-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046501S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7956382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7956382","articleId":"7762092","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762095,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Yassin","affiliation":["ECE Department, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7936707/7762095/yassi-2632427-small.gif","p":["Ali Yassin received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from the American University of Beirut (AUB), Lebanon, in 2012 and 2014, respectively, where he received the Ph.D. degree with the major area of his study is communication systems and the minor area is networking and security under the thesis titled Context Inference, Localization and Mapping in Indoor Environments Using MMWaves in Fall 2015.

In this paper, we survey different technologies and methodologies for indoor and outdoor localization with an emphasis on indoor methodologies and concepts. Additionally, we discuss in this review different localization-based applications, where the location information is critical to estimate.

We introduce quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC LDPC) lattices as a special case of LDPC lattices with one binary QC-LDPC code as their underlying code. These lattices are obtained from the Construction A of lattices providing us to encode them efficiently using shift registers. To benefit from an encoder with linear complexity in the lattice dimension, we obtain the generator matrix of these lattices in quasi-cyclic form. We generalize the proposed quasi-cyclic form of the generator matrix for other Construction A lattices, namely the LDA lattices, with a non-binary QC-LDPC code as their underlying code. We provide a low-complexity decoding algorithm of QC LDPC-lattices based on the sum product algorithm. To design lattice codes, QC LDPC-lattices are combined with the nested lattice shaping that uses the Voronoi region of a sublattice for shaping. The shaping gain and the shaping loss of our lattice codes with dimensions 40, 50, and 60 using an optimal quantizer, are presented. The guidelines for applying efficient shaping methods, like hypercube shaping, for QC LDPC-lattices are also given. Consequently, we establish a family of lattice codes that perform practically close to the sphere bound.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2633343","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2633343","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07762096.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"500","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Encoder and Decoder for Power Constrained QC LDPC-Lattice Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Practical Encoder and Decoder for Power Constrained QC LDPC-Lattice Codes","volume":"65","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762096/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16669130","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762096/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Encoder and Decoder for Power Constrained QC LDPC-Lattice Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-sadeghi-2633343-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12493S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7762096","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762100,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Sun","affiliation":["Beijing Engineering and Technology Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services, School of Computer and Communication Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7762100/sun-2631243-small.gif","p":["Jian Sun received the B.S. and M.S. degree in engineering from Northeast Petroleum University in 2004 and 2011, respectively.

However, the severe interference imposed on the conventional cellular users (CUs) by the geographically close-by D2D pairs may cause a significant performance erosion in the D2D-aided underlaying cellular networks (CNs). In this paper, performance analysis for the D2D-aided underlaying CNs in terms of throughput is provided. We first derive the closed-form expressions of the coverage probability for both the conventional cellular links and the D2D links, followed by giving out the approximated expressions of the ergodic data rate for both an individual cellular/D2D link and the whole underlaying network. Furthermore, the key parameters (e.g., the density of D2D users (DUs) or CUs, and the average geographical distance between a pair of D2D peers) significantly impacting the channel capacity are adaptively adjusted for maximizing the sum data rate of the proposed underlaying networks. In addition, both theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal the attainability of the maximal throughput by optimizing the critical parameters, such as the density of DUs, provided that the scale factor between the DUs and sum users (i.e., comprising both conventional CUs and DUs) can be effectively balanced subject to the constraints specified in the proposed scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2631243","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","startPage":"8844","endPage":"8856","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07762100.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Mode Selection With Uplink Data Rate Maximization for D2D-Aided Underlaying Cellular Networks","topic":"Resource Management in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks: Energy Management, Communication Protocol and Future Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762100/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762100/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Optimal Mode Selection With Uplink Data Rate Maximization for D2D-Aided Underlaying Cellular Networks","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16588005","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61431001"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2017D02"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005372","fundingName":"Key Laboratory of Cognitive Radio and Information Processing, Ministry of Education, Guilin University of Electronic Technology"},{"fundingName":"Foundation of Beijing Engineering and Technology Center for Convergence Networks and Ubiquitous Services"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Optimal Mode Selection With Uplink Data Rate Maximization for D2D-Aided Underlaying Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"access-sun-2631243-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09233S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Resource Management in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks: Energy Management, Communication Protocol and Future Applications"],"articleId":"7762100","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7762104,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Cheng","affiliation":["School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","Department of Electrical Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, South Korea","School of Science, Hubei University for Nationalities, Enshi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8278217/7762104/cheng-2633325-small.gif","p":["Jun Cheng received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied\n mathematics from Hubei University for Nationalities, Enshi, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in instrumentation\n science and technology from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, in 2015.","He is currently with the School of Science, Hubei University for Nationalities, and also a Postdoctoral Researcher\n with the School Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

in the IEEE 802.11 power saving mode (PSM), have been widely used in wireless ad hoc networks. The time required to complete the synchronization progress, i.e., synchronization efficiency, is obviously an important performance metrics for CDS protocols. However, few attempts have been focusing on modeling and analyzing the synchronization efficiency of the CDS protocols. In this letter, we present a 2-D Markov chain model for the CDS scheme of the IEEE 802.11 PSM. The purpose of our model is to determine the relationship between the time required to complete the synchronization process and the value of the contention parameter, i.e., the contention window size. Through modeling, we derive the optimal values of the contention window size to achieve the minimum synchronization time at different network scales.

The Third Generation Partnership Project has launched the corresponding standards for multiple heterogeneous wireless smart devices in the long term evolution (LTE)/LTE-advanced. In the forthcoming years, the valuable information hidden in the deluge of data will be extracted and utilized in every field to improve quality and efficiency. However, the bottleneck of realizing this magnificent vista of future intelligent lives lies in how to satisfy the practical demands to transmit huge data volume through efficient wireless communication in diverse scenarios. Herein, multi-scenario wireless communication triggers critical problems in wireless channel modeling and soundings for 5G IoT, which by far, are understudied. In this paper, we introduce a general wireless channel model and its multiple up-to-date corresponding channel sounding methods for future 5G IoT green wireless communication. Through adopting the perspective of wireless big data excavation, the smart channel sounder transforms the traditional passive wireless communication scheme into an active expectation-guaranteed wireless communication scheme, which helps achieve efficient and green communication. To demonstrate the validity and efficiency of this smart sounder scheme, we make a compatible prototype testified in multiple scenarios. The multiple real-scenario experiments demonstrate that the smart sounder can function effectively, especially in those scenarios where traditional channel state information is not available or imperfect.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["5G mobile comunication","Big data","Green communication","Internet of Things","Wireless communication","Smart devices","Channel state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","Internet of Things","Long Term Evolution","telecommunication power management","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet-of-Things","machine type communication","Third Generation Partnership Project","multiple heterogeneous wireless smart devices","long term evolution","LTE-advanced","multi-scenario wireless communication","wireless channel modeling","5G IoT green wireless communication","wireless big data excavation","smart channel sounder","passive wireless communication scheme","expectation-guaranteed wireless communication scheme","channel state information"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G IoT","channel sounding","wireless big data","active estimation","green communication"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762116","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2628820","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07762116.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2628820","startPage":"8888","endPage":"8899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart Channel Sounder for 5G IoT: From Wireless Big Data to Active Communication","topic":"Green Communications and Networking for 5G Wireless","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Smart Channel Sounder for 5G IoT: From Wireless Big Data to Active Communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762116/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7762116/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16587984","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"State Key Development Program of Basic Research of China","grantNumber":"2012CB316100(2)"},{"fundingName":"European Union Project CoNHealth","grantNumber":"294923"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Smart Channel Sounder for 5G IoT: From Wireless Big Data to Active Communication","sourcePdf":"access-fan-2628820-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092349S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Green Communications and Networking for 5G Wireless"],"articleId":"7762116","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762118,"authors":[{"name":"Debdeep Sarkar","affiliation":["IIT Kanpur, Kanpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7839250/7762118/sarka-2633158-small.gif","p":["Debdeep Sarkar (S\u201913) was born in Burdwan, India, in 1989.

Both frequency-domain (FD) and time-domain (TD) postprocessing techniques are proposed for possible application with this FDTD-CGF scheme. The FDTD-CGF-TD scheme utilizes TD signal-processing methods and exhibits significant reduction in ECC computation time as compared with the FDTD-CGF-FD scheme, for high-frequency resolution requirements. The proposed FDTD-CGF-based schemes can be applied for accurate and fast prediction of wideband ECC response, instead of the conventional scattering parameter-based techniques which have several limitations. Numerical examples of the proposed FDTD-CGF techniques are provided for two-element MIMO systems involving thin-wire half-wavelength dipoles in parallel side-by-side as well as orthogonal arrangements. Furthermore, examples of two-element MIMO systems involving multiband LC resonator loaded dipoles and pattern-diversity antennas using parasitic elements are also included. The results obtained from the FDTD-CGF techniques are compared with results from commercial electromagnetic solver Ansys HFSS, to verify the validity of proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2633158","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7839250/07762118.pdf","startPage":"730","endPage":"740","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2633158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839250","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Cross-Correlation Greens Function Along With FDTD for Fast Computation of Envelope Correlation Coefficient Over Wideband for MIMO Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762118","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762118/","displayDocTitle":"Application of Cross-Correlation Greens Function Along With FDTD for Fast Computation of Envelope Correlation Coefficient Over Wideband for MIMO Antennas","volume":"65","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16639029","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762118/","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001843","fundingName":"Science and Engineering Research Board","grantNumber":"SB/S3/EECE/0164/2015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Cross-Correlation Greens Function Along With FDTD for Fast Computation of Envelope Correlation Coefficient Over Wideband for MIMO Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-sarkar-2633158-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098015S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7839250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7839250","articleId":"7762118","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762121,"authors":[{"name":"Najeeb Ul Hassan","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, SFB 912 HAEC, Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7855844/7762121/hassa-2633466-small.gif","p":["Najeeb Ul Hassan (M\u201912) received the B.S. degree from the National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan, in 2007, the M.Sc. degree in digital communications from the Christian-Albrechts-University of Kiel, Germany, in 2010, and the Dr. Ing. degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Dresden, Germany.

However, considering practical constraints on decoding latency and complexity, a sliding window decoding approach is normally preferred. In order to reduce decoding complexity compared with standard parallel decoding schedules, serial schedules can be applied within a decoding window. However, uniform serial schedules within a window do not provide the expected reduction in complexity. Hence, we propose non-uniform schedules (parallel and serial) based on measured improvements in the estimated bit error rate (BER). We show that these non-uniform schedules result in a significant reduction in complexity without any loss in performance. Furthermore, based on observations made using density evolution, we propose a non-uniform pragmatic decoding schedule (parallel and serial) that does not require any additional calculations (e.g., BER estimates) within the decoding process.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2633466","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07762121.pdf","startPage":"501","endPage":"510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2633466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Uniform Window Decoding Schedules for Spatially Coupled LDPC Codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762121","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/7855844/7762121-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Non-Uniform Window Decoding Schedules for Spatially Coupled LDPC Codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762121/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16669140","htmlLink":"/document/7762121/","volume":"65","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Research Foundation (DFG) within the Collaborative Research Center SFB 912 HAEC"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004895","fundingName":"European Social Fund in the framework of the Young Investigators Group 3DCSI, T\u00dcB\u0130TAK","grantNumber":"111E276"},{"fundingName":"EU FP7 Marie Curie IRG","grantNumber":"268264"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1165714"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Non-Uniform Window Decoding Schedules for Spatially Coupled LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tcomm-ulhassan-2633466-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095358S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7762121","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762122,"authors":[{"name":"Byung Chang Chung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Byung Chang","lastName":"Chung","orcid":"0000-0002-5543-6157","id":"38540818500"},{"name":"Dong-Ho Cho","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Ho","lastName":"Cho","orcid":"0000-0001-9849-4392","id":"37085406506"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7762122","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1046},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Macrocell networks","IEEE 802.11 Standard","Interference","Throughput","Long Term Evolution","Economics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["game theory","Long Term Evolution","radiofrequency interference","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile data offloading","almost blank subframe","LTE-LAA","Wi-Fi coexisting networks","coalition game","long-term evolution-licensed-assisted access","time-resource utility model","min-max","Shapley fairness"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless LAN (WLAN, Wi-Fi)","long-term evolution (LTE)","licensed-assisted access (LAA)","coexistence","offloading","almost blank subframe (ABS)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762122","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07762122.pdf","startPage":"608","endPage":"611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2633341","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2633341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobile Data Offloading With Almost Blank Subframe in LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi Coexisting Networks Based on Coalition Game","abstract":"The problem of spectrum scarcity has raised the prospect of coexisting network. For example, long-term evolution-licensed-assisted access (LTE-LAA & Wi-Fi) can operate in the same frequency band. However, interference between the two different radio access technologies can severely reduce the performances of both networks. To mitigate this interference, the concept of an almost blank subframe (ABS) has been proposed. However, because the LTE-LAA macrocell must remain silent, this provides no incentive for its throughput enhancement. In this letter, we propose a transaction between LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi using ABS together with offloading. We model a time-resource utility model by jointly considering the resource consumed for ABS and offloading, and then formulate a coalition game. To achieve the solution of a coalition game, we consider two fairness concepts: min-max and Shapley fairness. We then verify the performance of the proposed game using simulations. It is shown that the proposed game model can improve resource utilization through the joint use of ABS and offloading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762122/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"21","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16723209","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762122/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Mobile Data Offloading With Almost Blank Subframe in LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi Coexisting Networks Based on Coalition Game","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ICT R&D program of MSIP/IITP [B0101-16-1369, Development of small basestation supporting multiple streams based on LTE-A systems]"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobile Data Offloading With Almost Blank Subframe in LTE-LAA and Wi-Fi Coexisting Networks Based on Coalition Game","sourcePdf":"lcomm-cho-2633341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077646S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7874222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7874222","articleId":"7762122","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762123,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed Haddad Pajouh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Information Technology, Shiraz University of Technology, Moddares Blvd., Shiraz, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/8731794/7762123/pajou-2633228-small.gif","p":["HAMED HADDAD PAJOUH is working toward the PhD degree in information technology engineering (computer networks) at Shiraz University of Technology, Iran.

Transfer learning and domain adaptation have been extensively used for this purpose. However, most previous works focused on classification problems. This paper considers an important regression problem in BCI, namely, online driver drowsiness estimation from EEG signals. By integrating fuzzy sets with domain adaptation, we propose a novel online weighted adaptation regularization for regression (OwARR) algorithm to reduce the amount of subject-specific calibration data, and also a source domain selection (SDS) approach to save about half of the computational cost of OwARR. Using a simulated driving dataset with 15 subjects, we show that OwARR and OwARR-SDS can achieve significantly smaller estimation errors than several other approaches. We also provide comprehensive analyses on the robustness of OwARR and OwARR-SDS.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2633379","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8124149/07762132.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2633379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8124149","startPage":"1522","endPage":"1535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Driver Drowsiness Estimation From EEG Signals Using Online Weighted Adaptation Regularization for Regression (OwARR)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762132","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Driver Drowsiness Estimation From EEG Signals Using Online Weighted Adaptation Regularization for Regression (OwARR)","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762132/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"25","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","accessionNumber":"17394533","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762132/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006754","fundingName":"U.S. Army Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"W911NF-10-2-0022 and W911NF-10-D-0002/TO 0023"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council (ARC) under discovery","grantNumber":"DP150101645"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Driver Drowsiness Estimation From EEG Signals Using Online Weighted Adaptation Regularization for Regression (OwARR)","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-wu-2633379-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149332S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8124149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"8124149","articleId":"7762132","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762134,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Akbari","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Akbari","id":"37086099369"},{"name":"Mehdi Kamal","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Kamal","id":"37543656900"},{"name":"Ali Afzali-Kusha","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Afzali-Kusha","id":"38270948500"},{"name":"Massoud Pedram","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Massoud","lastName":"Pedram","id":"37278158100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7762134","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1732},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762134","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Delays","Power demand","Logic gates","Multiplexing","Error correction","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","carry logic","energy conservation","MOSFET circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximate operating modes","exact operating modes","RAP-CLA adder","error rate","FinFET technology","fast yet energy-efficient reconfigurable approximate carry look-ahead adder","size 15.0 nm","word length 32 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Approximate computing","carry look-ahead adder (CLA)","quality of service","reconfigurable"]}],"abstract":"In this brief, we propose a fast yet energy-efficient reconfigurable approximate carry look-ahead adder (RAP-CLA). This adder has the ability of switching between the approximate and exact operating modes making it suitable for both error-resilient and exact applications. The structure, which is more area and power efficient than state-of-the-art reconfigurable approximate adders, is achieved by some modifications to the conventional carry look ahead adder (CLA). The efficacy of the proposed RAP-CLA adder is evaluated by comparing its characteristics to those of two state-of-the-art reconfigurable approximate adders as well as the conventional (exact) CLA in a 15 nm FinFET technology. The results reveal that, in the approximate operating mode, the proposed 32-bit adder provides up to 55% and 28% delay and power reductions compared to those of the exact CLA, respectively, at the cost of up to 35.16% error rate. It also provides up to 49% and 19% lower delay and power consumption, respectively, compared to other approximate adders considered in this brief. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed adder on two image processing applications of smoothing and sharpening is demonstrated.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2633307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2633307","startPage":"1089","endPage":"1093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8423543/07762134.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8423543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAP-CLA: A Reconfigurable Approximate Carry Look-Ahead Adder","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"RAP-CLA: A Reconfigurable Approximate Carry Look-Ahead Adder","volume":"65","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 July 2018","accessionNumber":"17989832","publicationDate":"Aug. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7762134/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003968","fundingName":"Iran National Science Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RAP-CLA: A Reconfigurable Approximate Carry Look-Ahead Adder","sourcePdf":"tcsii-afzalikusha-2633307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078079S","chronDate":"Aug.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8423543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"8423543","articleId":"7762134","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762135,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Hu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Hu","orcid":"0000-0003-1711-4971","id":"37085810287"},{"name":"Hong Wen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Wen","id":"37286985000"},{"name":"Bin Wu","affiliation":["Tianjin Key Laboratory of Advanced Networking, School of Computer Science and Technology, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085497119"},{"name":"Jie Tang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085433168"},{"name":"Fei Pan","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Pan","id":"37085435398"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7762135","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1211},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762135","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Wireless networks","Array signal processing","Quality of service","Jamming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","jamming","optimisation","quality of service","telecommunication network reliability","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive transmission security","physical layer security","cooperative wireless network","cooperative transmission security","quality of service","outage constrained secrecy rate maximization","QoS constraint","transmit strategy adaptation","security protection","cooperative jamming scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical layer security","adaptive transmission","artificial noise","security protection","secrecy rate maximization"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the physical layer security in cooperative wireless networks where a source (Alice) transmits a confidential message to a destination (Bob) with the help of a cooperative node (Charlie), in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Cooperative transmission is explored to secure communication between Alice and Bob, while ensuring the desired quality of service (QoS) at Charlie's receiver. We provide a transmit design for outage constrained secrecy rate maximization, taking both security and QoS constraints into account. Unlike the conventional cooperative security that adopts a fixed transmission scheme, we propose a mechanism for transmit strategy adaptation with security protection. Specifically, the proposed cooperative transmission is replaced by a cooperative jamming scheme if either security or QoS constraint is not satisfied.

We analyze the performance of FA-CSA in terms of packet loss rate and delay. In particular, we derive the (approximate) density evolution that characterizes the asymptotic performance of FA-CSA when the frame length goes to infinity. We show that, if the receiver can monitor the system before anyone starts transmitting, a boundary effect similar to that of spatially coupled codes occurs, which greatly improves the iterative decoding threshold. Furthermore, we derive tight approximations of the error floor (EF) for the finite frame length regime, based on the probability of occurrence of the most frequent stopping sets. We show that, in general, FA-CSA provides better performance in both the EF and waterfall regions as compared to FS-CSA. Moreover, FA-CSA exhibits better delay properties than FS-CSA.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2633468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855844","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2633468","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7855844/07762138.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"704","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Frame Asynchronous Coded Slotted ALOHA: Asymptotic, Finite Length, and Delay Analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"On Frame Asynchronous Coded Slotted ALOHA: Asymptotic, Finite Length, and Delay Analysis","volume":"65","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762138/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16669136","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762138/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Vetenskapsr\u00e5det","grantNumber":"2011-5950 and 2011-5961"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Frame Asynchronous Coded Slotted ALOHA: Asymptotic, Finite Length, and Delay Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcomm-graelliamat-2633468-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087865S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7855844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7855844","articleId":"7762138","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762139,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew F.

Ultra-high throughput and ultra-low latency processing of source and channel coding are required by the emerging new video transmission applications, such as the first-person remote control of unmanned vehicles. The recently proposed unary error correction (UEC) code facilitates the joint source and channel coding (JSCC) of video information at transmission throughputs that approach the capacity of the wireless channel. In this paper, we propose the first hardware implementation of the UEC code that achieves the high processing throughputs as well as ultra-low processing latencies required. This is achieved by extending the application of the recently proposed fully parallel turbo decoder (FPTD) from pure stand-alone channel coding to JSCC. This paper also proposes several novel improvements to the FPTD, in order to increase its hardware efficiency and supported frame length. We demonstrate the application of these improvements to both the long term evolution turbo code and the UEC code. We synthesize the proposed fully parallel design on a mid-range field programmable gate array, achieving a throughput of 450 Mbps, as well as a factor of 2.4 hardware efficiency improvement over previous implementations of the FPTD.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Throughput FPGA Architecture for Joint Source and Channel Decoding","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2633441","startPage":"2921","endPage":"2944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2633441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07762139.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762139/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","displayDocTitle":"A High-Throughput FPGA Architecture for Joint Source and Channel Decoding","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7762139/","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16772335","isOpenAccess":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EPSRC, Swindon, U.K.","grantNumber":"EP/J015520/1 and EP/L010550/1"},{"fundingName":"TSB, Swindon, U.K.","grantNumber":"TS/L009390/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A High-Throughput FPGA Architecture for Joint Source and Channel Decoding","sourcePdf":"access-hanzo-2633441-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131315S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7859429","articleId":"7762139","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762141,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Shafique","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["Muhammad Shafique is a Full Professor at the Institute of Computer Engineering, Department of Informatics, Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien), Vienna, Austria.

Therefore, the presence of the neutral wire is inevitable. A four-leg inverter is a common solution to connect DGs to stand-alone loads as well as providing the neutral wire. In this paper, by considering a filter inductor in the fourth (neutral) leg of the four-leg inverter, a detailed model is presented, which illustrates a strong coupling among different phases. In order to remove this coupling effect, it is proposed to transform the quantities from the abc to the \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 reference frame. Furthermore, based on the proposed decoupled model, a new deadbeat control scheme is proposed to provide balanced sinusoidal voltages at the output of the inverter. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control techniques, experimental results on a 3-kW setup with the digital-signal-processor-based digital controller are provided under various loading conditions, such as linear/nonlinear, balanced/unbalanced, and single-/three-phase loads.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2016.2631459","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7874245/07762142.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2016.2631459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874245","startPage":"2592","endPage":"2601","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deadbeat Control of the Stand-Alone Four-Leg Inverter Considering the Effect of the Neutral Line Inductor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762142","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deadbeat Control of the Stand-Alone Four-Leg Inverter Considering the Effect of the Neutral Line Inductor","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762142/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16723162","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762142/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deadbeat Control of the Stand-Alone Four-Leg Inverter Considering the Effect of the Neutral Line Inductor","sourcePdf":"tie-rastegar-2631459-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081317S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7874245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"7874245","articleId":"7762142","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762146,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Liang","affiliation":["College of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China","Research School of Engineering, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7801970/7762146/liang-2616489-small.gif","p":["Jie Liang received the B.E. degree in automatic control from the National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China, in 2011.

While extensive studies have focused on developing methods to improve the classification accuracy, experimental setting and design for method evaluation have drawn little attention. In the scope of supervised classification, we find that traditional experimental designs for spectral processing are often improperly used in the spectral-spatial processing context, leading to unfair or biased performance evaluation. This is especially the case when training and testing samples are randomly drawn from the same image - a practice that has been commonly adopted in the experiments. Under such setting, the dependence caused by overlap between the training and testing samples may be artificially enhanced by some spatial information processing methods, such as spatial filtering and morphological operation. Such enhancement of dependence in return amplifies the classification accuracy, leading to an improper evaluation of spectral-spatial classification techniques. Therefore, the widely adopted pixel-based random sampling strategy is not always suitable to evaluate spectral-spatial classification algorithms, because it is difficult to determine whether the improvement of classification accuracy is caused by incorporating spatial information into classifier or by increasing the overlap between training and testing samples. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel controlled random sampling strategy for spectral-spatial methods. It can greatly reduce the overlap between training and testing samples and provides more objective and accurate evaluation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762146/","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16596840","volume":"55","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Sampling Strategy for Evaluation of Spectral-Spatial Methods in Hyperspectral Image Classification","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571393"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Sampling Strategy for Evaluation of Spectral-Spatial Methods in Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhou-2616489-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10403S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7801970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7801970","articleId":"7762146","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":7762147,"authors":[{"name":"Andson Balieiro","affiliation":["University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Andson","lastName":"Balieiro","orcid":"0000-0002-1827-665X","id":"37086109105"},{"name":"Marcos Falc\u00e3o","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Falc\u00e3o","orcid":"0000-0003-1104-639X","id":"37086114881"},{"name":"Kelvin Dias","affiliation":["Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil"],"firstName":"Kelvin","lastName":"Dias","id":"37868824500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7762147","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":395},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Substrates","Wireless sensor networks","Interference","Resource management","Load modeling","Exponential distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","optimisation","probability","queueing theory","radiofrequency interference","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secondary virtual network mapping","SVN mapping","cognitive radio","collision probability analysis","wireless virtualization mapping process","primary virtual networks","PVN","NP-hard problem","M/M/N/N queue"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","virtual wireless networks","collision probability","secondary virtual networks mapping"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a wireless virtualization mapping process based on cognitive radio (CR).

The nonlinear plant is described by a continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy-affine model with parametric uncertainties, and the sensor faults are characterized by a Markov process. Specifically, by applying a state-input augmentation technique, the original closed-loop system is first reformulated into a descriptor fuzzy-affine system. Based on a new piecewise-Markovian Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, combined with a Wirtinger-based integral inequality, improved reciprocally convex inequality, and S-procedure, a novel bounded real lemma is then derived for the underlying closed-loop system. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the redundancy of descriptor system formulation, together with a linearization procedure, the piecewiseaffine controller synthesis is carried out. It is shown that the desired piecewise-affine controller gains can be attained by solving a linear matrix inequality based optimization problem. Finally, simulation examples are performed to confirm the effectiveness and less conservatism of the presented approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762153/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2017","volume":"25","issue":"6","accessionNumber":"17394539","dateOfInsertion":"29 November 2017","publicationDate":"Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762153/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach to Reliable Output Feedback Control of Fuzzy-Affine Systems With Time Delays and Sensor Faults","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503091, 61522306 and 61374031"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016T90270 and 2015M570282"},{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province","grantNumber":"LBH-Z14056"},{"fundingName":"Harbin Special Funds for Technological Innovation Research","grantNumber":"2014RFQXJ067"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach to Reliable Output Feedback Control of Fuzzy-Affine Systems With Time Delays and Sensor Faults","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-wei-2633323-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103795S","chronDate":"Dec.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8124149","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"8124149","articleId":"7762153","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762164,"authors":[{"name":"Coralia Cartis","affiliation":["Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, U.K."],"bio":{"p":["Coralia Cartis received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Babesh-Bolyai University, Cluj, Romania, and the Certificate of Advanced Studies (Part III) and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from the University of Cambridge, where her Ph.D. adviser was Prof. M.

(2010), signals whose wavelet coefficients exhibit a rooted tree structure can be recovered using specially adapted compressed sensing algorithms from just n = O(k) measurements, where k is the sparsity of the signal. Motivated by these results, we introduce a simplified proportional-dimensional asymptotic framework, which enables the quantitative evaluation of recovery guarantees for tree-based compressed sensing. In the context of Gaussian matrices, we apply this framework to existing worst-case analysis of the iterative tree projection (ITP) algorithm, which makes use of the tree-based restricted isometry property (RIP). Within the same framework, we then obtain quantitative results based on a new method of analysis, which considers the fixed points of the algorithm. By exploiting the realistic average-case assumption that the measurements are statistically independent of the signal, we obtain significant quantitative improvements when compared with the treebased RIP analysis. Our results have a refreshingly simple interpretation, explicitly determining a bound on the number of measurements that are required as a multiple of the sparsity. For example, we prove that exact recovery of binary tree-based signals from noiseless Gaussian measurements is asymptotically guaranteed for ITP with constant stepsize provided n \u2265 50k. All our results extend to the more realistic case in which measurements are corrupted by noise.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2016.2633415","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7855839/07762164.pdf","startPage":"1555","endPage":"1571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2633415","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantitative Recovery Conditions for Tree-Based Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762164","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762164/","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Recovery Conditions for Tree-Based Compressed Sensing","volume":"63","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16669104","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762164/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Recovery Conditions for Tree-Based Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tit-thompson-2633415-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09768S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7855839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7855839","articleId":"7762164","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762165,"authors":[{"name":"Nian Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8262690/7762165/nliu-2628878-small.gif","p":["Nian Liu received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2012 and 2015, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the School of Automation.","His current research interests include computer vision and multimedia processing, especially on saliency detection and deep learning."]},"firstName":"Nian","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085617796"},{"name":"Junwei Han","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8262690/7762165/han-2628878-small.gif","p":["Junwei Han (M\u201912\u2013SM\u201915) is a currently a Full Professor with Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi\u2019an, China.

Although a lot of previous works have explored these three saliency cues for several years, there still exists much room for improvement on how to model them and integrate them effectively. This paper proposes a novel computation model to predict eye fixations, which adopts a multiresolution convolutional neural network (Mr-CNN) to infer these three types of saliency cues from raw image data simultaneously. The proposed Mr-CNN is trained directly from fixation and nonfixation pixels with multiresolution input image regions with different contexts. It utilizes image pixels as inputs and eye fixation points as labels. Then, both the local and global contrasts are learned by fusing information in multiple contexts. Meanwhile, various top-down factors are learned in higher layers. Finally, optimal combination of top-down factors and bottom-up contrasts can be learned to predict eye fixations. The proposed approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several publically available benchmark databases, demonstrating the superiority of Mr-CNN. We also apply our method to the RGB-D image saliency detection problem. Through learning saliency cues induced by depth and RGB information on pixel level jointly and their interactions, our model achieves better performance on predicting eye fixations in RGB-D images.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2628878","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2628878","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8262690/07762165.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8262690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762165/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Predict Eye Fixations via Multiresolution Convolutional Neural Networks","volume":"29","issue":"2","pubMedId":"27913362","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17519478","htmlLink":"/document/7762165/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2018","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61473231 and 61522207"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Predict Eye Fixations via Multiresolution Convolutional Neural Networks","sourcePdf":"tnnls-han-2628878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061882S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8262690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"8262690","articleId":"7762165","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762169,"authors":[{"name":"Ho Huu Minh Tam","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Ultimo, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7849239/7762169/tam-2633262-small.gif","p":["Ho Huu Minh Tam was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Unlike existing work, the limited backhaul capacity at each base station (BS) is taken into account. Here, users (UEs) cannot be offloaded to any arbitrary BS, but only to ones with sufficient backhaul capacity remaining. Jointly designed with traffic offload, transmit power allocation mitigates the intercell interference to further support the quality of service of each UE. The objective here is either: 1) to maximize the network sum rate subject to minimum throughput requirements at individual UEs, or 2) to maximize the minimum UE throughput. Both formulated problems belong to the difficult class of mixed-integer nonconvex optimization problems. The inherently binary BS-UE association variables are strongly coupled with the transmit power variables, making the problems even more challenging to solve. New iterative algorithms are developed based on an exact penalty method combined with successive convex programming, where the binary BS-UE association problem and the nonconvex power allocation problem are dealt with one at a time. At each iteration of the proposed algorithms, only two simple convex problems need to be solved at the same time scale. It is proven that the algorithms improve the objective functions at each iteration and converge eventually. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in both traffic offloading and interference mitigation.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2633262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2633262","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07762169.pdf","startPage":"872","endPage":"884","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Load Balancing and Interference Management for Small-Cell Heterogeneous Networks With Limited Backhaul Capacity","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/7693/7849239/7762169-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Joint Load Balancing and Interference Management for Small-Cell Heterogeneous Networks With Limited Backhaul Capacity","volume":"16","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762169/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668633","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762169/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council\u2019s Discovery Projects","grantNumber":"DP130104617"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000287","fundingName":"U.K. Royal Academy of Engineering Research Fellowship","grantNumber":"RF1415\\14\\22"},{"fundingName":"Newton Institutional Link","grantNumber":"ID 172719890"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.

This optimization is based on a sensor tag efficiency that evaluates the quality of the tag signal in terms of its amplitude for a reliable power transfer toward the passive tag chip and in terms of its phase for a transmission of the sensing states toward the RFID reader. An antenna transducer prototype for an RFID sensor tag is presented that verifies the concept by detecting three different water filling levels. The prototype achieves a high sensor tag efficiency of 92% at 915 MHz. A reliable power transfer to the passive tag chip is ensured by constant power transmission coefficients of about 90% in all three sensing states. In addition, the phase modulation quality is high and thus shows a high robustness for the detection of the sensing states at the reader. Furthermore, reasonably high tag modulation efficiencies are achieved with a minimum of 11% that ensure a reliable tag ID transmission in each sensing state.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762172/","dateOfInsertion":"07 December 2016","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519014","volume":"64","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Passive RFID Sensor Tag Concept and Prototype Exploiting a Full Control of Amplitude and Phase of the Tag Signal","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Project Kalium Home Monitoring"},{"fundingName":"Austrian Research Promotion Agency"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive RFID Sensor Tag Concept and Prototype Exploiting a Full Control of Amplitude and Phase of the Tag Signal","sourcePdf":"tmtt-grosinger-2623610-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092102S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"7776993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7776993","articleId":"7762172","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":7762173,"authors":[{"name":"Quanzhong Li","affiliation":["Collaborative Innovation Center of High Performance Computing, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha 410000, China","Guangdong Key Laboratory of Information Security, Guangzhou, China","School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7981437/7762173/li-2633380-small.gif","p":["Quanzhong Li received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Sun Yat-Sen\n University (SYSU), Guangzhou, China, in 2009 and 2014, respectively, both in information and communications\n engineering.","He is currently a Lecturer with the School of Data and Computer Science, SYSU.

In this paper, we study the security issue of a nonregenerative multiple-input multiple-out (MIMO) relay system with SWIPT. When the full channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdropper is available, we aim to maximize the secrecy rate under the source and relay transmit power constraints and energy-harvesting (EH) constraints at the multiple EH receivers by jointly designing the source and relay beamforming matrices, which is a nonconvex optimization and is still an open problem. In order to enhance the secrecy rate effectively, we first transform the optimization into a difference of convex programming and propose a sequential parametric convex approximation-based iterative algorithm which is able to achieve a local optimum. To reduce the complexity, we also propose a singular value decomposition (SVD)-generalized SVD-based method to simplify the optimization into a joint source and relay power allocation problem. The alternating optimization is employed to find a suboptimal solution of the joint power allocation problem. When the CSI of the eavesdropper is unknown, we propose an artificial-noise (AN) aided joint source and relay beamforming scheme, which can maximize the AN power to jam the eavesdropper under the limited source and relay transmit power and satisfy the quality of service of the receiver. Simulation results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Source and Relay Secure Beamforming for Nonregenerative MIMO Relay Systems With Wireless Information and Power Transfer","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2633380","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07762173.pdf","startPage":"5853","endPage":"5865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2633380","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762173","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762173/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Source and Relay Secure Beamforming for Nonregenerative MIMO Relay Systems With Wireless Information and Power Transfer","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7762173/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026840","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472458"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030311032 and 2014A030310374"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"15lgpy15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Source and Relay Secure Beamforming for Nonregenerative MIMO Relay Systems With Wireless Information and Power Transfer","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2633380-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094854S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7762173","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762176,"authors":[{"name":"Sissi Xiaoxiao Wu","affiliation":["Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, NT, Hong Kong","Ira A.

In particular, we consider multigroup multicast transmission between long-distance users. Assuming that perfect channel state information is perceived, our goal is to design the AF process so that the max-min-fair signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is optimized while generalized power constraints are satisfied. We propose a beamformed Alamouti (BFA) AF scheme and formulate the corresponding AF design problem as a two-block fractional quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). We then tackle the two-block fractional QCQP using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique and analyze the approximation accuracy of the proposed SDR. From a theoretical perspective, our results are fundamentally new and reveal that the proposed BFA AF scheme can outperform the traditional BF AF scheme, especially when there are many users in the system or many generalized power constraints in the problem formulation. From a practical perspective, our proposed BFA AF scheme improves the receivers' SINR by offering two degrees of freedom (DoFs) in beamformer design, as opposed to only one DoF offered by the BF AF scheme. In the latter part of this paper, we demonstrate how this extra DoF leads to provable performance gain by considering two special relay scenarios, in which the AF process is shown to possess a special structure. Numerical simulations further confirm that the proposed BFA AF scheme outperforms the BF AF scheme and works well for large-scale relay systems.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2633245","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7858803","startPage":"2428","endPage":"2443","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7858803/07762176.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semidefinite Relaxation and Approximation Analysis of a Beamformed Alamouti Scheme for Relay Beamforming Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762176/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May1, 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762176/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Semidefinite Relaxation and Approximation Analysis of a Beamformed Alamouti Scheme for Relay Beamforming Networks","publicationDate":"1 May1, 2017","accessionNumber":"16705738","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"65","issue":"9","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Research Grant Council (RGC) General Research Fund (GRF)","grantNumber":"416012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004853","fundingName":"Chinese University of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"2050506"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semidefinite Relaxation and Approximation Analysis of a Beamformed Alamouti Scheme for Relay Beamforming Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-wu-2633245-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110297S","chronDate":"May1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7858803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7858803","articleId":"7762176","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7762179,"authors":[{"name":"Jaein Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7849239/7762179/kim-2633471-small.gif","p":["Jaein Kim (S\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2014 and 2016, respectively.

A typical WPCN consists of two different phases. In the first downlink phase, a hybrid access point (H-AP) transfers energy to charge users, and then in the subsequent uplink phase, the users send information by using the harvested energy to the H-AP. We consider two different cognitive WPCN protocols depending on the cooperation level between the primary transmitter and the secondary H-AP. For both cases, we formulate sum throughput maximization problems by taking the interference leakage to the primary network into consideration. The problems are generally non-convex due to coupled variables in the WPCN. To tackle this issue, we first convert the problems into equivalent convex forms, and then identify the global optimal solutions by applying the proposed iterative optimization algorithms. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform conventional schemes.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2633471","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07762179.pdf","startPage":"913","endPage":"923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2633471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum Throughput Maximization for Multi-User MIMO Cognitive Wireless Powered Communication Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762179/","displayDocTitle":"Sum Throughput Maximization for Multi-User MIMO Cognitive Wireless Powered Communication Networks","volume":"16","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668596","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762179/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP) of the Korean Government","grantNumber":"2014R1A2A1A10049769"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001321","fundingName":"NRF funded by the MISP of the Korean Government","grantNumber":"NRF-2015R1C1A1A02036927"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum Throughput Maximization for Multi-User MIMO Cognitive Wireless Powered Communication Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-kim-2633471-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100356S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7762179","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762181,"authors":[{"name":"Giancarlo Sportelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Fisica \u201cE.

Blocks of 64 SiPMs are one-to-one coupled to a dual-layer staggered LYSO crystal matrix and read by a single ASIC. The FPGA reads the sparse output from the ASICs and reconstructs for each event a full image of the light pattern coming from the LYSO matrix. This pattern can be then processed on-line or sent to the host PC for post-processing. Early tests were conducted by using a prototype board with single LYSO crystals of 3.3 mm\u00d73.3 mm\u00d78 mm and dual layer staggered LYSO matrices. Results show that the ASIC can sustain input rates above 58 kHz on all its channels, with small variations depending on the discriminating thresholds, being this limit due its digital output stage. With the single crystals setup, we obtained an energy resolution of 10.7% at 511 keV and a coincidence time resolution of 420 ps FWHM. With the staggered matrix the obtained mean energy resolution was 16% on the top layer and 18% on the bottom layer. The flood maps obtained with the LYSO matrix setup show that the pixels on both the staggered levels are clearly identifiable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The TRIMAGE PET Data Acquisition System: Initial Results","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2016.2633237","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/7433213/7886248/07762181.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2016.2633237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7886248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762181/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"The TRIMAGE PET Data Acquisition System: Initial Results","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7762181/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16773958","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"European Union Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013)","grantNumber":"602621-TRIMAGE"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The TRIMAGE PET Data Acquisition System: Initial Results","sourcePdf":"tns-sportelli-2633237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108496S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7433213","isNumber":"7886248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7433213","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7886248","articleId":"7762181","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762183,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Zhenyu","lastName":"Wu","id":"37086101093"},{"name":"Shuming Chen","affiliation":["National Laboratory for Parallel and Distributed Processing and Micro-Electronics and Microprocessor Institute, College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Shuming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37403389300"},{"name":"Junting Yu","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Junting","lastName":"Yu","id":"37086094461"},{"name":"Jianjun Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Jianjun","lastName":"Chen","id":"38248080800"},{"name":"Pengcheng Huang","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Pengcheng","lastName":"Huang","id":"38566116300"},{"name":"Ruiqiang Song","affiliation":["College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), Changsha, China"],"firstName":"Ruiqiang","lastName":"Song","id":"37086100528"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"7762183","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":622},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762183","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protons","Ionization","Random access memory","Silicon","Copper","Metallization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["astronomical instruments","CMOS integrated circuits","ionisation chambers","nuclear electronics","proton detection","radiation hardening (electronics)","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elastic collisions","recoil silicon","recoil oxygen","critical charge SRAM","proton energy","Geant4 simulations","SRAM bit line","ECC","error correction codes","low-energy protons","recoil ion ionization","MCU","multiple cell upsets","SBU","single-bit upsets","proton direct ionization","heavy ion experiment","proton experiment","SEU cross-section","low-energy proton-induced single event upsets","low-energy proton radiation","nanometer CMOS SRAM","recoil-ion-induced single event upsets","electron volt energy 2 MeV to 10 MeV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-energy protons","proton direct ionization","recoil ions","SEUs","SRAM"]}],"abstract":"Low-energy (<;10 MeV) proton-induced single event upsets (SEUs) were investigated through proton and heavy ion experiments on a 65 nm CMOS bulk SRAM. It is unlikely that 2-10 MeV proton direct ionization can induce SEUs in the 65 nm SRAM and the observed single-bit upsets (SBUs) and multiple cell upsets (MCUs) are mainly induced by the ionization from the recoil ions. The MCUs induced by low-energy protons in our 65 nm SRAM can be corrected by the error correction codes (ECC) because they usually occur along the SRAM bit line. The Geant4 simulations revealed that the SEU cross-section may show two different trends for 2-10 MeV protons depending on the critical charge for triggering a SEU. With the increase of proton energy, SEUs in small critical charge SRAM tend to decrease while SEUs in large critical charge SRAM tend to increase. Further, the Geant4 simulations demonstrated that the SEUs induced by recoil oxygen are more than those induced by recoil silicon and SEUs induced by recoil ions from elastic collisions dominate in our 65 nm CMOS SRAM under 2-10 MeV proton radiation.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2016.2633405","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7869242/07762183.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"664","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2016.2633405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recoil-Ion-Induced Single Event Upsets in Nanometer CMOS SRAM Under Low-Energy Proton Radiation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762183/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Recoil-Ion-Induced Single Event Upsets in Nanometer CMOS SRAM Under Low-Energy Proton Radiation","volume":"64","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16721601","htmlLink":"/document/7762183/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61376109, 61434007 and 61504169"},{"fundingName":"NUDT","grantNumber":"0100066314001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recoil-Ion-Induced Single Event Upsets in Nanometer CMOS SRAM Under Low-Energy Proton Radiation","sourcePdf":"tns-zhenyu-2633405-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088914S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7869242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7869242","articleId":"7762183","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7762185,"authors":[{"name":"Fengli Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory on Microwave and Digital Communications and the Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/7900486/7762185/xu-2623950-small.gif","p":["Fengli Xu received the B.S. degree in electronics and information engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2015.

This paper aims at extracting and modeling the traffic patterns of large scale towers deployed in a metropolitan city. To achieve this goal, we need to address several challenges, including lack of appropriate tools for processing large scale traffic measurement data, unknown traffic patterns, as well as handling complicated factors of urban ecology and human behaviors that affect traffic patterns. Our core contribution is a powerful model which combines three dimensional information (time, locations of towers, and traffic frequency spectrum) to extract and model the traffic patterns of thousands of cellular towers. Our empirical analysis reveals the following important observations. First, only five basic time-domain traffic patterns exist among the 9600 cellular towers. Second, each of the extracted traffic pattern maps to one type of geographical locations related to urban ecology, including residential area, business district, transport, entertainment, and comprehensive area. Third, our frequency-domain traffic spectrum analysis suggests that the traffic of any tower among 9600 can be constructed using a linear combination of four primary components corresponding to human activity behaviors. We believe that the proposed traffic patterns extraction and modeling methodology, combined with the empirical analysis on the mobile traffic, pave the way toward a deep understanding of the traffic patterns of large scale cellular towers in modern metropolis.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2016.2623950","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2016.2623950","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1161","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7900486/07762185.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7900486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Understanding Mobile Traffic Patterns of Large Scale Cellular Towers in Urban Environment","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Understanding Mobile Traffic Patterns of Large Scale Cellular Towers in Urban Environment","volume":"25","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 April 2017","accessionNumber":"16808653","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762185/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB329105"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301080, 91338203, 91338102 and 61321061"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004147","fundingName":"Research Fund of Tsinghua University","grantNumber":"20161080099"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Understanding Mobile Traffic Patterns of Large Scale Cellular Towers in Urban Environment","sourcePdf":"tnet-li-2623950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090606S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7900486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"7900486","articleId":"7762185","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7762186,"authors":[{"name":"Cl\u00e9mentine Durnez","affiliation":["SAESUPAERO, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Image Sensor Research Team, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Cl\u00e9mentine","lastName":"Durnez","id":"37085480035"},{"name":"Vincent Goiffon","affiliation":["SAESUPAERO, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Image Sensor Research Team, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Vincent","lastName":"Goiffon","id":"37593862700"},{"name":"C\u00e9dric Virmontois","affiliation":["CNES (Centre National d\u2019\u00c9tudes Spatiales), Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"C\u00e9dric","lastName":"Virmontois","id":"38327725000"},{"name":"Jean-Marc Belloir","affiliation":["SAESUPAERO, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Image Sensor Research Team, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Marc","lastName":"Belloir","id":"37085385939"},{"name":"Pierre Magnan","affiliation":["SAESUPAERO, Universit\u00e9 de Toulouse, Image Sensor Research Team, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Magnan","id":"37400751600"},{"name":"Laurent Rubaldo","affiliation":["SOFRADIR, Veurey-Voroize, France"],"firstName":"Laurent","lastName":"Rubaldo","id":"37296445200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"7762186","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":476},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dark current","Switches","CMOS image sensors","Photonic band gap","Histograms","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace materials","image sensors","radiation hardening (electronics)","silicon","switching","telegraphy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-depth analysis","radiation induced multilevel dark current random telegraph signal","silicon solid state image sensors","space application","protons","electrons","crystalline structure","switches","switch detection","Random Telegraph Signals","discrete levels","switching times"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS image sensor","radiation induced phenomenon","random telegraph signal"]}],"abstract":"Radiation-induced phenomena constitute a big concern for image sensors dedicated to space application.

Learning designers orchestrate MOOC content to engage learners at scale and retain interest by carefully mixing videos, lectures, readings, quizzes, and discussions. Universally, far fewer people actually participate in MOOCs than originally sign up with a steady attrition as courses progress. Studies have correlated social engagement to completion rates. The FutureLearn MOOC platform specifically provides opportunities to share opinions and to reflect by posting comments, replying, or following discussion threads. This paper investigates learners' social behaviors in MOOCs and the impact of engagement on course completion. A preliminary study suggested that dropout rates will be lower when learners engage in repeated and frequent social interactions. We subsequently reviewed the literature of prediction models and applied social network analysis techniques to characterize participants' online interactions examining implications for participant achievements. We analyzed discussions in an eight week FutureLearn MOOC, with 9,855 enrolled learners. Findings indicate that if a learner starts following someone, the probability of their finishing the course is increased; if learners also interact with those they follow, they are highly likely to complete, both important factors to add to the prediction of completion model.","doi":"10.1109/TLT.2016.2633268","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TLT.2016.2633268","startPage":"475","endPage":"487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Learning Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel7/4620076/8207712/07762189.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8207712","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How Learners\u2019 Interactions Sustain Engagement: A MOOC Case Study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"How Learners\u2019 Interactions Sustain Engagement: A MOOC Case Study","volume":"10","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2017","accessionNumber":"17525644","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762189/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Learners\u2019 Interactions Sustain Engagement: A MOOC Case Study","sourcePdf":"tlt-sunar-2633268-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104181S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"4620076","isNumber":"8207712","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4620076","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8207712","articleId":"7762189","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Traditional","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762191,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoyin Bai","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7762191/bai-2626301-small.gif","p":["Xiaoyin Bai (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology, Beijing, China, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 2011.

An iterative procedure, whose convergence is analytically proved, is devised to maximize the Signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) accounting for both a similarity constraint and a constant modulus requirement on the probing waveform. Each iteration of the algorithm involves the solution of hidden convex problems. Specifically, both a convex problem (whose solution is provided in closed form) and a set of fractional programming problems, that can be globally solved in polynomial time via the Dinkelback's procedure, are settled. The computational complexity is linear with the number of iterations and polynomial with the sizes of the STTC and the STRF. In particular, the proposed technique provides a monotonic SINR improvement without limitations on the size of the similarity constraint and ensures convergence to a stationary point filling these important gaps in the open literature. Besides, the reported results highlight that the new devised procedure outperforms both in the optimized SINR value and the computational complexity than the available counterparts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762192/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2017","volume":"65","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"16596024","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2016","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762192/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Space-Time Transmit Code and Receive Filter Design for Colocated MIMO Radar","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201276 and 61301266"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds of Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2013J012, ZYGX2014J013 and ZYGX2014Z005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-Time Transmit Code and Receive Filter Design for Colocated MIMO Radar","sourcePdf":"tsp-cui-2633242-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.143898S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7782900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7782900","articleId":"7762192","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762198,"authors":[{"name":"Alejandro Valero","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Systems Engineering, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain","Department of Computer Engineering, Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Val\u00e8ncia, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7862316/7762198/valer-2625809-small.gif","p":["Alejandro Valero received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from the Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia, Val\u00e8ncia, Spain, all in computer engineering.","He has been a Visiting Researcher with Northeastern University, Boston, MA, USA, and the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, U.K. He is currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer and Systems Engineering, University of Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.

This voltage degradation causes slower transistor switching and eventually can result in faulty operation. HCI manifests itself when transistors switch from logic \u201c0\u201d to \u201c1\u201d and vice versa, whereas BTI is the result of a transistor maintaining the same logic value for an extended period of time. These failure mechanisms are especially acute in those transistors used to implement the SRAM cells of first-level (L1) caches, which are frequently accessed, so they are critical to performance, and they are continuously aging. This paper focuses on microarchitectural solutions to reduce transistor aging effects induced by both HCI and BTI in the data array of L1 data caches. First, we show that the majority of cell flips are concentrated in a small number of specific bits within each data word. In addition, we also build upon the previous studies, showing that logic \u201c0\u201d is the most frequently written value in a cache by identifying which cells hold a given logic value for a significant amount of time. Based on these observations, this paper introduces a number of architectural techniques that spread the number of flips evenly across memory cells and reduce the amount of time that logic \u201c0\u201d values are stored in the cells by switching OFF specific data bytes. Experimental results show that the threshold voltage degradation savings range from 21.8% to 44.3% depending on the application.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762198/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"25","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16691047","dateOfInsertion":"22 February 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762198/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On Microarchitectural Mechanisms for Cache Wearout Reduction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Spanish Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad within the Plan E Funds","grantNumber":"TIN2015-66972-C5-1-R"},{"fundingName":"HiPEAC Collaboration"},{"fundingName":"FP7 HiPEAC Network of Excellence","grantNumber":"287759"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K026399/1 and EP/J016284/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Microarchitectural Mechanisms for Cache Wearout Reduction","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-valero-2625809-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10526S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7862316","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7862316","articleId":"7762198","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762199,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Reza Heidarpour","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7874223/7762199/heida-2633354-small.gif","p":["Ali Reza Heidarpour received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran, in 2013, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Ozyegin University, Istanbul, Turkey, in 2016.

The combined use of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with NCC has been further studied in the literature to exploit the multipath diversity gains. In this paper, we consider orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA), an extension of OFDM to a multiuser system where subsets of carriers are assigned to different users. We first derive a closed-form expression for the outage probability of NCC-OFDMA over Rician fading channels and then present the asymptotical and finite-SNR DMT expressions. Our results provide insight into the performance mechanisms under practical SNR regime of NCC-OFDMA systems and demonstrate that NCC-OFDMA is able to fully exploit both frequency and spatial diversity. We also show that the derived finite-SNR DMT converges to an asymptotical one as expected. Furthermore, special cases for our derived analytical expressions are presented, to show that the derived expression is a generalized case of the related the state of the art results. Simulation results are further presented to verify our theoretical analyses.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2633354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7874223/07762199.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2633354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874223","startPage":"1385","endPage":"1396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-SNR Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff for Network Coded Cooperative OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-SNR Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff for Network Coded Cooperative OFDMA Systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16725097","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762199/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TUBITAK","grantNumber":"113E294"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-SNR Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff for Network Coded Cooperative OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-heidarpour-2633354-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10751S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7762199","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762205,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Rezaei Khezeli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, G.

The worst case crosstalk delays for both repeated and unrepeated interconnect and the peak crosstalk noise voltage on the victim net are investigated. Analyses have been done for global level multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) bundle and copper interconnects with carbon nanotube FET-based drivers and receivers at 22 nm node. According to the HSPICE simulations, the crosstalk delay and noise area in the MWCNT bundle interconnects are much smaller than the Cu wires for the ternary logic. In addition, the MWCNT bundle interconnects require a lower number of repeaters as compared to the Cu wires, which results in lower complexity and power consumption. The results indicate that utilizing the MWCNT interconnects instead of Cu wires in ternary systems leads to 63% shorter crosstalk delay without repeater insertion and 65% lower crosstalk noise area and 75% lower power consumption with repeater insertion. It is concluded from the results that the MWCNT bundle global wires are more suitable for ternary very large scale integration systems as compared to the Cu wires.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/7809217/07762205.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"117","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2016.2633460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2016.2633460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809217","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Crosstalk Effects for Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube Bundle Interconnects in Ternary Logic and Comparison With Cu Interconnects","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuit interconnections","Crosstalk","Wires","Integrated circuit modeling","Delays","CNTFETs","Quantum capacitance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["copper","crosstalk","driver circuits","integrated circuit interconnections","multi-wall carbon nanotubes","ternary logic","wires (electric)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["crosstalk effect analysis","multiwalled carbon nanotube bundle interconnect","ternary logic","copper interconnects","crosstalk-induced effect","three-line bus architecture","crosstalk noise voltage","carbon nanotube FET-based driver","HSPICE simulation","crosstalk delay","MWCNT bundle interconnect","copper wires","power consumption","size 22 nm","Cu"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple valued logic (MVL)","multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT)","interconnect","crosstalk"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762205/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Crosstalk Effects for Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube Bundle Interconnects in Ternary Logic and Comparison With Cu Interconnects","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7762205/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16597942","dateOfInsertion":"11 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Crosstalk Effects for Multiwalled Carbon Nanotube Bundle Interconnects in Ternary Logic and Comparison With Cu Interconnects","sourcePdf":"tnano-moaiyeri-2633460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091562S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"7809217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7809217","articleId":"7762205","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762210,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Reza Abedi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7849239/7762210/abedi-2633336-small.gif","p":["Mohammad Reza Abedi received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from the Amirkabir University of Technology, Tehran, Iran.

In the considered system, we assume that both legitimate receiver and eavesdropper are full-duplex (FD) while most works in the literature concentrate on passive eavesdroppers and half-duplex (HD) legitimate receivers. In this paper, the adversary intends to optimize its transmit and jamming signal parameters so as to minimize the secrecy data rate of the legitimate transmission. In the literature, assuming that the receiver operates in HD mode, secrecy data rate maximization problems subject to the power transmission constraint have been considered in which cooperating nodes act as jammers to confound the eavesdropper. This paper investigates an alternative solution in which we take advantage of FD capability of the receiver to send jamming signals against the eavesdroppers. The proposed self-protection scheme eliminates the need for external helpers. Moreover, we consider the channel state information uncertainty on the links between the active eavesdropper and other legitimate nodes of the network. Optimal power allocation is then obtained based on the worst-case secrecy data rate maximization, under a legitimate transmitter power constraint in the presence of the active eavesdropper. Numerical results confirm the advantage of the proposed secrecy design and in certain conditions, demonstrate substantial performance gain over the conventional approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762210/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","volume":"16","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"16668637","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762210/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Robust Resource Allocation to Enhance Physical Layer Security in Systems With Full-Duplex Receivers: Active Adversary","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003968","fundingName":"Iran National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"92028129"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Resource Allocation to Enhance Physical Layer Security in Systems With Full-Duplex Receivers: Active Adversary","sourcePdf":"twc-saeedi-2633336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127393S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7762210","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762212,"authors":[{"name":"Huanqing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Bohai University, Jinzhou, China","Department of Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7955029/7762212/wang-2627048-small.gif","p":["Huanqing Wang received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Bohai University, Jinzhou, China, in 2003, the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Inner Mongolia University, Huhhot, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from the Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China, in 2013.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, ON, Canada, in 2014.

A variable partition technique is applied to surmount the difficulty in the nonlinear functions of whole state variables. By utilizing the backstepping recursive design approach and the universal approximation capability of neural networks, an adaptive neural controller is systemically designed. Then, based on the utilization of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals, the semiglobally uniform boundedness of all closed-loop signals is guaranteed. Finally, the suggested control method is verified through a numerical example. The main advantage of this paper is that an intelligent control method is developed for pure-feedback nonlinear systems with state time delay, unmodeled dynamics and nonlower triangular form. Further developments will focus on how to deal with the problem of output feedback control of pure-feedback nonlinear time-delay systems with unmodeled dynamics and nonlower-triangular structure.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762212/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","volume":"47","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969218","htmlLink":"/document/7762212/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Intelligent Control of Nonaffine Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems With Dynamic Uncertainties","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61304002, 61175072 and 61473160"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005047","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China","grantNumber":"2015020058"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Intelligent Control of Nonaffine Nonlinear Time-Delay Systems With Dynamic Uncertainties","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wang-2627048-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101975S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7955029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"7955029","articleId":"7762212","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762220,"authors":[{"name":"Meng Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7951114/7762220/wu-2633462-small.gif","p":["Meng Wu (S\u201914) received the B.E. degree from Tianjin\n University, Tianjin, China, in 2010, and the M.Eng. degree from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, in 2011, both in\n electrical engineering.

A current trend in BSS is the semiblind approach, which incorporates prior information on sources or how the sources are mixed. The constrained independent component analysis (ICA) approach has been studied to impose constraints on the famous ICA framework. We introduced an alternative approach based on the null space component (NCA) framework and referred to the approach as the c-NCA approach. We also presented the c-NCA algorithm that uses signal-dependent semidefinite operators, which is a bilinear mapping, as signatures for operator design in the c-NCA approach. Theoretically, we showed that the source estimation of the c-NCA algorithm converges with a convergence rate dependent on the decay of the sequence, obtained by applying the estimated operators on corresponding sources. The c-NCA can be formulated as a deterministic constrained optimization method, and thus, it can take advantage of solvers developed in optimization society for solving the BSS problem. As examples, we demonstrated electroencephalogram interference rejection problems can be solved by the c-NCA with proximal splitting algorithms by incorporating a sparsity-enforcing separation model and considering the case when reference signals are available.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/8262690/07762224.pdf","startPage":"377","endPage":"391","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2628400","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2628400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8262690","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained Null Space Component Analysis for Semiblind Source Separation Problem","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blind source separation","Brain modeling","Null space","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blind source separation","electroencephalography","independent component analysis","medical signal processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["null space component analysis","semiblind source separation problem","constrained independent component analysis approach","impose constraints","famous ICA framework","c-NCA approach","signal-dependent semidefinite operators","deterministic constrained optimization method","BSS problem","electroencephalogram interference rejection problems","sparsity-enforcing separation model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blind source separation (BSS)","constrained ICA (c-ICA)","null space component analysis","semiblind source separation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762224/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","displayDocTitle":"Constrained Null Space Component Analysis for Semiblind Source Separation Problem","volume":"29","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7762224/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","accessionNumber":"17519489","pubMedId":"27913361","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained Null Space Component Analysis for Semiblind Source Separation Problem","sourcePdf":"tnnls-hwang-2628400-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162068S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8262690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"8262690","articleId":"7762224","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762226,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanrui Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7849239/7762226/zhang-2633351-small.gif","p":["Yuanrui Zhang received the B.Sc. degree in communication engineering from Shandong University, China, in 2009, and the M.Sc. degree in communication and information technology from the University of Bremen, Bremen, Germany, in 2012, and the Ph.D. degree in wireless innovation from the Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Belfast, U.K., in 2016.

This paper formalizes this concept by proposing a novel definition for the security level of such a legitimate transmission, called the spatial secrecy outage probability (SSOP). By performing a theoretical and numerical analysis, it is shown how the antenna array parameters can affect the SSOP and its analytic upper bound. While this approach may be applied to any array type and any fading channel model, it is shown here how the security performance of a uniform linear array varies in a Rician fading channel by examining the analytic SSOP upper bound.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762226/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","volume":"16","issue":"2","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"16668602","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762226/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Defining Spatial Secrecy Outage Probability for Exposure Region-Based Beamforming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007863","fundingName":"U.S.-Ireland R&D Partnership involving Rice University, USA, University College Dublin, Ireland, and Queens University Belfast, Northern Ireland through the Project WiPhyLoc8","grantNumber":"USI033"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Defining Spatial Secrecy Outage Probability for Exposure Region-Based Beamforming","sourcePdf":"twc-woods-2633351-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123193S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7762226","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7762231,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Evans","affiliation":["IROC Technologies, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Evans","id":"37363784900"},{"name":"Carlos Urbina Ortega","affiliation":["European Space Agency (ESA), Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Urbina Ortega","id":"37085560315"},{"name":"Kostas Marinis","affiliation":["European Space Agency (ESA), Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Kostas","lastName":"Marinis","id":"37085521721"},{"name":"Enrico Costenaro","affiliation":["IROC Technologies, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Costenaro","id":"37946129100"},{"name":"Houssem Laroussi","affiliation":["European Space Agency (ESA), Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Houssem","lastName":"Laroussi","id":"37086060649"},{"name":"Kay-Voss Obbe","affiliation":["Helmholtzzentrum f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung, Darmstadt, GSI, Germany"],"firstName":"Kay-Voss","lastName":"Obbe","id":"37086066429"},{"name":"Giorgio Magistrati","affiliation":["European Space Agency (ESA), Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Magistrati","id":"37085386446"},{"name":"V\u00e9ronique Ferlet-Cavrois","affiliation":["European Space Agency (ESA), Noordwijk, Netherlands"],"firstName":"V\u00e9ronique","lastName":"Ferlet-Cavrois","id":"38277339600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9499"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1578"}],"articleNumber":"7762231","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":459},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/nps/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762231","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ions","Random access memory","Process control","Field programmable gate arrays","Switches","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Read only memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","microcontrollers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heavy-ion microbeam","flash-based FPGA microcontroller","ARM CortexR-M0+ processor","RHBD techniques","silent data corruption","flip-flop limitations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded systems","embedded processor","field programmable gate array","radiation hardening","reliability","single event transient (SET)","single event upset (SEU) single event"]}],"abstract":"Flash-based FPGAs are frequently used in space applications and it is now common for such designs to include a small microcontroller.

Parallel programming models need to be able to suit the needs of such systems and keep on increasing the application\u2019s portability and efficiency. This paper proposes two task scheduling approaches that target asymmetric systems. These dynamic scheduling policies reduce total execution time either by detecting the longest or the critical path of the dynamic task dependency graph of the application, or by finding the earliest executor of a task. They use dynamic scheduling and information discoverable during execution, fact that makes them implementable and functional without the need of off-line profiling. In our evaluation we compare these scheduling approaches with two existing state-of the art heterogeneous schedulers and we track their improvement over a FIFO baseline scheduler. We show that the heterogeneous schedulers improve the baseline by up to 1.45\n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n in a real 8-core asymmetric system and up to 2.1\n<inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\times$</tex-math></inline-formula>\n in a simulated 32-core asymmetric chip.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2016.2633347","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2016.2633347","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7946232/07762236.pdf","startPage":"2074","endPage":"2087","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7946232","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task Scheduling Techniques for Asymmetric Multi-Core Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Task Scheduling Techniques for Asymmetric Multi-Core Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762236/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2017","isJournal":true,"volume":"28","issue":"7","publicationDate":"1 July 2017","dateOfInsertion":"12 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762236/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Government","grantNumber":"SEV2015-0493"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004837","fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation","grantNumber":"TIN2015-65316-P"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002809","fundingName":"Generalitat de Catalunya","grantNumber":"2014-SGR-1051 and 2014-SGR-1272"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"ERC","grantNumber":"GA 321253"},{"fundingName":"European HiPEAC Network of Excellence"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"EU\u2019s Seventh Framework Programme","grantNumber":"FP7/2007-2013 and 610402"},{"fundingName":"EU\u2019s H2020 Framework Programme","grantNumber":"H2020/2014-2020 and 671697"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness"},{"fundingName":"Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral fellowship","grantNumber":"JCI-2012-15047"},{"fundingName":"Secretary for Universities and Research"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Economy and Knowledge"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002809","fundingName":"Government of Catalonia"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004963","fundingName":"7th R&D Framework Programme of the European Union","grantNumber":"2013 BP_B 00243"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task Scheduling Techniques for Asymmetric Multi-Core Systems","sourcePdf":"tpds-chronaki-2633347-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120601S","chronDate":"July 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7946232","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7946232","articleId":"7762236","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762239,"authors":[{"name":"Shogo Muramatsu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7782900/7762239/muram-2633240-small.gif","p":["Shogo Muramatsu (M\u201993\u2013SM\u201914) received the B.E.,\n M.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Tokyo Metropolitan University, Tokyo, Japan, in 1993, 1995 and 1998, respectively.

NSOLTs allow us to achieve an overcomplete analysis-synthesis system with nonseparable, symmetric, real-valued, overlapping, and compact-supported filters. The proposed systems are based on lattice structures and the redundancy is flexibly controlled by the number of channels and downsampling ratio. The proposed structure is shown to be capable of constructing Parseval tight frames in any number of dimensions. The number of design parameters are examined under the Parseval tight frame constraint. In order to design NSOLTs specified for sparse approximation of image or volume data, an example-based design procedure is introduced. The effectiveness of this method is verified by examining design samples and evaluating their sparse approximation performance using the iterative hard thresholding algorithm for a natural image and MRI volume data patch.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2633240","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2633240","startPage":"1251","endPage":"1264","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7782900/07762239.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7782900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multidimensional Nonseparable Oversampled Lapped Transforms: Theory and Design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"29 November 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2017","displayDocTitle":"Multidimensional Nonseparable Oversampled Lapped Transforms: Theory and Design","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2017","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2016","volume":"65","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762239/","accessionNumber":"16577512","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762239/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000646","fundingName":"JSPS","grantNumber":"JP26420347"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multidimensional Nonseparable Oversampled Lapped Transforms: Theory and Design","sourcePdf":"tsp-muramatsu-2633240-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110872S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7782900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7782900","articleId":"7762239","onlineDate":"29 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7762368,"authors":[{"name":"W.G.

The proposed method can not only achieve good linearization effect, but also greatly simplifies the system structure. A simple MIMO system with 2\u00d74 beamformer is constructed to evaluate the proposed method. The experiment is based on two Long Term Evolution (LTE) signals with different bandwidth and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) operating at 2.12 GHz and 2.18 GHz, respectively.

The DMIMO system employs multiple relays with single or multiple antennas that opportunistically form virtual antenna array (VAA) in between the source and destination. Moving to the DMIMO-OFDM system from the conventional network with uncoordinated nodes requires robust synchronization and tracking. The signal received at the destination is characterized by multiple timing offsets (MTOs), multiple carrier frequency offsets (MCFOs), and frequency-selective channel gains. In this paper, we address the issue of joint time frequency and channel gain estimation for the estimate-and-forward (EF) relaying protocol. EF is a cost-effective solution but provides coarse estimation at the relays introducing intercarrier interferences (ICIs). OFDM system is very sensitive to the ICIs. We propose two iterative estimators: expectation conditional maximization (ECM) and space-alternating generalized expectation maximization (SAGE) to jointly estimate MTOs, MCFOs, and channel gains in the presence of ICIs. The robustness of the estimators is analyzed through mathematical formulation and simulations. The performances of the estimators are measured in terms of mean square error (MSE) and bit error rate (BER). The MSE performance is further verified with the theoretical Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) derived. Simulation results show that the proposed estimators provide a significant performance gain in the DMIMO-OFDM system with MIMO configuration at the relays compared to the single-input single-output (SISO) system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Estimation of Time, Frequency Offsets, and Channel Gains With ICIs in EF Multi-relay DMIMO-OFDM System","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2634084","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07762722.pdf","startPage":"5822","endPage":"5838","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2634084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762722/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"Joint Estimation of Time, Frequency Offsets, and Channel Gains With ICIs in EF Multi-relay DMIMO-OFDM System","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7762722/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026888","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Estimation of Time, Frequency Offsets, and Channel Gains With ICIs in EF Multi-relay DMIMO-OFDM System","sourcePdf":"tvt-chakraborty-2634084-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105496S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7762722","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762726,"authors":[{"name":"Chen Peng","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering and Automation, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/8012582/7762726/peng-2634122-small.gif","p":["Chen Peng (SM\u201915) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from the\n Chinese University of Mining Technology, Xuzhou, China, in 1999 and 2002, respectively.

The LFC design specifically takes the presence of DoS attacks into account. First, an area control error dependent time delay model is delicately constructed for multi-area closed-loop power systems. Second, a resilient event-triggering communication (RETC) scheme is well designed, which allows a degree of packet losses induced by DoS attacks and has the advantage of improving the transaction efficiency. Then, by using the Lyapunov theory, two stability and stabilization criteria for the multi-area power systems are derived under consideration of the energy-limited DoS attacks. In these criteria, the relationship between the allowable DoS attack duration and the resilient event-triggering communication parameters are clearly revealed. Moreover, an algorithm is also provided to obtain the RETC parameters and the LFC gains simultaneously.

However, the caching strategy design at the wireless edge is challenging, especially when both wired backhaul condition and wireless channel quality are considered in the optimization. In this paper, taking into account the conditions of the backhaul in terms of delay and wireless channel quality, joint design and optimization of the caching and user association policy to minimize the average download delay is studied in a cache-enabled heterogeneous network. We first prove the joint caching and association optimization problem is NP-hard based on a reduction to the facility location problem. Furthermore, in order to reduce the complexity, a distributed algorithm is developed by decomposing the NP-hard problem into an assignment problem solvable by the Hungarian method and two simple linear integer subproblems, with the aid of McCormick envelopes and the Lagrange partial relaxation method. Simulation results reveal a near-optimal performance that performs up to 22% better in term of delay compared with those in the literatures at a low complexity of O(nm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sup>\n/\u03b5\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n).","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2633488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","startPage":"8625","endPage":"8633","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07762733.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Caching Placement and User Association for Minimizing User Download Delay","topic":"Wireless Cachiing Technique for 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762733/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762733/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Caching Placement and User Association for Minimizing User Download Delay","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16587987","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61461136002"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Joint Research Fund for Overseas Chinese, Hong Kong and Macao Young Scientists of the National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61428102"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Joint Caching Placement and User Association for Minimizing User Download Delay","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2633488-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091546S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Wireless Cachiing Technique for 5G"],"articleId":"7762733","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7762734,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7762734/zhang-2634025-small.gif","p":["Yu Zhang received the B.S. degree from Soochow University, Suzhou, China, in 2010, and the M.S. degree from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2014.

Based on a parametric channel model, we present a new concept of the joint angle-delay subspace, which can be tracked by the low-complexity low-rank adaptive filtering algorithm. Then, we investigate an interference-free transmission condition that the joint angle-delay subspaces of the users reusing the same pilots are non-overlapping. Since the channel statistics are usually unknown, we develop a robust minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator under the worst precondition of pilot decontamination, considering that the joint angle-delay subspaces of the interfering users fully overlap. Furthermore, motivated by the interference-free transmission criteria, we present a novel low-complexity greedy pilot scheduling algorithm to avoid the problem of initial value sensitivity. Simulation results show that the joint angle-delay subspace can be estimated effectively, and the proposed pilot reuse scheme combined with robust MMSE channel estimation offers significant performance gains.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2634025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07762734.pdf","startPage":"10166","endPage":"10179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2634025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems by Tracking the Joint Angle-Delay Subspace","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762734","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762734/","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems by Tracking the Joint Angle-Delay Subspace","volume":"4","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16606906","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762734/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB336600"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271205, 61501113, 61521061 and 61372100"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (863 Program)","grantNumber":"2014AA01A704"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150630"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Science and Technology Cooperation Program of China","grantNumber":"2014DFT10290"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Channel Estimation for Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems by Tracking the Joint Angle-Delay Subspace","sourcePdf":"access-zhang-2634025-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114863S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7762734","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762739,"authors":[{"name":"Shahin Vakilinia","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, \u00c9cole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7762739/vakil-2633558-small.gif","p":["Shahin Vakilinia (S\u201907) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2008 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, in 2015.

The issue of disorganized power consumption can be categorized into two main groups: one caused by server operations and one occurred during the network communications. In this paper, a platform for virtual machine (VM) placement/migration is proposed to minimize the total power consumption of cloud data centers (DCs). The main idea behind this paper is that with the collaboration of optimization scheduling and estimation techniques, the power consumption of DC can be optimally lessened. In the platform, an estimation module has been embedded to predict the future loads of the system, and then, two schedulers are considered to schedule the expected and unpredicted loads, respectively. The proposed scheduler applies the column generation technique to handle the integer linear/quadratic programming optimization problem. Also, the cut-and-solve-based algorithm and the call back method are proposed to reduce the complexity and computation time. Finally, numerical and experimental results are presented to validate our findings. Adaptation and scalability of the proposed platform result in a notable performance in VM placement and migration processes. We believe that our work advances the state of the art in workload estimation and dynamic power management of cloud DCs, and the results will be helpful to cloud service providers in achieving energy saving.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2633558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07762739.pdf","startPage":"8544","endPage":"8557","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2633558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficient Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing Environments","topic":"Future Networks: Architectures, Protocols, and Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762739/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficient Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing Environments","htmlLink":"/document/7762739/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2017","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16587992","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy Efficient Resource Allocation in Cloud Computing Environments","sourcePdf":"access-vakilinia-2633558-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10942S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Future Networks: Architectures, Protocols, and Applications"],"articleId":"7762739","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762747,"authors":[{"name":"Roberta Palmeri","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, University Mediterranea of Reggio Calabria, Reggio Calabria, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7839250/7762747/palme-2633070-small.gif","p":["Roberta Palmeri (S\u201915) was born in Catania, Italy, in 1989.

We consider applying the well-known linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer (BF) for extracting individual speakers. Constraints are defined using relative transfer functions (RTFs) for the sources, which are ratios of acoustic transfer functions (ATFs) between any microphone and a reference microphone. The latter are usually estimated by methods that rely on single-talk time segments where only a single source is active and on reliable knowledge of the source activity. Two novel algorithms for estimation of RTFs using the \u201cTriple N\u201d ICA for convolutive mixtures (TRINICON) framework are proposed, not resorting to the usually unavailable source activity pattern. The first algorithm estimates the RTFs of the sources by applying multiple two-channel geometrically constrained (GC) TRINICON units, where approximate direction of arrival information for the sources is utilized for ensuring convergence to the desired solution. The GC-TRINICON is applied to all microphone pairs using a common reference microphone. In the second algorithm, we propose to estimate RTFs iteratively using GC-TRINICON, where instead of using a fixed reference microphone as before, we suggest to use the output signals of LCMV-BFs from the previous iteration as spatially processed references with improved signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio. For both algorithms, a simple detection of noise-only time segments is required for estimating the covariance matrix of noise and interference. We conduct an experimental study in which the performance of the proposed methods is confirmed and compared to corresponding supervised methods.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2016.2633806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7797574","startPage":"320","endPage":"332","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/7797574/07762749.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combined LCMV-TRINICON Beamforming for Separating Multiple Speech Sources in Noisy and Reverberant Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762749/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762749/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Combined LCMV-TRINICON Beamforming for Separating Multiple Speech Sources in Noisy and Reverberant Environments","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16561005","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combined LCMV-TRINICON Beamforming for Separating Multiple Speech Sources in Noisy and Reverberant Environments","sourcePdf":"taslp-gannot-2633806-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162563S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7797574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7797574","articleId":"7762749","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7762763,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0002-9708-2975","id":"37085742317"},{"name":"Kwok Wa Leung","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Kwok Wa","lastName":"Leung","orcid":"0000-0002-3705-5190","id":"37279720400"},{"name":"Kai Lu","affiliation":["The Antenna Company NL, Eindhoven, The Netherlands","State Key Laboratory of Millimeter Waves, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Lu","orcid":"0000-0003-2259-3882","id":"38023397000"},{"name":"Nan Wu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, Guizhou Normal University, Guiyang, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Wu","orcid":"0000-0002-6298-7010","id":"37086151056"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7762763","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":36,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2746},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Omnidirectional Circularly Polarized Dielectric Resonator Antenna With Logarithmic Spiral Slots in the Ground","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762763","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna measurements","Light emitting diodes","Prototypes","Battery charge measurement","Gain measurement","Antenna radiation patterns"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric resonator antennas","omnidirectional antennas","UHF antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["omnidirectional antenna","circularly polarized antenna","cylindrical dielectric resonator antenna","open-ended logarithmic spiral slots","slotted ground plane","omnidirectional CP fields","glass dielectric resonator","dual-function DRA","WLAN band","bandwidth 2.4 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circular polarization","dielectric resonator antenna (DRA)","dual-function antenna","glass antenna","transparent antenna"]}],"abstract":"A new omnidirectional circularly polarized (CP) cylindrical dielectric resonator (DR) antenna (DRA) is excited by four open-ended logarithmic spiral slots in the ground plane.

However, due to the fluctuating nature of renewable energy sources, the energy harvested by base stations (BSs) may not fit for their load conditions. The transmit power of the BS needs to be redesigned again. Hence, this paper considers power control in energy cooperation enabled millimeter wave networks, to alleviate the harvested energy imbalance problem and reduce the energy waste. Each BS is solely powered by renewable energy sources and the harvested energy is allowed to be transferred between BSs. Each BS needs to determine whether the energy should be stored in the battery or transferred to others at each time slot. In this paper, power control is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem, aiming at maximizing the time average network utility while keeping the network stable. An online algorithm called dynamic energy-aware power allocation is proposed based on Lyapunov optimization, which does not need to acquire any statistical knowledge of channels and traffic arrivals. Simulation results show that compared with the power control scheme without energy cooperation, the proposed algorithm with energy cooperation can achieve higher network sum rate while reducing the delay and the required battery capacity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2633723","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7859429","startPage":"432","endPage":"442","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7859429/07762769.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Aware Power Control in Energy Cooperation Aided Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks With Renewable Energy Resources","topic":"Deployment and Management of Small Heterogeneous Cells for 5G","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762769/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762769/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy-Aware Power Control in Energy Cooperation Aided Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks With Renewable Energy Resources","publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16705813","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"5","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-Aware Power Control in Energy Cooperation Aided Millimeter Wave Cellular Networks With Renewable Energy Resources","sourcePdf":"access-xu-2633723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124714S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7859429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7859429","topics":["Deployment and Management of Small Heterogeneous Cells for 5G"],"articleId":"7762769","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7762770,"authors":[{"name":"Guohua Zhang","affiliation":["China Academy of Space Technology (Xi\u2019an), Xi\u2019an, China","Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Guohua","lastName":"Zhang","orcid":"0000-0002-9557-2444","id":"38488873600"},{"name":"Rudolf Mathar","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rudolf","lastName":"Mathar","id":"37271899400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7762770","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Phase change materials","Sparse matrices","Indexes","Simulation","Null space","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","matrix algebra","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasicyclic low-density parity-check codes","type-1 QC-LDPC codes","square matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","quasi-cyclic (QC)","circulant permutation matrix (CPM)","girth"]}],"abstract":"Given any J \u00d7 J (J > 3) square matrix over Z\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</sub>\n such that the differences of any two row vectors contain each element in Z\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">P</sub>\n at most once, a class of (3, L)-regular quasicyclic low-density parity-check codes is explicitly constructed with lengths P J L\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and girth 12, where L is any integer satisfying 3 <; L \u2264 J.

A key limitation of C-RANs is given by the capacity constraints of the fronthaul links connecting RRHs to the CU. In this letter, the impact of this architectural constraint is investigated for the fundamental functions of random access and active user equipment (UE) identification in the presence of a potentially massive number of UEs. In particular, the standard C-RAN approach based on quantize-and-forward and centralized detection is compared to a scheme based on an alternative CU-RRH functional split that enables local detection. Both techniques leverage Bayesian sparse detection. Numerical results illustrate the relative merits of the two schemes as a function of the system parameters.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2633962","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7784861/07762775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2016.2633962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7784861","startPage":"17","endPage":"21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random Access in C-RAN for User Activity Detection With Limited-Capacity Fronthaul","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762775","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/97/7784861/7762775-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Random Access in C-RAN for User Activity Detection With Limited-Capacity Fronthaul","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"24","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16561132","dateOfInsertion":"16 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762775/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"German Research Society (DFG)","grantNumber":"659/13-1"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-1525629"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004836","fundingName":"Danish Council for Independent Research"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000592","fundingName":"Fulbright Commission"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Random Access in C-RAN for User Activity Detection With Limited-Capacity Fronthaul","sourcePdf":"lsp-utkovski-2633962-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082106S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7784861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7784861","articleId":"7762775","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762781,"authors":[{"name":"Honglin Ji","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"p":["Honglin Ji received the B.S. degree in information engineering from\n the School of Electronics & Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiao Tong University, Xi'an, China, in 2014.\n He is currently working toward the M.S. degree in the Future Ready Optical Network Technology Research Group, State\n Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.\n His research interests include optical access network."]},"firstName":"Honglin","lastName":"Ji","id":"37085849469"},{"name":"Lilin Yi","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Optical Communication Systems and Networks, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"p":["Lilin Yi received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Shanghai Jiao Tong\n University (SJTU), Shanghai, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively.

We employ a single delay-interferometer (DI) to realize chirp management as well as frequency equalization to combat the chromatic dispersion during the fiber transmission and equalize the frequency response of the bandwidth-limited system. Owing to the periodical characteristic, DI can successfully manage the four downstream wavelengths simultaneously. As for the upstream transmission, a fiber Bragg grating is employed to compensate the dispersion of the four upstream channels. In addition, an optical amplification deployed at the optical line termination (OLT) is used to amplify the downstream optical power and pre-amplify the upstream signal for supporting more users. All the active and passive components except for transceivers are packaged into a single module in the OLT. The system stability is verified within 67-h real-time bit error rate measurement. We obtained a power budget of 33 dB with 0-40 km reach of standard single mode fiber based on non-return-to-zero on-off-keying modulation format for both downstream and upstream.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762781/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762781/","dateOfInsertion":"24 April 2017","publicationDate":"15 May15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16823498","volume":"35","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Field Demonstration of a Real-Time 100-Gb/s PON Based on 10G-Class Optical Devices","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61322507, 61132004 and 61575122"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Field Demonstration of a Real-Time 100-Gb/s PON Based on 10G-Class Optical Devices","sourcePdf":"jlt-yi-2633482-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133115S","chronDate":"May15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7905779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7905779","articleId":"7762781","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7762796,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Renkens","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (ESAT), Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7797574/7762796/renke-2633812-small.gif","p":["Vincent Renkens received the M.Sc.degree in electrical engineering\n from KULeuven, Leuven, Belgium, in 2014.

The user can train the system by uttering a command and subsequently demonstrating the required action through an alternative interface. From the demonstration, a bag of semantic concepts representation that represents which semantic concepts are present in the demonstration is extracted. In the previous work, we have proposed a method for learning words for these concepts by linking the bag of semantic concepts representation to a bag of features representation of the acoustics. In this method, the order in which the words occur is lost. However, in many cases, the order in which the words occur is important to be able to determine the correct action. In this paper, the vocabulary acquisition based on nonnegative matrix factorization is jointly trained with a hidden Markov model (HMM), making it possible to use the bag of concepts representation as a weak supervision for HMM learning. This model can better utilize the timing information to improve the results and the order in which the words occur is retained making it possible to learn vocabulary and grammar. The proposed system is tested on several command and control tasks and it is shown that for unimpaired speech the resulting system outperforms the system solely based on vocabulary acquisition.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language

Typically, mmW technologies for backhaul require line-of-sight conditions while high-capacity wired-based solutions need a significant investment in infrastructure. Such limitations pose practical constrains on the scalability of UDNs and increase the deployment cost of dense networks. In this paper, we consider in-band backhaul for UDNs based on massive MIMO systems in sub-6 GHz. In particular, we propose a scheme for allowing simultaneous downlink transmissions in backhaul and access network on a single frequency band that exploits a novel combination of the state-of-the-art practical transmit and receive beamforming techniques. A novel frame structure for allowing a co-existence between massive MIMO-based backhaul and UDNs is also proposed. Moreover, a solution for in-band uplink transmissions that exploits time-division-duplex (TDD) and spatial multiple-access is also provided. Extensive numerical results using a realistic system-level simulator are given. Results show that the performance of a UDN with the proposed in-band backhaul scheme reaches ~58% of the throughput of a similar access network with ideal (e.g., wired) backhaul. Our results also show that the proposed scheme provides an increase in the throughput of ~30% compared with a TDD scheme for in-band backhaul. Further advantages of the proposed massive MIMO-based in-band backhaul scheme for UDNs include reusing both the (scarce) spectrum in sub-6 GHz and acquired macro-sites, thus providing a seamless transition from LTE to 5G networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible Backhauling With Massive MIMO for Ultra-Dense Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2634039","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07762799.pdf","startPage":"9625","endPage":"9634","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2634039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762799","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762799/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","displayDocTitle":"Flexible Backhauling With Massive MIMO for Ultra-Dense Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7762799/","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16606958","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Flexible Backhauling With Massive MIMO for Ultra-Dense Networks","sourcePdf":"access-kela-2634039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077219S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7762799","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762806,"authors":[{"name":"Huan Du","affiliation":["School of Communication and Information Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China","Technology Research and Development Center for the Internet of Things, The Third Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7762806/du-2632724-small.gif","p":["Huan Du received the B.E. degree from Central China Normal University, Wuhan, China, in 2010, and the M.E. degree from Shanghai University, Shanghai, China, in 2013, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.

Three InGaAlAs/InP multiple-quantum-well RSOAs with different length are compared numerically and experimentally to reveal the existence of critical RSOA length to induce efficient modulation-cancelling effect. By using the optimal RSOA length of 1 mm, we experimentally demonstrate 2.5-Gb/s self-seeded transmission at 1550-nm wavelength over a 25-km standard single-mode fiber at both 25 and 50 \u00b0C. In addition, we demonstrate feasibility of higher-temperature (70 \u00b0C) as well as higher-bitrate (10 Gb/s) operation by employing the amplified self-seeded configuration with appropriately selected RSOAs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrayed waveguide gratings","Optical transmitters","Wavelength division multiplexing","Gain","Optical saturation","Optical fiber amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","gallium arsenide","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","optical fibre communication","optical modulation","optical transmitters","optimisation","passive optical networks","semiconductor optical amplifiers","semiconductor quantum wells","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplified self-seeded configuration","single-mode fiber","self-seeded transmission","InGaAlAs-InP multiple-quantum-well RSOA","numerical analysis","self-seeded reflective semiconductor optical amplifier","colorless WDM transmitter applications","modulation-canceling reflective semiconductor optical amplifier","optimization","size 1 mm","wavelength 1550 nm","temperature 25 degC","temperature 50 degC","temperature 70 degC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Colorless wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) transmitter","passive optical network","self-seeded reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/JLT.2016.2633719","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7852551/07762814.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7852551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2016.2633719","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of Modulation-Canceling Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifier for Colorless WDM Transmitter Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of Modulation-Canceling Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifier for Colorless WDM Transmitter Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762814/","volume":"35","issue":"2","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762814/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16669252","dateOfInsertion":"13 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of Modulation-Canceling Reflective Semiconductor Optical Amplifier for Colorless WDM Transmitter Applications","sourcePdf":"jlt-tanemura-2633719-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066297S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7852551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7852551","articleId":"7762814","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7762818,"authors":[{"name":"Alaitz Mendiola","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU, Bilbao, Spain"],"bio":{"p":["Alaitz Mendiola received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in telecommunication engineering, and the M.Sc. degree in information and communication systems and in wireless networks from the University of the Basque Country, in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

Although there are some discrepancies between the standards developing organizations working with SDN about what SDN is and how it is defined, they all outline traffic engineering (TE) as a key application. One of the most common objectives of TE is the congestion minimization, where techniques such as traffic splitting among multiple paths or advanced reservation systems are used. In such a scenario, this manuscript surveys the role of a comprehensive list of SDN protocols in TE solutions, in order to assess how these protocols can benefit TE. The SDN protocols have been categorized using the SDN architecture proposed by the open networking foundation, which differentiates among data-controller plane interfaces, application-controller plane interfaces, and management interfaces, in order to state how the interface type in which they operate influences TE. In addition, the impact of the SDN protocols on TE has been evaluated by comparing them with the path computation element (PCE)-based architecture. The PCE-based architecture has been selected to measure the impact of SDN on TE because it is the most novel TE architecture until the date, and because it already defines a set of metrics to measure the performance of TE solutions. We conclude that using the three types of interfaces simultaneously will result in more powerful and enhanced TE solutions, since they benefit TE in complementary ways.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2016.2633579","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7936707/07762818.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2016.2633579","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7936707","startPage":"918","endPage":"953","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on the Contributions of Software-Defined Networking to Traffic Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762818","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on the Contributions of Software-Defined Networking to Traffic Engineering","chronOrPublicationDate":"Secondquarter  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762818/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"30 November 2016","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Secondquarter 2017","accessionNumber":"16917930","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762818/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness","grantNumber":"TEC2013-47960-C4-3-P (S&NSEC)"},{"fundingName":"European Community s Horizon 2020 Programme","grantNumber":"691567 (GN4)"},{"fundingName":"University of the Basque Country","grantNumber":"UFI11/16"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A Survey on the Contributions of Software-Defined Networking to Traffic Engineering","sourcePdf":"comst-mendiola-2633579-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.248518S","chronDate":"Secondquarter  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7936707","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7936707","articleId":"7762818","onlineDate":"30 November 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762833,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhao","affiliation":["Information and Navigation Institute, Air Force Engineering University of CPLA, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhao","orcid":"0000-0003-2615-051X","id":"37085348166"},{"name":"Jun Gao","affiliation":["Information and Navigation Institute, Air Force Engineering University of CPLA, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Gao","id":"37279695700"},{"name":"Xiangyu Cao","affiliation":["Information and Navigation Institute, Air Force Engineering University of CPLA, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xiangyu","lastName":"Cao","id":"37085363608"},{"name":"Tao Liu","affiliation":["Information and Navigation Institute, Air Force Engineering University of CPLA, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293264900"},{"name":"Liming Xu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Electronic Information Control Laboratory, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Liming","lastName":"Xu","id":"37086010178"},{"name":"Xiao Liu","affiliation":["Information and Navigation Institute, Air Force Engineering University of CPLA, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Xiao","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085667310"},{"name":"Lili Cong","affiliation":["Information and Navigation Institute, Air Force Engineering University of CPLA, Xi\u2019an, China"],"firstName":"Lili","lastName":"Cong","id":"37085675539"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"7762833","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1528},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"A novel approach aimed at reducing the in-band radar cross section (RCS) of a waveguide slot array while maintaining its radiation performance is presented.

Both simulated and measured results show that after loading the metasurface, the in-band RCS is sufficiently reduced for both copolarized and cross-polarized incident waves while the radiation performance is well retained. The proposed method is simple, low-cost, and easily fabricated, providing a new way for in-band RCS reduction of antenna array.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7839250/07762833.pdf","startPage":"943","endPage":"947","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2633951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2633951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-Band RCS Reduction of Waveguide Slot Array Using Metasurface Bars","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflection","Antenna arrays","Bars","Antenna measurements","Metallization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microwave metamaterials","radar antennas","radar cross-sections","slot antenna arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["in-band RCS reduction","waveguide slot array","metasurface bars","radar cross section","radiation performance","anisotropic metasurface","antenna structure","energy cancelation","metal ground","copolarized incident waves","cross-polarized incident waves","antenna array"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Asymmetrical ridged waveguide slot array (ARWSA)","metasurface","radar cross section (RCS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762833/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"In-Band RCS Reduction of Waveguide Slot Array Using Metasurface Bars","volume":"65","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7762833/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16639064","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471389 and 61671464"},{"fundingName":"Doctoral Foundation of Air Force Engineering University","grantNumber":"KGD08091502"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-Band RCS Reduction of Waveguide Slot Array Using Metasurface Bars","sourcePdf":"tap-zhao-2633951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061796S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7839250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7839250","articleId":"7762833","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762835,"authors":[{"name":"Weidong Mei","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Weidong","lastName":"Mei","id":"37085390961"},{"name":"Zhi Chen","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zhi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37291476200"},{"name":"Jun Fang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Communications, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Fang","id":"37272213800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"7762835","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"abstract":"This letter studies energy efficient optimization problem for a two-receiver multiple-input single-output channel with two integrated service messages: one multicast message intended for both receivers and one confidential message intended only for one receiver and required to be perfectly secure from the other receiver.

Our general RA optimization task leads to a challenging mixed integer programming problem that is computationally intractable. We first introduce a simple and efficient clustering method to divide all the SUs into multiple groups based on their mutual interference degrees, where the SUs in different groups can share the same OFDM subchannels to improve spectrum utilization efficiency, while the SUs with heavy mutual interference cluster together in the same group and employ different subchannels to alleviate their mutual interference. Then we develop efficient radio RA algorithms to maximize the sum rate of the SUs in each cluster. A user-oriented subchannel assignment method is presented to remove the awkward integer constraints of the formulated RA problem, followed by a fast power distribution algorithm that can work out optimal solutions with an approximate linear complexity. Simulation results indicate that our proposed RA scheme can improve the throughput of the SUs significantly as compared with other methods. Moreover, our proposed RA algorithms converge stably and quickly.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2016.2633698","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7815452","startPage":"228","endPage":"237","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7815452/07762837.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clustering-Based Spectrum Sharing Strategy for Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762837/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Clustering-Based Spectrum Sharing Strategy for Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16598353","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"35","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671233"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Science Foundation","grantNumber":"BK20151389"},{"fundingName":"Open Research Fund of the National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory","grantNumber":"2016D08"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clustering-Based Spectrum Sharing Strategy for Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-wang-2633698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092084S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7815452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7815452","articleId":"7762837","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7762840,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Afana","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Canada"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Afana","orcid":"0000-0001-5253-2429","id":"38469714700"},{"name":"Salama Ikki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Canada"],"firstName":"Salama","lastName":"Ikki","id":"38262743800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7762840","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":446},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762840","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Fading channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cochannel interference","error statistics","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space shift keying MIMO systems","co-channel interference","multiple-input multiple-output space shift keying systems","average bit error probability","closed-form expression","receive antennas","transmit antennas","Rayleigh fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Space shift keying","MIMO networks","hardware impairments","system performance"]}],"abstract":"This letter provides a general analytical framework for multiple-input multiple-output space shift keying systems considering hardware impairments, at the transmitter and receiver sides, and co-channel interference.

As well, a tight upper bound ABEP expression in the general case of arbitrary number of transmit and receive antennas is obtained.

The TLC was implemented by using the DG-mode operation with highly stable eight levels: a large threshold voltage difference >9 V per level was obtained under low operating voltages at <;14 V with a fast P/E speed of 100~\u03bcs .

Correspondence estimation has long been the domain of hand-engineered features, but more recently deep learning techniques have provided powerful tools for learning features from raw data. The drawback of the latter approach is that a vast amount of (labeled, typically) training data are required for learning. This paper advocates a new approach to learning visual descriptors for dense correspondence estimation in which we harness the power of a strong three-dimensional generative model to automatically label correspondences in RGB-D video data. A fully convolutional network is trained using a contrastive loss to produce viewpoint- and lighting-invariant descriptors. As a proof of concept, we collected two datasets: The first depicts the upper torso and head of the same person in widely varied settings, and the second depicts an office as seen on multiple days with objects rearranged within. Our datasets focus on revisitation of the same objects and environments, and we show that by training the CNN only from local tracking data, our learned visual descriptor generalizes toward identifying nonlabeled correspondences across videos. We furthermore show that our approach to descriptor learning can be used to achieve state-of-the-art single-frame localization results on the MSR 7-scenes dataset without using any labels identifying correspondences between separate videos of the same scenes at training time.","doi":"10.1109/LRA.2016.2634089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2016.2634089","startPage":"420","endPage":"427","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7083369/7797562/07762851.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7797562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Supervised Visual Descriptor Learning for Dense Correspondence","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"Self-Supervised Visual Descriptor Learning for Dense Correspondence","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"2","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762851/","accessionNumber":"16561036","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762851/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Intel Science and Technology Center for Pervasive Computing"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"ONR","grantNumber":"N00014-13-1-0720"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Supervised Visual Descriptor Learning for Dense Correspondence","sourcePdf":"lra-schmidt-2634089-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090647S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7083369","isNumber":"7797562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7083369","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"7797562","articleId":"7762851","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7762852,"authors":[{"name":"Faraz Khan","affiliation":["Global Foundries, Advanced Technology Development, Malta, NY, USA","Center for Heterogeneous Integration and Performance Scaling (CHIPS), University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Faraz","lastName":"Khan","orcid":"0000-0002-2733-2684","id":"37085563881"},{"name":"Eduard Cartier","affiliation":["IBM Research, Thomas J.

creating predictive systems from electronic medical records. At present, an important missing element is detecting predictive regular clinical motifs from irregular episodic records. We present Deepr (short for Deep record), a new end-to-end deep learning system that learns to extract features from medical records and predicts future risk automatically. Deepr transforms a record into a sequence of discrete elements separated by coded time gaps and hospital transfers. On top of the sequence is a convolutional neural net that detects and combines predictive local clinical motifs to stratify the risk. Deepr permits transparent inspection and visualization of its inner working. We validate Deepr on hospital data to predict unplanned readmission after discharge. Deepr achieves superior accuracy compared to traditional techniques, detects meaningful clinical motifs, and uncovers the underlying structure of the disease and intervention space.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2016.2633963","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7839252/07762861.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2016.2633963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"$\\mathtt {Deepr}$: A Convolutional Net for Medical Records","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762861/","displayDocTitle":"$\\mathtt {Deepr}$: A Convolutional Net for Medical Records","volume":"21","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16638881","pubMedId":"27913366","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7762861/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Telstra-Deakin Centre of Excellence in Big Data and Machine Learning"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"$\\mathtt {Deepr}$: A Convolutional Net for Medical Records","sourcePdf":"jbhi-nguyen-2633963-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082922S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7839252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"7839252","articleId":"7762861","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762863,"authors":[{"name":"A-Min Yao","affiliation":["Ministerial Key Laboratory of JGMT, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7839250/7762863/yao-2633902-small.gif","p":["A-Min Yao was born in Taizhou, China, in 1989.

For the TMOFO-PCA, each phase conjugator in each channel is fed with a local oscillator signal at twice the RF frequency plus a small interelement frequency offset, resulting in the generated range-angle-dependent retrodirective beampatterns with single time-invariant maxima for each of the multiple interrogators. For the TMOFO-HBA, the multiple harmonic frequencies in a conventional time-modulated array are utilized with a common small interelement frequency offset, resulting in the simultaneous generation of range-angle-dependent harmonic beampatterns with single time-invariant maxima for each of the multiple targets.

Global stability and performance of the proposed torque control scheme are theoretically guaranteed. The current limitation of the IPMSM is easily handled without anti-windup and without degrading the torque dynamics or stability even the torque demand is beyond the maximum reachable torque. Implementation issues of the proposed control scheme to the real IPMSM plant with parameter variation are discussed. With the compensation of the linear and nonlinear inverter voltage drop, a robust and accurate torque response for the real-time MTPA operation can be achieved by an adaptive current control and online parameter estimation.

In multi-hop cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs), it becomes more challenging due to primary users' uncertain activities, varying available channels, arbitrary traffic arrivals and rate requirements, and channel interference among multiple links. In this paper, we propose a Joint Rate adaptation, Channel assignment and Routing (J-RCR) approach to maximize social welfare by optimizing the resource utility in multi-channel multi-hop CRAHNs. Our J-RCR, jointly and dynamically adjusts the data transmission rate based on network states and rate requirements, assigns interference-free channels, and selects a route when a new data flow arrives or any primary node activates. The routing mechanism in our J-RCR considers the relay workload, the distance between the relay and the destination node, and co-channel interference to primary and secondary nodes. To show the efficiency of our J-RCR, we conduct both rigorous theoretical analysis and comprehensive performance evaluations. We derive the performance bound of our J-RCR on social welfare and compare it with the ideal approach that can precisely predict future network states. Numerical results further demonstrate that our J-RCR outperforms the related solutions (e.g., Robust Route, BPR and GPSR) in terms of social welfare, average throughput, network stability, and end-to-end delay.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2633527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7894295","startPage":"2097","endPage":"2110","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7894295/07762887.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Rate Adaptation, Channel Assignment and Routing to Maximize Social Welfare in Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762887/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7762887/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Joint Rate Adaptation, Channel Assignment and Routing to Maximize Social Welfare in Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16807589","dateOfInsertion":"07 April 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"16","issue":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China Projects","grantNumber":"91438121, 61373156, 61672351 and 61532013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003816","fundingName":"Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd., Projects","grantNumber":"YBN2016090103 and YB2015080089"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Rate Adaptation, Channel Assignment and Routing to Maximize Social Welfare in Multi-Hop Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-tang-2633527-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156377S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7894295","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7894295","articleId":"7762887","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7762890,"authors":[{"name":"Dongwoon Hyun","affiliation":["Department of Bioengineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/58/7870770/7762890/hyun-2634004-small.gif","p":["Dongwoon Hyun was born in Seoul, South Korea, in 1988.

The proposed methods are implemented in simulation and in vivo studies. Reducing the kernel to a single sample improved computational throughput and improved axial resolution. Downsampling the receive aperture was found to have negligible effect on estimator variance, and improved computational throughput by an order of magnitude for a downsample factor of 4. The ensemble correlation estimator demonstrated lower variance than the currently used average correlation. Combining the three methods, the throughput was improved 105-fold in simulation with a downsample factor of 4- and 20-fold in vivo with a downsample factor of 2.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/58/7870770/07762890.pdf","startPage":"500","endPage":"513","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2634004","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2016.2634004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7870770","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Strategies for Estimating the Spatial Coherence of Backscatter","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Spatial coherence","Kernel","Estimation","Apertures","Backscatter","Acoustics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioacoustics","biomedical ultrasonics","coherence","echo","ultrasonic scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultrasound backscatter","medical imaging","scattering source","blood flow detection","spatial coherence estimation methods","reduced kernel","estimator variance","correlation estimator"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational efficiency","spatial coherence","ultrasonography"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Echocardiography","Heart","Humans","Image Processing, Computer-Assisted","Scattering, Radiation","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Strategies for Estimating the Spatial Coherence of Backscatter","volume":"64","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7762890/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16721725","pubMedId":"27913342","dateOfInsertion":"03 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000070","fundingName":"National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering","grantNumber":"R01-EB015506 and R01-EB013661"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Strategies for Estimating the Spatial Coherence of Backscatter","sourcePdf":"tuffc-hyun-2634004-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114699S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"7870770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7870770","articleId":"7762890","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762891,"authors":[{"name":"Satyajit Mohanty","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology Rourkela, Rourkela, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/7866903/7762891/mohan-2633722-small.gif","p":["Satyajit Mohanty received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in\n electrical engineering from Biju Patnaik University of Technology and Siksha O Anusandhan University, Odisha, India,\n in 2009 and 2012, respectively, and is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering at National\n Institute of Technology Rourkela.

GWO handles the initial stages of MPPT followed by application of the P&O algorithm at the final stage in view of achieving faster convergence to the global peak (GP). This MPPT thus overcomes the computational overhead as encountered in the case of a GWO-based MPPT algorithm reported earlier by Mohanty et al. The idea behind using the hybrid technique is to scale down the search space of GWO which helps to speed up for achieving convergence toward the GP. The proposed MPPT algorithm is first implemented using MATLAB/Simulink and subsequently an experimental setup is prepared for its practical implementation. From the obtained results, it is confirmed that the proposed MPPT provides superior tracking performance in any weather conditions compared to both GWO and PSO+PO-based MPPT algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TEC.2016.2633722","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel7/60/7866903/07762891.pdf","startPage":"340","endPage":"347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7866903","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEC.2016.2633722","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Grey Wolf-Assisted Perturb & Observe MPPT Algorithm for a PV System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762891","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Grey Wolf-Assisted Perturb & Observe MPPT Algorithm for a PV System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762891/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16707647","htmlLink":"/document/7762891/","volume":"32","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Grey Wolf-Assisted Perturb & Observe MPPT Algorithm for a PV System","sourcePdf":"tec-subudhi-2633722-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095791S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"60","isNumber":"7866903","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"7866903","articleId":"7762891","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7762896,"authors":[{"name":"Wei-Jie Liang","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7763897/7762896/liang-2633872-small.gif","p":["Wei-Jie Liang received the B.S. degree in mathematics from Fu-Jen Catholic University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2007, and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from National Sun Yat-sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, in 2010.

The distributed cooperative secondary control is fully distributed (i.e., uses only the information of neighboring DGs that can communicate with one another through a sparse communication network). In contrast to existing distributed methods that require a detailed model of the system (such as line impedances, loads, other DG units parameters, and even the microgrid configuration, which are practically unknown), the proposed protocols are synthesized by considering the unmodeled dynamics, unknown disturbances, and uncertainties in their models. The other novel idea in this paper is that the consensus-based distributed controllers restore the islanded microgrid's voltage magnitudes and frequency to their reference values for all DGs within finite time, irrespective of parametric uncertainties, unmodeled dynamics, and disturbances, while providing accurate real-power sharing. Moreover, the proposed method considers the coupling between the frequency and voltage of the islanded microgrid. Unlike conventional distributed controllers, the proposed approach quickly reaches consensus and exhibits a more accurate robust performance. Finally, we verify the proposed control strategy's performance using the MATLAB/SimPowerSystems toolbox.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762897/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","volume":"32","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"17121851","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762897/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Robust Finite-Time Secondary Voltage and Frequency Control of Islanded Microgrids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Robust Finite-Time Secondary Voltage and Frequency Control of Islanded Microgrids","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-mahdian-2634085-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.345814S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8012582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"8012582","articleId":"7762897","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7762898,"authors":[{"name":"Yajing Shen","affiliation":["City University of Hong Kong Shenzhen Research Institute, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Yajing","lastName":"Shen","orcid":"0000-0001-5799-7524","id":"37592885300"},{"name":"Wenfeng Wan","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Wenfeng","lastName":"Wan","id":"37085595561"},{"name":"Haojian Lu","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Haojian","lastName":"Lu","id":"37086072763"},{"name":"Toshio Fukuda","affiliation":["School of Mechatronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Toshio","lastName":"Fukuda","id":"37279174500"},{"name":"Wanfeng Shang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Xi'an University of Science and Technology, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Wanfeng","lastName":"Shang","id":"37887033400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1552-3098"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0468"}],"articleNumber":"7762898","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":29,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":689},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Robotics and Automation Society","url":"http://www.ieee-ras.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot kinematics","Scanning electron microscopy","Image edge detection","Lenses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulators","medical robotics","microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic sample alignment","novel nanorobotic manipulation system","multidirectional imaging","miniature rotation robot","forward-backward alignment strategy","microscopic imaging","microdefect detection","micromanipulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Microscopy multidirectional imaging","nanoautomation","nanomanipulation","nanorobotic manipulation system","rotation alignment"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762898","abstract":"Microscopy has been an indispensable tool for micro/nanosample imaging, manipulation, and characterization.

First, a miniature rotation robot with three degrees of freedom is designed and integrated with a microscope. Then, a forward-backward alignment strategy containing three loops, i.e., position shift loop, angle loop, and magnification loop, is proposed to align the sample to the rotation axis of the robot automatically. After that, the sample is imaged from multidirection by rotating the robot with one revolution (360\u00b0). Finally, the alignment accuracy is evaluated and multi-directional images of various samples are implemented.

By coordinating batteries' state of charge control, the behaviors of the vehicle owners and the uncertainties imposed by the changes of the batteries' state of charge are taken into consideration.

Thereby, MECO is envisioned as a promising technique for prolonging the battery lives and enhancing the computation capacities of mobiles. In this paper, we study resource allocation for a multiuser MECO system based on time-division multiple access (TDMA) and orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). First, for the TDMA MECO system with infinite or finite cloud computation capacity, the optimal resource allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem for minimizing the weighted sum mobile energy consumption under the constraint on computation latency. The optimal policy is proved to have a threshold-based structure with respect to a derived offloading priority function, which yields priorities for users according to their channel gains and local computing energy consumption. As a result, users with priorities above and below a given threshold perform complete and minimum offloading, respectively. Moreover, for the cloud with finite capacity, a sub-optimal resource-allocation algorithm is proposed to reduce the computation complexity for computing the threshold. Next, we consider the OFDMA MECO system, for which the optimal resource allocation is formulated as a mixed-integer problem. To solve this challenging problem and characterize its policy structure, a low-complexity sub-optimal algorithm is proposed by transforming the OFDMA problem to its TDMA counterpart. The corresponding resource allocation is derived by defining an average offloading priority function and shown to have close-to-optimal performance in simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","volume":"16","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"16725095","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762913/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Mobile-Edge Computation Offloading","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"LG Electronics"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Resource Allocation for Mobile-Edge Computation Offloading","sourcePdf":"twc-huang-2633522-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.182543S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"713","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7762913","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7762915,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Kasper","affiliation":["Power Electronic Systems Laboratory, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7924296/7762915/kaspe-2633334-small.gif","p":["Matthias Kasper (S\u201912) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, in 2011 and\n 2016, respectively.","During his studies, he focused on power electronics, power systems, and control of mechatronic systems.

Classification on Dermoscopy Images Using a Neural Network Ensemble Model","abstract":"We develop a novel method for classifying melanocytic tumors as benign or malignant by the analysis of digital dermoscopy images. The algorithm follows three steps: first, lesions are extracted using a self-generating neural network (SGNN); second, features descriptive of tumor color, texture and border are extracted; and third, lesion objects are classified using a classifier based on a neural network ensemble model. In clinical situations, lesions occur that are too large to be entirely contained within the dermoscopy image. To deal with this difficult presentation, new border features are proposed, which are able to effectively characterize border irregularities on both complete lesions and incomplete lesions. In our model, a network ensemble classifier is designed that combines back propagation (BP) neural networks with fuzzy neural networks to achieve improved performance. Experiments are carried out on two diverse dermoscopy databases that include images of both the xanthous and caucasian races. The results show that classification accuracy is greatly enhanced by the use of the new border features and the proposed classifier model.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762919/","volume":"36","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7762919/","accessionNumber":"16707580","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"27913337","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"01 March 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Melanoma Classification on Dermoscopy Images Using a Neural Network Ensemble Model","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471016 and 61371134"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Melanoma Classification on Dermoscopy Images Using a Neural Network Ensemble Model","sourcePdf":"tmi-xie-2633551-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092552S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7867803","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7867803","articleId":"7762919","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7762929,"authors":[{"name":"Ui-Min Choi","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7924296/7762929/choi-2633578-small.gif","p":["Ui-Min Choi (S\u201911\u2013M\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S.\n degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Ajou University, Suwon, South Korea, in 2011 and 2013,\n respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2016.","He is currently with the Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, as Postdoctoral Researcher.

Accordingly, recent research makes an effort to improve the reliability of power electronic systems to comply with more stringent constraints on safety, cost, and availability. The power devices are one of the most reliability-critical components in power electronic systems. Therefore, its condition monitoring plays an important role to improve the reliability of power electronic systems. This paper proposes a condition monitoring method of insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) modules. In the first section of this paper, a structure of a conventional IGBT module and a related parameter for the condition monitoring are explained. Then, a proposed real-time on-state collector-emitter voltage measurement circuit and condition monitoring strategies under different operating conditions are described.

Each nonlinear subsystem in the considered large-scale system is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno model, and exchanges its information through a digital channel. We propose an event-triggering mechanism, which determines when the premise variables and system states should be transmitted to the controller. Our goal is to design a decentralized event-triggered state-feedback fuzzy controller, such that the resulting closed-loop fuzzy control system is asymptotically stable while the measured information is transmitted to the controller as little as possible. By using the input delay and perturbed system approaches, the closed-loop sampled-data fuzzy system with event-triggered control is first reformulated into a continuous-time system with time-varying delay and extra disturbance. Then, based on the new model, we introduce a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional with virtue of Wirtinger's inequality, where not all of the Lyapunov matrices are required to be positive definite. The codesign result is derived to obtain simultaneously the controller gains, sampled period, network delay, and event-triggered parameter in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to validate the advantage of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2634090","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8278217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TFUZZ.2016.2634090","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/91/8278217/07762939.pdf","startPage":"29","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized Event-Triggered Control for Large-Scale Networked Fuzzy Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762939/","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized Event-Triggered Control for Large-Scale Networked Fuzzy Systems","volume":"26","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"17541863","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7762939/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council","grantNumber":"NSC98-2221-E-155-059-MY3"},{"fundingName":"Advanced Research Project of XMUT","grantNumber":"YKJ16008R"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China","grantNumber":"2017J0106 and 2016J01267"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Decentralized Event-Triggered Control for Large-Scale Networked Fuzzy Systems","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-lin-2634090-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084869S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"8278217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8278217","articleId":"7762939","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7762949,"authors":[{"name":"Chin-Fu Nien","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7924296/7762949/nien-2633760-small.gif","p":["Chin-Fu Nien was born in Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1992.

However, the series operation of IGBTs is not easy due to the unbalanced voltage sharing between them, especially during the switching transients and the tail-current period. In this paper, a hybrid active gate drive is presented for both switching loss reduction and voltage balancing of the series-connected IGBTs. Compared with the conventional gate drive, the proposed method allows dynamical adjustment of the switching speed of IGBTs; thus the switching loss can be suppressed without increasing the current and voltage stresses of the power device. For series connection, the transient voltage sharing is achieved by using an adaptive control method, while the voltage balancing during the tail-current period is optimized by a low-loss snubber circuit. The performance of the proposed hybrid active gate drive and control method has been validated by experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Active Gate Drive for Switching Loss Reduction and Voltage Balancing of Series-Connected IGBTs","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2016.2633658","startPage":"7469","endPage":"7481","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2016.2633658","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7924296","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7924296/07762950.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762950/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Active Gate Drive for Switching Loss Reduction and Voltage Balancing of Series-Connected IGBTs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"32","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7762950/","dateOfInsertion":"10 May 2017","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","accessionNumber":"16880318","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program (973 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2015CB251001 and 2015CB251004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Active Gate Drive for Switching Loss Reduction and Voltage Balancing of Series-Connected IGBTs","sourcePdf":"tpel-yang-2633658-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076396S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7924296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7924296","articleId":"7762950","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762951,"authors":[{"name":"Yifei Mu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K."],"firstName":"Yifei","lastName":"Mu","id":"37085360379"},{"name":"Ce Zhou Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Ce Zhou","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37074322600"},{"name":"Qifeng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K."],"firstName":"Qifeng","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085849742"},{"name":"Chun Zhao","affiliation":["Nano and Advanced Materials Institute, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chun","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37573726900"},{"name":"Yanfei Qi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Yanfei","lastName":"Qi","id":"37085862010"},{"name":"Sang Lam","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Xi\u2019an Jiaotong-Liverpool University, Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Sang","lastName":"Lam","id":"37086191575"},{"name":"Ivona Z.

High required charging rates lead to high power demands, which may not be supported by the grid. In this paper, an optimal power flow technique of a PV-battery powered fast EV charging station is presented to continuously minimize the operation cost. The objective is to help the penetration of PV-battery systems into the grid and to support the growing need of fast EV charging. An optimization problem is formulated along with the required constraints and the operating cost function is chosen as a combination of electricity grid prices and the battery degradation cost. In the first stage of the proposed optimization procedure, an offline particle swarm optimization (PSO) is performed as a prediction layer. In the second stage, dynamic programming (DP) is performed as an online reactive management layer. Forecasted system data is utilized in both stages to find the optimal power management solution. In the reactive management layer, the outputs of the PSO are used to limit the available state trajectories used in the DP and, accordingly, improve the system computation time and efficiency. Online error compensation is implemented into the DP and fed back to the prediction layer for necessary prediction adjustments. Simulation and 1 kW prototype experimental results are successfully implemented to validate the system effectiveness and to demonstrate the benefits of using a hybrid grid tied system of PV-battery for fast EVs charging stations.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2016.2633526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/7880726/07762955.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2016.2633526","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7880726","startPage":"1347","endPage":"1357","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power Flow Management of a Grid Tied PV-Battery System for Electric Vehicles Charging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7762955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power Flow Management of a Grid Tied PV-Battery System for Electric Vehicles Charging","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7762955/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 2017","accessionNumber":"16756551","dateOfInsertion":"17 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7762955/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power Flow Management of a Grid Tied PV-Battery System for Electric Vehicles Charging","sourcePdf":"tia-sozer-2633526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060298S","chronDate":"March-April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7880726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"7880726","articleId":"7762955","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7762957,"authors":[{"name":"Jinpeng Yu","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Qingdao University, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/8278217/7762957/yu2634162-small.gif","p":["Jinpeng Yu received the B.Sc. degree in automation from Qingdao\n University, Qingdao, China, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree in system engineering from Shandong University, Jinan, China, in\n 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in system theory from the Institute of Complexity Science, Qingdao University, in 2011.","He is currently a Distinguished Professor with the School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, Qingdao\n University.

In FEC channel coding, the OFDM based wireless communication system incorporates a convolutional encoder under various digital modulation schemes (QAM, QPSK, 8QAM, 8PSK, 16QAM, 16PSK, 32QAM and 32PSK). The computer simulation results on BER over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and other fading (Rayleigh and Rician) channels demonstrate that the convolutional encoded OFDM system outperforms with QAM modulation technique as compared to other digital modulation schemes and the system is highly effective to combat inherent interferences under Rayleigh and Rician fading channels. It has been anticipated from the simulation study with synthetically generated data that the performance of the communication system degrades with the increasing of noise power.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 57th International Scientific Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering of Riga Technical University (RTUCON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7753451/7763053/07763109.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 57th International Scientific Conference on Power and Electrical Engineering of Riga Technical University (RTUCON)","doi":"10.1109/RTUCON.2016.7763109","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTUCON.2016.7763109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763053","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bit error rate performance analysis of convolutional coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Frequency division multiplexing","Fading channels","Receivers","Frequency modulation","Convolutional codes","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel coding","convolutional codes","error statistics","forward error correction","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","Rician channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bit error rate performance analysis","convolutional coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","OFDM","wireless communication system","BER","FEC channel coding","digital modulation scheme","8QAM","8PSK","16QAM","16PSK","32QAM","32PSK","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN","Rayleigh fading channel","Rician fading channel","interference"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BER","OFDM","Convolutional encoder","A WGN","QAM","Rayleigh fading","Rician fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Bit error rate performance analysis of convolutional coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763109/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16522265","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2016","conferenceDate":"13-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bit error rate performance analysis of convolutional coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing system","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"RTUCON2016042PID4562983.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053036S","chronDate":"13-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7753451","isNumber":"7763053","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7753451","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7763053","articleId":"7763109","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763158,"authors":[{"name":"Lev Rassudov","affiliation":["Department of Electric Drives, Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Lev","lastName":"Rassudov","id":"37085425785"},{"name":"Alexandre Balkovoi","affiliation":["Department of Electric Drives, Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Alexandre","lastName":"Balkovoi","id":"37085406390"},{"name":"Alecksey Anuchin","affiliation":["Department of Electric Drives, Moscow Power Engineering Institute, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Alecksey","lastName":"Anuchin","id":"37085364726"},{"name":"Igor Gulyaev","affiliation":["Electronics and nanoelectronics Department, Ogarev Mordova State University, Saransk, Russia"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Gulyaev","id":"37661974600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3731-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3730-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3732-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763158","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"abstract":"The wide range of modern industrial applications demand on extremely high performance of motion control systems in terms of tracking accuracy and therefore control bandwidth.

The number of drones can be significantly reduced (up to 64%) by using a more advanced type of drone, by decreasing the user coverage requirement (11% less drones when requiring 80% instead of 90%) or by increasing the fly height of the drones (about 10% less drones needed when increasing the fly height by 10 m).

We provide the optimal power allocation and optimal precoding designs with respect to the estimated channel and MMSE. The designs introduced are optimal for multiple access (MAC) Gaussian coherent time-varying fading channels with general inputs and can be specialized to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channels by decoding interference. The impact of interference on the capacity is quantified by the gradient of the mutual information with respect to the power, channel, and error and covariance of the interferer. We provide two novel distributed MCP algorithms that provide the solutions for the optimal power allocation and optimal precoding for the UL and DL with a two way channel estimation to keep track on the channel variation over blocks of data transmission.

To this end, advanced cluster-based multiple-antenna techniques such as network MIMO (N-MIMO) or large-scale MIMO (LS-MIMO) are considered for the physical layer of the system. The framework is general enough to be able to cater for different forms of power allocation, rate allocation or scheduling policy while providing critical performance metrics such as throughput or fairness measures while being able to incorporate per-cluster as well as per-BS power constraints. Remarkably, different greedy scheduling algorithms are proposed for both N-MIMO and LS-MIMO that are able to significantly exploit the multiuser and frequency diversity of the system while remaining computationally feasible. A particularly interesting application of the proposed framework, explored in detail in this paper, is a thorough and realistic comparison of the performance of N-MIMO and LS-MIMO that reveals the strengths and weaknesses of each strategy in terms of throughput and fairness.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763197.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763197","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763197","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763197","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On scheduling and resource allocation in cluster-based cooperative MIMO-OFDMA cellular networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Resource management","Antennas","5G mobile communication","Downlink","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","cluster-based cooperative MIMO-OFDMA cellular networks","cross-layer framework","scheduling","heterogeneous traffic","power allocation","rate allocation","multiuser diversity","frequency diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"On scheduling and resource allocation in cluster-based cooperative MIMO-OFDMA cellular networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763197/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519718","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On scheduling and resource allocation in cluster-based cooperative MIMO-OFDMA cellular networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p183rierapalou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066505S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763199,"authors":[{"name":"Shabnam Khomejani","affiliation":["King's College, Center for Telecommunications Research, London"],"firstName":"Shabnam","lastName":"Khomejani","id":"37547437100"},{"name":"Huan X.

Spectrum adaptation and spectrum leasing are used jointly with spectrum handoff, call buffering, and preemptive priority mechanisms to improve system performance. Two different spectrum leasing strategies are proposed and evaluated. Service differentiation between real-time and elastic (data) traffic is considered according to their different delay tolerance characteristics. For given quality of service (QoS) requirements, the Erlang capacity as a function of the maximum allowable number of simultaneously rented resources is evaluated. Additionally, the fraction of time that rented resources are needed is calculated. This quantity is used to estimate the cost of spectrum leasing per capacity Erlang. Numerical results demonstrate that resource leasing is an effective strategy to drastically improve system capacity and avoids the existence of the critical utilization factor of the primary resources (i.e., value of the primary resource utilization factor from which it is no longer possible to guarantee QoS in CRNs). Finally, by prioritizing the use of rented resources for service requests with stringent delay requirement, the cost for spectrum lease can be minimized.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763200","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763200.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of spectrum adaptation and spectrum leasing in heterogeneous traffic cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763200/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7763200/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of spectrum adaptation and spectrum leasing in heterogeneous traffic cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519644","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of spectrum adaptation and spectrum leasing in heterogeneous traffic cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p207ramirezreyna.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089978S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763200","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7763204,"authors":[{"name":"Bilel Raddadi","affiliation":["INPT, University of Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Bilel","lastName":"Raddadi","id":"37085592319"},{"name":"Nathalie Thomas","affiliation":["INPT, University of Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Nathalie","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37687019400"},{"name":"Charly Poulliat","affiliation":["INPT, University of Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Charly","lastName":"Poulliat","id":"37269105300"},{"name":"Marie-Laure Boucheret","affiliation":["INPT, University of Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Marie-Laure","lastName":"Boucheret","id":"38491572500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0724-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0725-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763204","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Modulation","Frequency-domain analysis","Channel estimation","Peak to average power ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","channel estimation","fast Fourier transforms","inverse transforms","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial modulation","aeronautical communications","single-carrier orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","spectrally shaped SC-SC-OFDM","SS SC-OFDM","frequency window","inverse fast Fourier transform","IFFT","time domain generated waveform","peak-to-average power ratio","PAPR","multicarrier systems","reduced-rank least square channel estimation","LS channel estimation","minimum mean square error","MMSE equalization","information bits"]}],"abstract":"In this work, we apply Spatial Modulation (SM) to in the so-called spectrally shaped SC-OFDM (SS SC-OFDM) at the transmitter.

At the receiver, a reduced-rank (rr) Least Square (LS) channel estimation and a combining Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) equalization are used to retrieve the transmitted block of information bits, considering two flight scenarios for different environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of spatial modulation in aeronautical communications","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763204","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763204.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763204","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763204","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763204/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"On the use of spatial modulation in aeronautical communications","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763204/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519642","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of spatial modulation in aeronautical communications","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p237raddadi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0685S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763204","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763213,"authors":[{"name":"Pierre Neumann","affiliation":["ICube laboratory (CNRS), University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Neumann","id":"37086161803"},{"name":"Julien Montavont","affiliation":["ICube laboratory (CNRS), University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Montavont","id":"37697693600"},{"name":"Thomas No\u00ebl","affiliation":["ICube laboratory (CNRS), University of Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"No\u00ebl","id":"37275183000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0724-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0725-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763213","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":73,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":3624},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Wireless communication","Network servers","5G mobile communication","Performance evaluation","Protocols","Frequency shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","indoor radio","Internet of Things","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power wide area network indoor deployment","LoRaWAN case study","LPWAN","Internet of Things paradigm","wireless communication network","multihop wireless networks","5G network","indoor environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LoRaWAN","LPWAN","Internet of Things","Experimental Study"]}],"abstract":"The last decade saw the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, which aims to connect any object to the Internet.

In this network with half-duplex MIMO relays, the wireless medium is simultaneously utilized for time-slotted transmissions by one of the users and one of the relays in order to increase the network capacity. The relays successively relay the signals creating inter-relay interference (IRI), which limits the bit error rate (BER) performance. To mitigate the IRI, this paper develops a cancellation technique at the receiving side of the users through specialized signal processing and scheduling of transmissions with opportunistic listening. The full IRI cancellation is possible assuming that every transceiver knows its receiving channel state information (CSI) and the inter-relay CSI. When all nodes - users and relays - are equipped with M antennas, the proposed scheme allows to exchange M messages per time slot which doubles the capacity of the network over the conventional AF system operating with a single relay in one-way setup. Simulation results document the effectiveness of the developed scheme in terms of channel capacity and the BER performance.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763219","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763219.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Increasing throughput in multi-way three-user MIMO networks using successive relaying and IRI cancellation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763219/","displayDocTitle":"Increasing throughput in multi-way three-user MIMO networks using successive relaying and IRI cancellation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519705","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763219/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing throughput in multi-way three-user MIMO networks using successive relaying and IRI cancellation","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p354alhumaidi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068798S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763220,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The use of massive MIMO base stations and heterogeneous networks offers an increase in throughput without increasing the bandwidth, but with reduced power consumption. This makes the two technologies very attractive for future wireless mobile communication systems. We investigate the optimization problem of maximizing the data rate whilst mitigating inter-tier interference for macrocell users in a typical heterogeneous network. We present a first-order solution for maximizing the weighted sum rate of the macrocell users. The proposed method uses the matrix stuffing technique and the alternative direction method of multipliers to efficiently transform and solve the optimization problem, respectively. Simulation results of a single-cell heterogeneous network show that the solution gives near-optimal performance, which is achieved by state-of-the-art modelling languages and second-order solvers for an increased number of antennas at the macrocell base station. The proposed method converges much faster than the interior-point methods, which makes it attractive for practical implementation.","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763220","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763220.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast convergence for efficient beamforming in massive MIMO heterogeneous networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763220","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763220/","displayDocTitle":"Fast convergence for efficient beamforming in massive MIMO heterogeneous networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519728","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763220/","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast convergence for efficient beamforming in massive MIMO heterogeneous networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p359sande.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10667S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763221,"authors":[{"name":"Xueying Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"],"firstName":"Xueying","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085827309"},{"name":"Zichao Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"],"firstName":"Zichao","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085827353"},{"name":"Jacek Ilow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada"],"firstName":"Jacek","lastName":"Ilow","id":"37280038500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0724-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0725-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763221","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","MIMO","Precoding","Antennas","Decoding","Wireless communication","Three-dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","decoding","error statistics","iterative methods","MIMO communication","optimisation","precoding","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication scheduling","telecommunication signalling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal signal space alignment","multiple input multiple output Y channel","relay","redundant antenna configuration","MIMO Y channel system","symbol error rate performance","precoding vector","orthogonal signaling dimension selection","decoding","bit error rate performance improvement","BER performance improvement","power allocation","iterative optimization","transmissions time scheduling"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we design a signal alignment scheme that exploits orthogonality of spatial signalling dimensions in the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Y channel, where three users send messages to each other through a relay.

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a practical end-to-end occupancy inference system, which requires minimum user effort, and is able to infer room-level occupancy accurately with commodity WiFi infrastructure. Depending on the needs of different occupancy information subscribers, our system is flexible enough to switch between snapshot estimation mode and continuous inference mode, to trade estimation accuracy for delay and communication cost.

The cornerstone of CR is spectrum occupancy prediction that enables agile and proactive spectrum access and efficient utilization of spectral resources. Hidden Markov Models (HMM) provide powerful and flexible tools for statistical spectrum prediction. In this paper we introduce a HMM-based spectrum prediction algorithm for industrial applications that accurately predicts multiple slots in the future. Traditional HMM prediction approaches use two hidden states enabling the prediction of only one step ahead in the future. This one step is most often not enough due to internal hardware delays that render it outdated. We show in this work that extending the number of hidden states and formulating the prediction problem as a maximum likelihood (ML) classification approach enables a prediction span of multiple slots in the future even with fine spectrum sensing resolution. We verify the suitability of our approach to industrial wireless through extensive simulations that utilize a realistic measurement-based traffic model specifically tailored for industrial automotive settings.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum prediction using hidden Markov models for industrial cognitive radio","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763231","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763231.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763231","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum prediction using hidden Markov models for industrial cognitive radio","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763231/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519694","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum prediction using hidden Markov models for industrial cognitive radio","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p448saad.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078849S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763232,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Effective SDN based traffic engineering using OpenFlow, particularly in campus networking however, requires sophisticated real-time user traffic visualization solution having minimum management overhead. To address the intuitive monitoring gaps in existing campus based SDN, the present paper proposes profiling campus user traffic to visualize real-time network workload and accurately provision resources. The design solely utilizes existing OpenFlow traffic measurements, subjected to k-means clustering to segregate users into different traffic classes (profiles) based on their application trends. To validate design feasibility, the present study derived six unique user traffic profiles from OpenFlow generated traffic statistics of a realistic campus switch over a two-week time frame. The derived profiles represented significant discrimination among user application trends and were further benchmarked for high stability (96.1-99.1%), to ascertain their viability for monitoring purposes. Additional simulation tests at varying user loads attributed minimum computational cost and low OpenFlow control overhead (4.02-4.96%) to the proposed approach, offering high scalability for real-time network monitoring and resource provisioning.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763235","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763235.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OpenFlow-enabled user traffic profiling in campus software defined networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"OpenFlow-enabled user traffic profiling in campus software defined networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7763235/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519667","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763235/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OpenFlow-enabled user traffic profiling in campus software defined networks","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p475bakhshi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05154S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763235","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7763240,"authors":[{"name":"Khashayar Kotobi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Khashayar","lastName":"Kotobi","id":"37085687532"},{"name":"Philip B.

The bandwidth under consideration may be either in an unlicensed spectrum or in an unused licensed band. Spectrum sharing is achieved via a mechanism in which a cognitive radio acting as the auctioneer advertises spectrum availability to bidding cognitive radios and defines a puzzle to solve as a method to access it. The cognitive radios act as bidders by computing the solution to the problem (i.e., the \u201cpuzzle\u201d). The winner is the bidder who submits the first correct bid and thus gains access to the spectrum for the next time interval. We consider two different variances of our scheme based on parallelizable and non-parallelizable problems and demonstrate that the latter provides a fair auction in contrast to the former. We propose a verification database to counter malicious \u201cgreedy\u201d players.

To sustain these networks, the literature describes methods such as Epidemic and Spray&Wait, which do not learn from the network behaviour, and Gossiping-based algorithms that collect historical network data to improve efficiency. In this paper, we show that Gossiping-based solutions suffer from pathological behaviour in some simple network scenarios. Under certain conditions almost all the data transmitted by some nodes may get lost in the network, not reaching its destination. To address this problem we have proposed an algorithm that responds in a more robust manner while staying relatively simple. In this work, we show that our algorithm achieves delivery rates comparable to gossiping-based algorithms, while being more robust and providing better fairness. To illustrate this result, we test native implementations of our solution, Path Sampling, and related algorithms on a network simulator.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763244","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763244.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763244","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Path sampling, a robust alternative to gossiping for opportunistic network routing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Path sampling, a robust alternative to gossiping for opportunistic network routing","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7763244/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519674","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763244/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Path sampling, a robust alternative to gossiping for opportunistic network routing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p538visca.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05687S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763244","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7763254,"authors":[{"name":"Yuto Hama","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuto","lastName":"Hama","id":"37086031343"},{"name":"Hideki Ochiai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideki","lastName":"Ochiai","id":"37269532900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0724-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0725-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763254","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":301},"abstract":"With a large number of antennas at the transmitter and receiver, massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems can achieve substantially high spectral efficiency as well as high stability and reliability. Nevertheless, one of the major challenges for its practical use is its computational complexity for symbol detection that grows exponentially with the number of antennas. In this work, we focus on a low complexity implementation of massive MIMO detector based on matched filter (MF) detection with parallel interference cancellation (PIC). In general, MF-based detector performs poorly in the high SNR region. Nevertheless, with the help of powerful channel coding such as low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and the well-designed PIC, the resulting error performance of the proposed MF-PIC can approach or even outperform the conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based detector with much less complexity. Furthermore, due to its parallel structure, low latency implementation based on parallel architecture is possible and thus is suitable for practical massive MIMO systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763254.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity matched filter detector with parallel interference cancellation for massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Detectors","Complexity theory","Signal to noise ratio","Interference cancellation","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","interference suppression","matched filters","mean square error methods","MIMO communication","multiuser detection","parity check codes","receiving antennas","telecommunication network reliability","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matched filter detector","parallel interference cancellation","MF-PIC","massive multiple-input multiple-output systems","massive MIMO systems","transmitter antennas","receiver antennas","symbol detection","massive MIMO detector","SNR region","channel coding","low-density parity-check codes","LDPC codes","minimum mean square error based detector","MMSE based detector"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity matched filter detector with parallel interference cancellation for massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763254/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519643","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity matched filter detector with parallel interference cancellation for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p613hama.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043363S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763256,"authors":[{"name":"Hanan Al-Tous","affiliation":["College of Engineering, UAE University, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Hanan","lastName":"Al-Tous","id":"38469509600"},{"name":"Imad Barhumi","affiliation":["College of Engineering, UAE University, Al Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Imad","lastName":"Barhumi","id":"38480400700"},{"name":"Naofal Al-Dhahir","affiliation":["Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, USA"],"firstName":"Naofal","lastName":"Al-Dhahir","id":"37269044000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0724-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0725-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763256","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Relays","Wireless communication","Interference","Frequency-domain analysis","Standards","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","cooperative communication","OFDM modulation","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrow-band interference mitigation","compressive sensing","AF-OFDM systems","amplify-and-forward orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing","cooperative communication systems","sparse signal","structured-dictionary-mismatch formulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","AF cooperative communications","NBI","frequency-grid mismatch","compressive sensing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, narrow-band interference (NBI) mitigation is addressed in amplify-and-forward orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (AF-OFDM) cooperative communication systems. Based on the channel gains between the interferer, destination and the relay nodes, three copies of the NBI are received at the destination node in addition to the desired signal. Hence, NBI degrades the performance of AF-OFDM systems which motivates the need for mitigation techniques to reduce its effect. NBI is a sparse signal in the frequency-domain, hence, compressive sensing (CS) framework can be used to estimate and cancel the NBI before detecting the transmitted signal. However, frequency-grid-mismatch destroys the sparsity of NBI in the frequency domain at the destination terminal. A structured-dictionary-mismatch formulation is proposed to approximate the received NBI vector by two sparse vectors. An \u00a32,1 norm minimization problem is solved to recover the sparse vectors. The recovered NBI is then canceled from the received signal before detection. Simulation results demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Narrow-band interference mitigation using compressive sensing in AF-OFDM systems","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763256","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763256.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763256","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Narrow-band interference mitigation using compressive sensing in AF-OFDM systems","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763256/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519717","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Narrow-band interference mitigation using compressive sensing in AF-OFDM systems","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p624altous.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123356S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763264,"authors":[{"name":"Samir Dawaliby","affiliation":["University of Poitiers, XLIM Laboratory, Poitiers, France"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Dawaliby","id":"37086178967"},{"name":"Abbas Bradai","affiliation":["University of Poitiers, XLIM Laboratory, Poitiers, France"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Bradai","id":"38059630300"},{"name":"Yannis Pousset","affiliation":["University of Poitiers, XLIM Laboratory, Poitiers, France"],"firstName":"Yannis","lastName":"Pousset","id":"37303156800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0724-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0725-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763264","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1106},"abstract":"The Internet of Things (IoT) represents the next wave in networking and communication which will bring by 2020 tens of billions of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) devices connected through the internet.

LTE-M is one of the candidates to support M2M communications in Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular networks. In this paper, we appraise and present an in depth performance evaluation of LTE-M based on cross-layer network metrics. Compared with LTE Category 0 previously released by 3GPP for MTC, simulation results show that LTE-M offers additional advantages to meet M2M communication needs in terms of wider coverage, lower throughput, and a larger number of machines connected through LTE network. However, we show that LTE-M is not yet up to the level to meet future applications requirements regarding a near-zero latency and an advanced Quality of Service (QoS) for this massive number of

wireless sensor networks through adaptive sampling rate","abstract":"In a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) Nodes are distributed to monitor an area of interest such as a military battlefield, and transmit their data to in-situ Base-Station (BS) through multi-hop paths. In addition to collecting and processing the sensor data, the BS performs network management tasks. Due to such an important role, an adversary would try to locate the BS and target it with Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack in order to disrupt the WSN operation. Locating the BS can be done by intercepting transmissions and then employing traffic analysis techniques such as Evidence Theory (ET). To counter such an attack, this paper presents a novel technique for increasing BS anonymity by establishing a sleep/active schedule among the nodes that are far away from the BS, and increasing the traffic density in selected parts of the network in order to give the impression that the BS is located in the vicinity of the sleeping nodes. The simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique in increasing the anonymity of the BS.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763265/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7763265/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519655","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Increasing base-station anonymity in wireless sensor networks through adaptive sampling rate","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Increasing base-station anonymity in wireless sensor networks through adaptive sampling rate","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"p690alsemairi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058344S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750933","isNumber":"7762962","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750933","xplore-issue":"7762962","articleId":"7763265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763266,"authors":[{"name":"Luqiao Zhang","affiliation":["School of Network Engineering, Chengdu University of Information Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Luqiao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086109696"},{"name":"Ozgur Oksuz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Oksuz","id":"37086078161"},{"name":"Levon Nazaryan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Levon","lastName":"Nazaryan","id":"37397634700"},{"name":"Chaoqun Yue","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Chaoqun","lastName":"Yue","id":"37086083950"},{"name":"Bing Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Wang","id":"37067830900"},{"name":"Aggelos Kiayias","affiliation":["National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Aggelos","lastName":"Kiayias","id":"37545427800"},{"name":"Athanasios Bamis","affiliation":["Seldera LLC."],"firstName":"Athanasios","lastName":"Bamis","id":"37845962500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0724-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-0725-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763266","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Databases","Privacy","Encryption","Data privacy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["building management systems","cryptography","radio networks","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless network traces encrypting","user privacy protection","smart campus","encryption based approach","encryption schemes","security","smart campus prototype"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["privacy","smart campus","wireless network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763266","doi":"10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WiMOB.2016.7763266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7762962","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE 12th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750933/7762962/07763266.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encrypting wireless network traces to protect user privacy: A case study for smart campus","abstract":"Wireless network traces have been widely used to understand human behaviors and provide value-added services. Sanitization based techniques have been shown to be severely lacking in protecting sensitive user information embedded in such traces. In this paper, we take an encryption based approach that provides much stronger protection of user privacy. One challenge in encrypting wireless network traces is how to encrypt time range while maintaining the utility of the traces. We propose two practical encryption techniques to support queries that involve time range. These two techniques provide much stronger security guarantee than existing order preserving encryption schemes, and present different tradeoffs in complexity, as well as storage and network bandwidth requirement.

By running on the commercial LTE based test-bed, we can show that the system works properly and gives us about 58 percent local breakout ratio.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763283","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763283.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"743","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763283","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763283","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local breakout of mobile access network traffic by mobile edge computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763283/","displayDocTitle":"Local breakout of mobile access network traffic by mobile edge computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763283/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519907","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local breakout of mobile access network traffic by mobile edge computing","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P18.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03557S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763284,"authors":[{"name":"Uooyeol Yoon","affiliation":["KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), Daejeon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Uooyeol","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37086002935"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763284","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":411},"abstract":"As the MIMO processing gets popular in LTE wireless mobile communication, the number of RF chains of base station for MIMO processing gets increased, which results in the increase of cost and the volume of eNodeB base-station. In order to solve this problem, the beamspace MIMO RF Antenna has been proposed. The advantage of Beam-space MIMO RF Antenna is to reduce the RF chain which results in the cost reduction of LTE RF module. For implementing Beam-space MIMO, six-port modulator RF has been proposed with the concept of impedance loading. In order to support impedance loading based on six-port modulator, the LTE IQ baseband signal from LTE modem should be transformed to control the six-port modulator RF chip. This transformation is performed by table mapping at FPGA in this design. The requirement of baseband processing is 300Mbps in 33MHz band which supports 4 streams. The integration system has been designed with LTE modem that supports 4\u00d74 MIMO. The testing of full integration system consists of baseband FPGA, LTE modem and Beam-space MIMO RF Antenna module. LTE signal generator, commercial LTE test platform have been used to validate the design of beamspace MIMO RF baseband system during the test procedure.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International

Recently, ConvNets (Convolutional Neural Networks)-based YOLO model is a successful method applied for object (including human) detection. It is one of the fastest way to detect directly objects from the input image. However, compared to the ConvNets-based state-of-the-art object detection methods, YOLO model-based object detection method achieved less accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new real-time human detection under fisheye cameras for surveillance purpose based on YOLO model. However, we improve the preciseness by using 2-D input channels consisting of grey-level image channel and foreground-background context information extracted by AGMM (Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model) instead of original 3-D color input channels for ConvNets-based YOLO model. It is shown through experiments that the proposed method performs better with respect to accuracy and more robust to background scene changes without processing speed degradation compared to YOLO model-based human detection so that it can be successfully employed for embedded surveillance application.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763311","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763311.pdf","startPage":"840","endPage":"845","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ConvNets and AGMM based real-time human detection under fisheye camera for embedded surveillance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763311/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"ConvNets and AGMM based real-time human detection under fisheye camera for embedded surveillance","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16519864","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7763311/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ConvNets and AGMM based real-time human detection under fisheye camera for embedded surveillance","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P136.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055275S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7763320,"authors":[{"name":"Seungyeob Chae","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seungyeob","lastName":"Chae","id":"37086107846"},{"name":"Sujin Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sujin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086104558"},{"name":"Sangjin Cho","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangjin","lastName":"Cho","id":"37086102485"},{"name":"Minjoong Rim","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Minjoong","lastName":"Rim","id":"37302119800"},{"name":"Chung G.

MTC devices may be placed in indoor or underground environments, where the signal is hard to reach. In order to maintain a proper communication range, devices with bad channel conditions may use very low data rates using data repetitions. However, the performance of devices with long packet lengths may be degraded due to increased collisions with other short packets. In this paper, we propose random access schemes using orthogonal data repetition patterns to reduce the collision probability of devices with bad channel conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance evaluation","Base stations","Next generation networking","Wireless communication","Mobile communication","Delays","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["indoor radio","mobile communication","next generation networks","probability","random processes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal data repetition patterns","next generation wireless communication system","next generation mobile communication system","machine type communication devices","MTC devices","indoor environments","underground environments","communication range","bad channel conditions","packet lengths","random access schemes","collision probability reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["internet of things","massive connectivity","random access","machine type communication","repetition pattern"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763320","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763320.pdf","startPage":"877","endPage":"881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763320","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Orthogonal data repetition patterns for massive connectivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763320","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Orthogonal data repetition patterns for massive connectivity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763320/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763320/","accessionNumber":"16519847","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Orthogonal data repetition patterns for massive connectivity","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P145.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046076S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7763321,"authors":[{"name":"Seungyeob Chae","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Seungyeob","lastName":"Chae","id":"37086107846"},{"name":"Sangjin Cho","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangjin","lastName":"Cho","id":"37086102485"},{"name":"Sujin Kim","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sujin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086104558"},{"name":"Minjoong Rim","affiliation":["Dept. of Information and Communication Engineering, Dongguk University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Minjoong","lastName":"Rim","id":"37302119800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763321","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":310},"abstract":"One of the major requirements for next generation mobile or wireless communication systems is to efficiently support a large number of machine type communication (MTC) devices for internet-of-things (IoT) applications. For IoT services, a base station needs to receive packets with very low receive sensitivity since many MTC devices are placed inside buildings or underground while the transmission power of MTC devices is usually low. In order to maintain a wide coverage area, MTC devices with very bad channel conditions need to transmit with low data rates, i.e., with long packet lengths compared to others in good conditions. In this paper, we discuss the performance improvement of random access using a coded random access technique when MTC devices use different packet lengths according to their channel conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Things","mobile radio","next generation networks","packet radio networks","random codes","telecommunication services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["massive machine type communication","coded random access","multiple coverage class","next generation mobile communication systems","wireless communication systems","Internet-of-Things","IoT services","base station","transmission power","channel conditions","packet lengths"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["machine type communication","internet of things","random access","coverage class","coded random access"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763321","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763321.pdf","startPage":"882","endPage":"886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763321","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded random access with multiple coverage classes for massive machine type communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763321","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coded random access with multiple coverage classes for massive machine type communication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763321/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7763321/","accessionNumber":"16573449","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded random access with multiple coverage classes for massive machine type communication","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049098S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763321","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7763339,"authors":[{"name":"Hae Chung","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Kumoh National Institute of Technology, Gumi, Korea"],"firstName":"Hae","lastName":"Chung","id":"37085412336"},{"name":"Sungkwon Hong","affiliation":["InterDigital Asia Limited, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sungkwon","lastName":"Hong","id":"37086166296"},{"name":"Byung Keun Lim","affiliation":["InterDigital Asia Limited, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Byung Keun","lastName":"Lim","id":"37086166696"},{"name":"Liangping Ma","affiliation":["InterDigital Communications, Inc., San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Liangping","lastName":"Ma","id":"37536695200"},{"name":"Byung K.

Exchanging information about the relative directional position of each vehicle together with front and rear-facing direction is significant for fast, accurate and reliable communication. Radio Frequency (RF) (causing extensive interference) or expensive laser (Laser) that is also harmful to the human body are the currently available technology for vehicular communication purposes. Some existing technologies are also using visible light (i.e. LEDs) communications (VLC). But these technologies have the limitation of fast object detection and multiple objects detection as well as maintaining communication simultaneously. However, ensuring high temporal and spatial detection resolution has become one of the challenging tasks for OWC. This paper proposes an image sensor based OWC technique to ensure high temporal and spatial resolution based on VLC system. We proposed an algorithm to support multiple objects detection and communication principal in temporal and spatial condition. We have simulated different scenarios related to spatial and temporal condition using Matlab simulation. The results reveal that our proposed method ensure high temporal and spatial resolution criteria. After all, it also provides secure and fast communication at critical and multiple objects condition efficiently without deploying any tracking method.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763396","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763396.pdf","startPage":"1165","endPage":"1169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High temporal-spatial resolution optical wireless communication technique using image sensor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763396","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763396/","displayDocTitle":"High temporal-spatial resolution optical wireless communication technique using image sensor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519785","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763396/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High temporal-spatial resolution optical wireless communication technique using image sensor","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058049S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763396","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763412,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Arif Hossain","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Mohammad Arif","lastName":"Hossain","id":"37085449838"},{"name":"Amirul Islam","affiliation":["Dept. of Electronics Engineering, Kookmin University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Amirul","lastName":"Islam","id":"37085846130"},{"name":"Yeong Min Jangf","affiliation":["Kookmin University, Seongbok-gu, Seoul, KR"],"firstName":"Yeong Min","lastName":"Jangf"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763412","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":182},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Receivers","Image sensors","Radio transmitters","Bit error rate","Visualization","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","free-space optical communication","image sensors","intensity modulation","optical modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BER","bit error rate","PSNR","peak signal to noise ratio","camera viewing angle effect","geometric issue","radiometric issue","invisible ISC technology","QR code","D2C communication","display-to-camera communication","invisible image sensor communication"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Viewing angle","image sensor communication (ISC)","invisible communication","display-to-camera (D2C) communication","PSNR","BER"]}],"abstract":"Display-to-camera (D2C) communication have become prevalent nowadays due to the development of image sensor communication (ISC).

Several techniques proposed for D2C communication using invisible ISC differ in methodology. Although geometric and radiometric issues have been discussed in the methods, the effects of viewing angle of the camera in the invisible ISC technology has been kept out of the discussion. In this paper, the effects of viewing angle of the camera have been discussed. Our proposed scheme propagates the idea of intensity modulation technique to embed data in the transmitter i.e. display.

CS-based signal and information acquisition/compression paradigm combines the nonlinear reconstruction algorithm and random sampling on a sparse basis that provides a promising approach to compress signal and data in information systems. In this paper, we investigates how CS can provide new insights into coexisting heterogeneous IoT environments. First, we briefly introduce the CS theory with respect to the sampling through providing a compressed sampling process with low computation costs. Then, a CS-based framework is proposed for IoT, in which the hub nodes measure, transmit, and store the sampled data into the fusion center. Then, an efficient cluster-sparse reconstruction algorithm is proposed for in-network compression aiming at more accurate data reconstruction and lower energy efficiency. Therefore, compression should be performed locally at each Access Point (AP) and reconstruction is executed jointly to consider dependencies in the acquired data by the final fusion center.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A compressive sensing-based data processing method for massive IoT environments","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763418","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763418.pdf","startPage":"1242","endPage":"1246","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A compressive sensing-based data processing method for massive IoT environments","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763418/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16573454","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A compressive sensing-based data processing method for massive IoT environments","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"P289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048787S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7763421,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghee Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Yonghee","lastName":"Han","id":"37085545814"},{"name":"Jungwoo Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Jungwoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37280330400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763421","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Training","Array signal processing","Antennas","Estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Millimeter wave technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","compressed sensing","millimetre wave antennas","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmit beam training","CS approach","exhaustive beam training","asymmetric channel estimation scheme","training overhead reduction","compressed sensing","beam search schemes","mmWave channels","beamforming","SNR","signal-to-noise ratio","transmitter antenna","receiver antennas","mmWave systems","multiuser millimeter wave communications"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763421","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763421","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","abstract":"In millimeter wave (mmWave) systems adopting large number of antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver, channel estimation is challenging due to the large number of antennas and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) before beamforming. Due to the sparse nature of mmWave channels, the channel estimation can be solved by beam search. While conventional beam search schemes rely on exhaustive training, it requires excessive overhead scaling proportional to the number of antennas. Compressed sensing (CS) is a promising approach to reduce the training overhead. However, CS shows poor recovery performance with low SNR. In this paper, we propose an asymmetric channel estimation scheme that combines an exhaustive beam training at the receiver side and a CS approach for transmit beam training.

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can approach the optimal unconstrained BER (Bit Error Rate) performance with higher energy efficiency.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763424","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763424.pdf","startPage":"18","endPage":"20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763424","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE-based wideband hybrid precoding for massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763424/","displayDocTitle":"MMSE-based wideband hybrid precoding for massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519836","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763424/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE-based wideband hybrid precoding for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076998S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763447,"authors":[{"name":"Anish Prasad Shrestha","affiliation":["Department of Information & Communication Engg., Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Anish Prasad","lastName":"Shrestha","id":"37062538700"},{"name":"Jongmin Won","affiliation":["Department of Information & Communication Engg., Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jongmin","lastName":"Won","id":"37085683719"},{"name":"Sang-Jo Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Information & Communication Engg., Inha University, Incheon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sang-Jo","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37403379000"},{"name":"Myunghwan Seo","affiliation":["Tactical Communication Team Hanwha Thales Co., Ltd."],"firstName":"Myunghwan","lastName":"Seo","id":"37085546687"},{"name":"Hyung-Weon Cho","affiliation":["Tactical Communication Team Hanwha Thales Co., Ltd."],"firstName":"Hyung-Weon","lastName":"Cho","id":"37085555820"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763447","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Data communication","Genetic algorithms","Channel allocation","Cognitive radio","Optimization","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","channel allocation","cognitive radio","frequency hop communication","genetic algorithms","radio spectrum management","signal detection","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","genetic algorithm based sensing","cognitive ad hoc network","out-of-band spectrum sensing","frequency hopping based cognitive radio network","GA","next hopping channel","traffic demand"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sensing","channel allocation","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763447","abstract":"We present a novel out-of-band spectrum sensing and channel allocation scheme for frequency hopping based cognitive radio networks using genetic algorithm.

the massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay to simultaneously harvest wireless energy from multiple sources' information signals and multiple destinations' energy flows (EFs). Asymptotic expression of the harvested energy is derived when a power splitting relay node employs an unlimited number of antennas. The analysis reveals that the asymptotic harvested energy is independent of the fast fading effect of the wireless channel, meanwhile the transmit powers of each source and each destination can be scaled down inversely proportional to the number of relay antennas. To significantly reduce the energy leakage interference (ELI) and multipair interference (MI), the maximum-ratio combing/maximum-ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) techniques have been employed at the relay node. The exact achievable sum rate and the optimal destination transmit power that maximizes the achievable sum rate are derived in closed-form, respectively. Moreover, the fundamental trade-off between the harvested energy and the achievable sum rate is quantified. It has shown that the destination-aided EFs are beneficial for both the energy harvesting at the relay and the quality improvement of the second-hop link. Meanwhile, the detrimental impact of ELI and MI for signal decoding can be cancelled completely by using MRC/MRT when the number of relay antennas grows without bound.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763473","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763473.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","startPage":"225","endPage":"230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multipair massive MIMO relay with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multipair massive MIMO relay with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763473/","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519994","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multipair massive MIMO relay with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S315.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034975S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7763473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763475,"authors":[{"name":"Galymzhan Nauryzbayev","affiliation":["Faculty of Physics and Technical Sciences, Eurasian National University, Astana, Kazakhstan"],"firstName":"Galymzhan","lastName":"Nauryzbayev","id":"37085541935"},{"name":"Samal Kaliyeva","affiliation":["Faculty of Physics and Technical Sciences, Eurasian National University, Astana, Kazakhstan"],"firstName":"Samal","lastName":"Kaliyeva","id":"37086203797"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763475","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers","Transmitting antennas","Matrix decomposition","Array signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","cellular radio","interference suppression","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["degrees of freedom","single cell MIMO channel","multicell MIMO channel","beamforming matrix","multiple input multiple output user","alignment-based in- terference cancellation scheme","network-MIMO system","interference alignment cancellation scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Beamforming","Interference Alignment","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an alignment-based interference cancellation scheme for a multi-cell network with interfering multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) users.

Therefore, many methods have been proposed to find optimum transmission antenna coefficients to steer omnidirectional beams efficiently. These conventional optimization methods are simple and efficient. However, for massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems, as the number of variables or transmission antenna coefficients to optimize increases, the computation complexity increases exponentially and eventually it is impossible to compute. To solve this problem, we redefine system model by approximation and variable substitution processes to use Fourier transform for analysis. By using these processes, we find new OBF method that is simple and tolerable to the errors inevitably occurred in the processes. Even for the massive MIMO system with hundreds of transmission antennas, the proposed method has only two optimization variables while the conventional methods try to compute hundreds of optimization variables. Moreover we find the values of these two optimization variables asymptotically approaches constant as the number of transmission antennas increases. Therefore, our accomplishment contributes to future analysis for ideal massive MIMO system.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763525.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"526","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763525","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An omnidirectional beamforming technique for massive MIMO systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Array signal processing","MIMO","Finite element analysis","Transforms","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","array signal processing","computational complexity","Fourier transforms","MIMO communication","optimisation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["omnidirectional beamforming technique","massive MIMO systems","beacons","broadcast channels","transmission antenna coefficients","multiple input multiple output systems","computation complexity","approximation processes","variable substitution processes","Fourier transform","OBF method","optimization variables"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Omnidirectional beamforming","massive MIMO beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763525/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"An omnidirectional beamforming technique for massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763525/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519853","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An omnidirectional beamforming technique for massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S525.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05461S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763525","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763526,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuya Tsubone","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuya","lastName":"Tsubone","id":"37086200876"},{"name":"Akio Tsuneda","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Akio","lastName":"Tsuneda","id":"37269821900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763526","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"abstract":"In recent years, positioning measurement is very popular for us with the spread of smartphones, car navigation systems, etc. Not only GPS (global positioning system) but also various local (indoor) positioning systems have been studied widely.

In this paper, we investigate application of DNN technique to automatic classification of modulation classes for digitally modulated signals. First, we select twenty one statistical features which exhibit good separation in empirical distributions for all modulation formats considered (i.e., BPSK, QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM). These features are extracted from the received signal samples and used as the input to the fully connected DNN with three hidden layer. The training data containing 25,000 feature vectors is generated by the computer simulation under both additive Gaussian white noise (AWGN) and Rician fading channels. Our test results show that the proposed method brings dramatic performance improvement over the existing classifier especially for high Doppler fading channels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763537/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519755","htmlLink":"/document/7763537/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Deep neural network-based automatic modulation classification technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deep neural network-based automatic modulation classification technique","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S551.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069778S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763537","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763548,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongyoon Heo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University and INMC, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Jeongyoon","lastName":"Heo","id":"37086207280"},{"name":"Hyung-Sin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University and INMC, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Sin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37406288500"},{"name":"Okhwan Lee","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Suwon, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Okhwan","lastName":"Lee","id":"37086199652"},{"name":"Saewoong Bahk","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University and INMC, Seoul, Republic of Korea"],"firstName":"Saewoong","lastName":"Bahk","id":"37278537700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763548","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":157},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a new energy efficient strategy for 802.11ac networks. 802.11ac uses multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) technique for throughput enhancement. When multiplexing spatial streams of different lengths, 802.11ac pads additional bits for shorter streams to equalize the sizes of all streams. The padding method incurs redundant energy consumption for a receiver while listening useless data. To alleviate the problem, we propose Energy efficient Spatial stream Allocation (ESA). When serving multiple spatial streams, ESA provide energy optimal transmission by minimizing padded bits. To this end, ESA controls both the number of antenna and modulation and coding scheme (MCS). Our simulation result reveals that ESA can significantly reduce energy consumption of receivers without throughput degradation in 802.11ac networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763548.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"630","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763548","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763548","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient spatial stream allocation for multi-user MIMO in 802.11ac networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Multiplexing","Switched-mode power supply","Throughput","Receiving antennas","Energy consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","energy consumption","MIMO communication","modulation coding","space division multiplexing","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MCS","modulation and coding scheme","energy optimal transmission","ESA","redundant energy consumption","padding method","spatial stream multiplexing","throughput enhancement","MU-MIMO technique","802.11ac network","multiuser multiple input multiple output technique","energy efficient spatial stream allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["802.11ac","MU-MIMO","energy efficiency"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763548/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient spatial stream allocation for multi-user MIMO in 802.11ac networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763548/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519813","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient spatial stream allocation for multi-user MIMO in 802.11ac networks","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S623.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092507S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763549,"authors":[{"name":"Taewon Song","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Taewon","lastName":"Song","id":"37889757200"},{"name":"Sangheon Pack","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Sangheon","lastName":"Pack","id":"37267737500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763549","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Resource management","Wireless LAN","Throughput","Downlink","OFDM","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-phase resource allocation algorithm","densely deployed OFDMA WLAN","MAC efficiency enhancement","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","multiuser transmissions","resource management","TPRA algorithm","access points","operational carrier bandwidth","throughput performance enhancement","wireless local area network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Resource allocation","densely deployed WLAN","OFDMA","channel bonding"]}],"abstract":"One of the promising techniques to enhance MAC efficiency is orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). Even though OFDMA-based WLAN allows multi-user transmissions, it requires a careful design of resource management particularly in densely deployed WLANs. To address this problem, we propose a two-phase resource allocation (TPRA) algorithm. In TPRA, an access points (AP) determines its operational carrier bandwidth and bandwidth by means of negotiating with the other APs to be distributed to its connected stations in the first phase. In the second phase, each AP distributes its allocated bandwidths to the associated stations. Numerical results prove that TPRA algorithm enhances throughput performances.","doi":"10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763549","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Information and Communication Technology Convergence (ICTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7750938/7763035/07763549.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTC.2016.7763549","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763035","startPage":"631","endPage":"633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-phase resource allocation algorithm for densely deployed OFDMA WLANs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A two-phase resource allocation algorithm for densely deployed OFDMA WLANs","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763549/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519746","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7763549/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-phase resource allocation algorithm for densely deployed OFDMA WLANs","confLoc":"Jeju, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"S624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053435S","chronDate":"19-21 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7750938","isNumber":"7763035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7750938","xplore-issue":"7763035","articleId":"7763549","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7763560,"authors":[{"name":"YoungJun Kim","affiliation":["Korea University School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"YoungJun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37086198819"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["Korea University School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1325-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1324-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1326-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7763560","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763560","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Photonics","Cryptography","Quantum computing","Detectors","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","quantum cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["long distance transmission","continuous variable quantum key distribution","CV-QKD","channel estimator Cramer-Rao lower bound","channel transmission parameter estimator","CRLB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CV-QKD","GG02","Channel Estimator","CRLB","Coherent state","Squeezed state"]}],"abstract":"The channel estimation is one of the essential components to make the long distance transmission of continuous variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD).

The 5G networks will consist of macrocells, femtocells and picocells with heterogeneous characteristics and capacities which will result in a multi-tier architecture. Hence, interference is one of the main problems in such systems and it will cause degradation in the system performance. Interference alignment techniques can be used to solve this problem. In this paper, a proposed cross-tier interference management algorithm for coexisting two-tier networks is introduced. First at each receiver, we calculate the sum of the square of the channel gains from each macro user to this receiver and the average of those sum values is taken as a threshold. Macro users whose sum values are greater than this threshold are selected and aligned at the femto receiver. This alignment is done by using precoders at the transmitters. In the proposed algorithm, the subspace in which the interference signals would be aligned is identified then a distributed algorithm is applied to identify the precoders needed at the selected interferers. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of selective interference alignment for uplink interference management. The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is used to measure the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/SPA.2016.7763603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPA.2016.7763603","startPage":"147","endPage":"151","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7747740/7763033/07763603.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 Signal Processing: Algorithms, Architectures, Arrangements, and Applications (SPA)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763033","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective interference alignment in 5G networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Selective interference alignment in 5G networks","conferenceDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763603/","accessionNumber":"16519627","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763603/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective interference alignment in 5G networks","confLoc":"Poznan, Poland","sourcePdf":"28.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038701S","chronDate":"21-23 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7747740","isNumber":"7763033","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7747740","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7763033","articleId":"7763603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Division of Signal Processing and Electronic Systems, Poznan University of Technology (DSPES PUT)","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7763608,"authors":[{"name":"Vinay Chakravarthi Gogineni","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Vinay Chakravarthi","lastName":"Gogineni","id":"37085414574"},{"name":"Subrahmanyam Mula","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Subrahmanyam","lastName":"Mula","id":"37085997060"},{"name":"Rajib Lochan Das","affiliation":["Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, New Delhi, Delhi, IN"],"firstName":"Rajib Lochan","lastName":"Das","id":"38469005300"},{"name":"Mrityunjoy Chakraborty","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, INDIA"],"firstName":"Mrityunjoy","lastName":"Chakraborty","id":"37278356500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-83-62065-27-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-83-62065-25-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2661-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2326-0319"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2326-0262"}],"articleNumber":"7763608","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":271},"abstract":"For real-time sparse systems identification applications, Proportionate-type Least Mean Square (Pt-LMS) algorithms are often preferred to their normalized counterparts (Pt-NLMS) due to lower computational complexity of the former algorithms.

A two-step distributed filter algorithm is proposed where the sensor nodes collaboratively estimate the states of the plant by exploiting the information from both the local and the neighboring nodes. The goal of this paper is to design the distributed filters over a wireless sensor network subject to given sporadic communication topology. Moreover, a resilient operation is guaranteed to suppress random perturbations on the actually implemented filter gains. An upper bound is first derived for the filtering error covariance by utilizing an inductive method and such an upper bound is subsequently minimized via iteratively solving a quadratic optimization problem. To account for the topological information of the sensor networks, a novel matrix simplification technique is utilized to preserve the sparsity of the gain matrices in accordance with the given topology, and the analytical parameterization is obtained for the gain matrices of the desired suboptimal filter. Furthermore, a sufficient condition is established to guarantee the mean-square boundedness of the estimation errors. Numerical simulation is carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed filtering algorithm.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763699/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"March1, 1 2017","volume":"65","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"16596025","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2017","publicationDate":"1 March1, 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7763699/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Resilient Approach to Distributed Filter Design for Time-Varying Systems Under Stochastic Nonlinearities and Sensor Degradation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Royal Society of the U.K."},{"fundingName":"Research Fund for the Taishan Scholar Project of Shandong Province of China"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273156, 61473163 and 61522309"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005156","fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resilient Approach to Distributed Filter Design for Time-Varying Systems Under Stochastic Nonlinearities and Sensor Degradation","sourcePdf":"tsp-wang-2634541-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113788S","chronDate":"March1, 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7782900","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"7782900","articleId":"7763699","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7763733,"authors":[{"name":"Aaron Plasek","affiliation":["Columbia University"],"bio":{"p":["Aaron Plasek is a doctoral student in history at Columbia University.

The fabrication process has a low, less than 175\u00b0C, temperature budget and includes a planarization step performed before the deposition of the second crossbar layer. These features greatly improve yield and uniformity of the crosspoint devices and allows for utilizing such a fabrication process for integration with CMOS circuits as well as for stacking of multiple crossbar layers. Furthermore, the integrated crosspoint memristors are optimized for analog computing applications allowing successful forming and switching of all 200 devices in the demonstrated crossbar circuit, and, most importantly, precise tuning of the devices' conductance values within the dynamic range of operation.

Using affective sensing technology, our long-term goal is to develop an objective multimodal system that augments clinical opinion during the diagnosis and monitoring of clinical depression. This paper steps towards developing a classification system-oriented approach, where feature selection, classification and fusion-based experiments are conducted to infer which types of behaviour (verbal and nonverbal) and behaviour combinations can best discriminate between depression and non-depression. Using statistical features extracted from speaking behaviour, eye activity, and head pose, we characterise the behaviour associated with major depression and examine the performance of the classification of individual modalities and when fused. Using a real-world, clinically validated dataset of 30 severely depressed patients and 30 healthy control subjects, a Support Vector Machine is used for classification with several feature selection techniques. Given the statistical nature of the extracted features, feature selection based on T-tests performed better than other methods. Individual modality classification results were considerably higher than chance level (83 percent for speech, 73 percent for eye, and 63 percent for head). Fusing all modalities shows a remarkable improvement compared to unimodal systems, which demonstrates the complementary nature of the modalities. Among the different fusion approaches used here, feature fusion performed best with up to 88 percent average accuracy. We believe that is due to the compatible nature of the extracted statistical features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","volume":"9","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"18832661","dateOfInsertion":"27 November 2018","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7763752/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Multimodal Depression Detection: Fusion Analysis of Paralinguistic, Head Pose and Eye Gaze Behaviors","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council (ARC)","grantNumber":"DP130101094"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimodal Depression Detection: Fusion Analysis of Paralinguistic, Head Pose and Eye Gaze Behaviors","sourcePdf":"taffc-alghowinem-2634527-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123306S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"5165369","isNumber":"8547219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165369","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"8547219","articleId":"7763752","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7763758,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In this paper, we consider a CCR network (CCRN) with energy harvesting in which multiple secondary transmitters (STs) are able to harvest energy from the received signals to serve their own receivers and primary transmitters (PTs). Besides, not only PT's transmitting signal but also interferers, i.e., RF signals in ambient environment received at STs can be used for energy harvesting. Moreover, we aim to analyze the outage probability (OP) for two relay cooperation schemes including single-relay cooperation (SC) and multirelay cooperation (MC) in CCRNs while considering energy harvesting. In addition, we consider Nakagami-m fading rather than Rayleigh fading channels as it is more practical and general for characterizing the fading effect over wireless channels. Most importantly, we compare the outage performance of SC and MC with that of direct transmission and investigate the tradeoff between the primary and secondary users' performance. Simulation results are presented to validate our analysis, which show the exact performance for different parameter settings.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2016.2628862","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE

In our method, the uncertain DG outputs and load demands are formulated as stochastic variables following some ambiguous distributions. In addition to the given expectations and variances, the polyhedral uncertainty intervals are employed for the construction of the probability distribution set to restrict possible distributions. Then, we decide the optimal sizes and locations of DG to maximize the total DG hosting capacity under the worst-case probability distributions among this set. Since more information is utilized, our proposed model is expected to be less conservative than the robust optimization method and the traditional distributionally robust method. Using the CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) reformulation technique and strong duality, we transform the proposed model into an equivalent bilinear matrix inequality problem, and a sequential convex optimization algorithm is applied for solution. Our model guarantees that the probability of security constraints being violated will not exceed a given risk threshold. Besides, the predefined risk level can be tuned to control the conservativeness of our model in a physically meaningful way. The effectiveness and robustness of this proposed method are demonstrated numerically on the two modified IEEE test systems.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8012582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2633299","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8012582/07763786.pdf","startPage":"3946","endPage":"3957","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2633299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-Driven DG Capacity Assessment Method for Active Distribution Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven DG Capacity Assessment Method for Active Distribution Networks","volume":"32","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7763786/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17121848","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763786/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National\u00a0Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB228203"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51477083"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-Driven DG Capacity Assessment Method for Active Distribution Networks","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-wu-2633299-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118766S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8012582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"8012582","articleId":"7763786","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7763796,"authors":[{"name":"Youyi Fu","affiliation":["Center for Memory and Recording Research, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Youyi","lastName":"Fu","orcid":"0000-0002-8318-5922","id":"37085377430"},{"name":"Karcher Morris","affiliation":["Center for Memory and Recording Research, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Karcher","lastName":"Morris","id":"37086060678"},{"name":"Frank E.

The original optimization problem was first transformed into a deterministic bi-objective problem, where new objectives are hyper-volume and imprecision. A set-based Pareto dominance relation was then defined to modify the fast nondominated sorting approach in NSGA-II. Additionally, set-based evolutionary schemes were suggested. Finally, our method was empirically evaluated on 39 benchmark IMaOPs as well as a car cab design problem and compared with two typical methods. The numerical results demonstrated the superiority of our method and indicated that a tradeoff approximate front between convergence and uncertainty can be produced.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2016.2634625","pdfPath":"/iel7/4235/8272041/07763800.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"60","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2016.2634625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8272041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Set-Based Genetic Algorithm for Interval Many-Objective Optimization Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Set-Based Genetic Algorithm for Interval Many-Objective Optimization Problems","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17507550","publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","htmlLink":"/document/7763800/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61375067, 61403155 and 61673404"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2014CB0463062"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Overseas Research and Training Program for University Prominent Young and Middle-Aged Teachers and Presidents"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Set-Based Genetic Algorithm for Interval Many-Objective Optimization Problems","sourcePdf":"tevc-sun-2634625-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106099S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"8272041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"8272041","articleId":"7763800","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7763815,"authors":[{"name":"Weijie Feng","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Weijie","lastName":"Feng","orcid":"0000-0003-0360-9412","id":"37086019314"},{"name":"Ying Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086023959"},{"name":"Wenquan Che","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Wenquan","lastName":"Che","id":"37284442800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"7763815","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1380},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonator filters","Dual band","Resonant frequency","Couplings","Varactors","Matched filters","Passband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harmonics suppression","microstrip lines","multiplexing equipment","resonator filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tunable dual-band filter","folded open loop ring resonators","OLRR","microstrip transmission lines","maximal magnetic coupling","feeding lines","dual-band filter-diplexer","dc bias voltages","varactors","broad harmonic suppression","lumped elements"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diplexer","dual-band filter","harmonic suppression","open loop ring resonator (OLRRs)","tunable"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763815","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/8016697/07763815.pdf","startPage":"1047","endPage":"1051","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2016.2634555","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2634555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8016697","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tunable Dual-Band Filter and Diplexer Based on Folded Open Loop Ring Resonators","abstract":"Tunable dual-band filter and diplexer based on folded open loop ring resonators (OLRRs) are proposed in this brief. Two pairs of OLRRs of different center frequencies are utilized to couple with microstrip transmission lines in these two devices, and there is no extra matching network in the diplexer structure. Maximal magnetic coupling and high isolation can be obtained by placing the resonators at proper positions along the feeding lines. The passband/channel frequencies of the dual-band filter/diplexer can be tuned independently by varying dc bias voltages applied to the varactors loaded at one end of the resonators. In addition, a broad harmonic suppression can be obtained by choosing appropriate lumped elements adding to the OLRRs. The performances of the proposed devices can be verified by the simulated and measured results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763815/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","volume":"64","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"17135425","dateOfInsertion":"25 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7763815/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Tunable Dual-Band Filter and Diplexer Based on Folded Open Loop Ring Resonators","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"6140010914 and 61571231"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20140791"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005271","fundingName":"2014 Zijin Intelligent Program of Nanjing University of Science and Technology"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tunable Dual-Band Filter and Diplexer Based on Folded Open Loop Ring Resonators","sourcePdf":"tcsii-feng-2634555-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086882S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"8016697","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"8016697","articleId":"7763815","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7763821,"authors":[{"name":"Ville Niemel\u00e4","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7936707/7763821/nieme-2634593-small.gif","p":["Ville Niemel\u00e4 received the M.Sc. degree in wireless communications from the University of Oulu, Finland, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree researching in IR-UWB receivers in different wireless body area networks.

This growing proliferation, however, is changing the traditional consumption load curves by adding considerable levels of variability and further challenging the electricity supply-demand balance. In this paper, the application of microgrids in effectively capturing the distribution network net load variability, caused primarily by the prosumers, is investigated. Microgrids provide a viable and localized solution to this challenge, while removing the need for costly investments by the electric utility on reinforcing the existing electricity infrastructure. A flexibility-oriented microgrid optimal scheduling model is proposed and developed to coordinate the microgrid net load with the aggregated consumers/prosumers net load in the distribution network with a focus on ramping issues. The proposed coordination is performed to capture both inter- and intra-hour net load variabilities. Numerical simulations on a test distribution feeder with one microgrid and several consumers and prosumers exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/8012582/07763825.pdf","startPage":"3660","endPage":"3669","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2635024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2016.2635024","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8012582","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Microgrids in Supporting Distribution Grid Flexibility","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microgrids","Optimal scheduling","Load modeling","Indexes","Energy storage","Numerical models","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","load (electric)","numerical analysis","power consumption","power distribution reliability","power generation reliability","power generation scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microgrids application","distribution grid flexibility","distributed renewable energy resources","load-point reliability improvement","consumption load curves","electricity supply-demand balance","distribution network net load variability","localized solution","electric utility","electricity infrastructure","flexibility-oriented microgrid optimal scheduling model","aggregated consumers-prosumers net load","inter-hour net load variabilities","intra-hour net load variabilities","numerical simulations","distribution feeder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed generation","duck curve","flexibility microgrid optimal scheduling","renewable energy resource"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Application of Microgrids in Supporting Distribution Grid Flexibility","volume":"32","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7763825/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17121823","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Microgrids in Supporting Distribution Grid Flexibility","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-khodaei-2635024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081871S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8012582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"8012582","articleId":"7763825","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7763831,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew M.

Without mitigation, SEUs can cause failure by altering the logic, routing, and state of a design operating on an SRAM-based FPGA. Various combinations of SEU mitigation and repair techniques are applied to the LEON3 soft-core processor to study the effects and complementary nature of each technique. This work focuses on Triple modular redundancy (TMR), configuration memory (CRAM) scrubbing, and internal block memory (BRAM) scrubbing. All mitigation methods demonstrate some improvement in both fault injection and neutron radiation testing. Results in this paper show complementary SEU mitigation techniques working together to improve fault-tolerance. The results also suggest that fault injection can be a good way to estimate the cross section of a design before going to a radiation test. TMR with CRAM scrubbing demonstrates a 27\u00d7 improvement whereas TMR with both CRAM and BRAM scrubbing demonstrates approximately a 50\u00d7 improvement.","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2016.2635028","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7869239/07763831.pdf","startPage":"519","endPage":"528","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2016.2635028","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benefits of Complementary SEU Mitigation for the LEON3 Soft Processor on SRAM-Based FPGAs","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/23/7869239/7763831-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Benefits of Complementary SEU Mitigation for the LEON3 Soft Processor on SRAM-Based FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7763831/","accessionNumber":"16721522","volume":"64","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"I/UCRC Program of the National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1265957"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Benefits of Complementary SEU Mitigation for the LEON3 Soft Processor on SRAM-Based FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tns-keller-2635028-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071799S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7869239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7869239","articleId":"7763831","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":7763832,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaolong Ning","affiliation":["Key Laboratory for Ubiquitous Network and Service Software of Liaoning Province, School of Software, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7904755/7763832/ning-2635081-small.gif","p":["Zhaolong Ning (M\u201914) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from\n Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2011 and 2014, respectively.","He was a Research Fellow at Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.

Although intelligent terminals can be leveraged to deliver and exchange data through Internet, poor network coverage and expensive network access challenge the deployment of network infrastructure. In this paper, we propose a social-oriented smartphone-based adaptive transmission mechanism to improve the network connectivity and throughput in Internet of Things (IoTs) for smart cities. First, a social-oriented double-auction-based relay selection scheme is investigated to stimulate the relay smartphones to forward packets for others so that the network connectivity can be strengthened. Furthermore, for the sake of achieving high throughput in smartphone-based IoTs, the relay method selection is determined by integrating various kinds of transmission schemes in an optimal fashion to make full use of wireless spectrum resource. Due to its high computational complexity, a firefly-algorithm-based scheme is investigated, by which the formulated NP-complete problem can be solved effectively. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2016.2635081","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904755","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2016.2635081","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7904755/07763832.pdf","startPage":"810","endPage":"820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Social-Oriented Adaptive Transmission in Opportunistic Internet of Smartphones","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Social-Oriented Adaptive Transmission in Opportunistic Internet of Smartphones","volume":"13","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763832/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16823969","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763832/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61572106, 61502075 and 61672123"},{"fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Funded Project","grantNumber":"2015M580224"},{"fundingName":"Liaoning Province Doctor Startup Fund","grantNumber":"201501166"},{"fundingName":"Dalian Science and Technology Planning Project","grantNumber":"2015A11GX015 and 2015R054"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Social-Oriented Adaptive Transmission in Opportunistic Internet of Smartphones","sourcePdf":"tii-xia-2635081-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.284999S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7904755","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"7904755","articleId":"7763832","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7763838,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The proposed reference utilizes only four MOS transistors and two lateral PNP transistors, which are usually available in standard CMOS technologies along with one well resistor. The temperature-compensation technique has a low process dependence and needs no trimming. However, resistor trimming can be used to precisely set the output current value. The circuit implementation of the proposed technique was fabricated in a standard 0.35-\u03bcm CMOS process to source a 16-\u03bcA current. The digital calibration circuit allows setting of the output current in 32 100 nA-steps. The proposed current reference achieves the supply sensitivity of several %/V without the use of the external bandgap voltage reference for the supply regulation. The measured temperature coefficient is 105 ppm/\u00b0C over the temperature range from 0 to 110 \u00b0C.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2016.2634779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and

massive multiple-input multiple-output system depends strongly on the number of antennas at base stations (BSs) and the receiver architecture. The existing research has focused on linear receivers, such as those based on zero forcing (ZF) or linear minimum mean squared error detectors. In this letter, we investigate the EE when nonlinear successive-interference cancellation (SIC) receivers are employed at the BSs and provide an asymptotic analysis of the total transmit power with ZF-SIC. We show that to achieve the same spectrum efficiency, the SIC receivers require fewer antennas at BSs, but only moderate increase of the receiver complexity.

The aim is to minimize charging cost while reducing energy demand from the grid by increasing PV self-consumption and consequently increasing sustainability of the BEV fleet. The developed EMS consists of two components: An autoregressive integrated moving average model to predict PV power production and a mixed-integer linear programming framework that optimally allocates power to minimize charging cost. The results show that the developed EMS is able to reduce charging cost significantly, while increasing PV self-consumption and reducing energy consumption from the grid. Furthermore, during a case study analogous to one repeatedly considered in the literature, i.e., dynamic purchase tariff and dynamic feed-in tariff, the EMS reduces charging cost by 118.44% and 427.45% in case of one and two charging points, respectively, when compared to an uncontrolled charging policy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Management System With PV Power Forecast to Optimally Charge EVs at the Workplace","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2016.2634624","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8246762/07763845.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2016.2634624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8246762","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763845","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763845/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","displayDocTitle":"Energy Management System With PV Power Forecast to Optimally Charge EVs at the Workplace","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7763845/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2018","publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","accessionNumber":"17485857","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"URSES"},{"fundingName":"Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Management System With PV Power Forecast to Optimally Charge EVs at the Workplace","sourcePdf":"tii-vandermeer-2634624-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119324S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8246762","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"8246762","articleId":"7763845","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7763846,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The SC amplifier achieves low-power metric with two operating modes using operation-phase-dependent biasing and compensation scheme in the op-amp design. This novel op-amp works in high-bandwidth high-power mode to sample the bridge signal for 13\u03bcs twice and in low-bandwidth low-power mode for 474\u03bcs over 500\u03bcs measurement interval. To further reduce the power of the SC amplifier in system level, a SC level-shift design is adopted. Regarding offset calibration, a capacitor divider based trimming scheme is implemented to generate the mid-point DC output voltage under the constraint of the feedback capacitor size. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS, the SC interface together with the regulator, voltage reference and trimming circuit occupies an area of 0.358 mm2. For the first test setup utilizing Half Wheatstone Bridge, the proposed SC amplifier consumes 12.3\u03bcW at 1 V regulated supply with a 2 kHz system clock. The measured Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of SC circuit is 55.6 dB. In the second test setup using a commercial sensor with 0.092 mV/kPa sensitivity, the interface has demonstrated the sensing function with sensitivity of 3.52 mV/kPa. Finally, compared to the representative prior-arts, this work has achieved the best energy-noise figure-of-merit at identical fractional resistance change.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2016.2625310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2016.2625310","startPage":"799","endPage":"810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7887772/07763846.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7887772","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Energy-Noise 65nm CMOS Switched-Capacitor Resistive-Bridge Sensor Interface","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Low Energy-Noise 65nm CMOS Switched-Capacitor Resistive-Bridge Sensor Interface","volume":"64","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16775958","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7763846/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"MediaTek Singapore Pte.

Many spacecraft are computationally constrained because all of the computation is done on a single radiation-hardened microprocessor. It is possible that a commercial microprocessor could be used for configuration, monitoring and background tasks that are not mission critical. Most commercial microprocessors are affected by radiation, including single-event effects (SEEs) that could be destructive to the component or corrupt the data. Part screening can help designers avoid components with destructive failure modes, and mitigation can suppress data corruption. We have been experimenting with a method for masking radiation-induced faults through the software executing on the microprocessor. While triple-modular redundancy (TMR) techniques are very effective at masking faults in software, the increased amount of execution time to complete the computation is not desirable. In this paper we present a technique for combining duplication with compare (DWC) with TMR that decreases observable errors by as much as 145 times with only a 2.35 time decrease in performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Duplication With Comparison Methods in Microcontrollers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2016.2634781","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/23/7869239/07763859.pdf","startPage":"338","endPage":"345","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2016.2634781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7869239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763859/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Robust Duplication With Comparison Methods in Microcontrollers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7763859/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16721591","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008902","fundingName":"Los Alamos National Laboratory"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Duplication With Comparison Methods in Microcontrollers","sourcePdf":"tns-quinn-2634781-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064405S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"7869239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7869239","articleId":"7763859","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7763864,"authors":[{"name":"Jo\u00e3o P.

Although correntropy has been used with complex data, no theoretical study was pursued to elucidate its properties, nor how to best use it for optimization. By using a probabilistic interpretation, this work presents a novel similarity measure between two complex random variables, which is defined as complex correntropy. A new recursive solution for the maximum complex correntropy criterion is introduced based on a fixed-point solution. This technique is applied to a system identification, and the results demonstrate prominent advantages when compared against three other algorithms: the complex least mean square, complex recursive least squares, and least absolute deviation. By the aforementioned probabilistic interpretation, correntropy can now be applied to solve several problems involving complex data in a more straightforward way.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2016.2634534","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7784861","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2016.2634534","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/7784861/07763864.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"45","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex Correntropy: Probabilistic Interpretation and Application to Complex-Valued Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Complex Correntropy: Probabilistic Interpretation and Application to Complex-Valued Data","volume":"24","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","dateOfInsertion":"20 December 2016","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763864/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16561126","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763864/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex Correntropy: Probabilistic Interpretation and Application to Complex-Valued Data","sourcePdf":"lsp-guimaraes-2634534-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.14261S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"7784861","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7784861","articleId":"7763864","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7763867,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Chen","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Intelligent Control and Decision of Complex System, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7959588/7763867/chen-2628864-small.gif","p":["Jie Chen received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in control theory and control engineering from the Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, in 1986, 1993, and 2000, respectively.","He is currently a Professor of Control Science and Engineering with the Beijing Institute of Technology.

The sampling intervals are assumed to vary within a known interval. The transmission delay is assumed to belong to a given interval. The closed-loop system is first converted to a discrete-time system with multiple time-varying delays and norm-bounded uncertainties resulting from the variation of the sampling intervals. And then, it is transformed into a delay-free system being form of an interconnection of two subsystems. By utilizing scaled small gain theorem, an asymptotic stability criterion for the closed-loop system is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequality.

For mashup developers, looking for desired component services from a sea of service candidates is often challenging. Therefore, web service recommendation has become a highly demanding technique. Traditional approaches, however, mostly rely on static and potentially subjectively described texts offered by service providers. In this paper, we propose a novel way of dynamically reconstructing objective service profiles based on mashup descriptions, which carry historical information of how services are used in mashups. Our key idea is to leverage mashup descriptions and structures to discover important word features of services and bridge the vocabulary gap between mashup developers and service providers. Specifically, we jointly model mashup descriptions and component service using author topic model in order to reconstruct service profiles. Exploiting word features derived from the reconstructed service profiles, a new service recommendation algorithm is developed. Experiments over a real-world data set from ProgrammableWeb.com demonstrate that our proposed service recommendation algorithm is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/8332019/07763869.pdf","startPage":"468","endPage":"478","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2016.2624310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2016.2624310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8332019","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763869","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web Service Recommendation With Reconstructed Profile From Mashup Descriptions","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mashups","Quality of service","Vocabulary","Computational modeling","Business","Bridges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","recommender systems","service-oriented architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["web service recommendation","reconstructed profile","self-contained software components","business process automation","value-added service compositions","complicated business requirements","mashup developers","desired component services","service candidates","highly demanding technique","static described texts","potentially subjectively described texts","service providers","objective service profiles","leverage mashup descriptions","model mashup descriptions","component service","reconstructed service profiles","service recommendation algorithm","ProgrammableWeb.com"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Author topic model (ATM)","mashup creation","mashup descriptions","service recommendation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Web Service Recommendation With Reconstructed Profile From Mashup Descriptions","volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7763869/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 2018","accessionNumber":"17685423","dateOfInsertion":"05 April 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61673230"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Support Program of China","grantNumber":"2012BAF15G01"},{"fundingName":"National High Tech Research and Development Program","grantNumber":"2012AA02A613"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Service Recommendation With Reconstructed Profile From Mashup Descriptions","sourcePdf":"tase-zhong-2624310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106385S","chronDate":"April  2018","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"8332019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8332019","articleId":"7763869","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7763873,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew J.

These data are often referred to as un structured. The first task in its analytics is to derive a low dimensional representation, a graph or discrete manifold, that describes well the interrelations among the time series and their intra relations across time. This paper presents a computationally tractable algorithm for estimating this graph that structures the data. The resulting graph is directed and weighted, possibly capturing causal relations, not just reciprocal correlations as in many existing approaches in the literature. A convergence analysis is carried out. The algorithm is demonstrated on random graph datasets and real network time series datasets, and its performance is compared to that of related methods. The adjacency matrices estimated with the new method are close to the true graph in the simulated data and consistent with prior physical knowledge in the real dataset tested.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2016.2634543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7845749","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2016.2634543","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/7845749/07763882.pdf","startPage":"2077","endPage":"2092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Signal Processing on Graphs: Causal Modeling of <i>Un</i>structured Data","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/78/7845749/7763882-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Signal Processing on Graphs: Causal Modeling of <i>Un</i>structured Data","volume":"65","issue":"8","chronOrPublicationDate":"April15, 15 2017","dateOfInsertion":"07 February 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763882/","publicationDate":"15 April15, 2017","accessionNumber":"16652561","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763882/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF 1011903 and CCF 1513936"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Signal Processing on Graphs: Causal Modeling of <italic>Un</italic>structured Data","sourcePdf":"tsp-moura-2634543-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.119599S","chronDate":"April15, 15 2017","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7845749","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"7845749","articleId":"7763882","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7763883,"authors":[{"name":"Xi-Qing Liu","affiliation":["Communication Research Center, Harbin Institute of Technology, Haerbin Shi, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7981437/7763883/liu-2635032-small.gif","p":["Xi-Qing Liu received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in communication and\n information engineering from Harbin University of Science and Technology, Harbin, China, in 2009 and 2012,\n respectively.

To deal with this issue, the symbol cyclic shift equalization (SCSE) algorithm was proposed to implement a CP-free OFDM system. In this paper, we aim to further reduce the computational complexity of the SCSE algorithm. In particular, a pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is used at a transmitter to construct conjugate symmetric OFDM blocks, while only partial samples in an OFDM block are involved in the SCSE algorithm at the receiver side, leading to a significantly reduced implementation complexity if compared to an SCSE quadratic-amplitude modulation(QAM)/phase-shift keying (PSK)-OFDM system, where all samples in an OFDM block must be involved in the detection process. The performance of the proposed SCSE PAM-OFDM scheme is analyzed and compared to traditional OFDM systems. The results obtained from this paper verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Interference","Modulation","Complexity theory","Receivers","Delays","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","interference suppression","intersymbol interference","OFDM modulation","pulse amplitude modulation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PAM-OFDM","low complexity CP-free OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","conjugate symmetric OFDM blocks","pulse amplitude modulation","computational complexity reduction","SCSE algorithm","symbol cyclic shift equalization","impaired spectrum efficiency","time-dispersive channels","ISI suppression","intersymbol interference suppression","cyclic prefix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational complexity","cyclic prefix (CP)","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","symbol cyclic shift equalization (SCSE)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763883","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2635032","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07763883.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2635032","startPage":"5933","endPage":"5946","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol Cyclic Shift Equalization PAM-OFDM\u2014A Low Complexity CP-Free OFDM Scheme","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Symbol Cyclic Shift Equalization PAM-OFDM\u2014A Low Complexity CP-Free OFDM Scheme","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763883/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","volume":"66","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7763883/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026865","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671186 and 61471143"},{"fundingName":"Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"99-2221-E-006-016-MY3 and 104-2221-E-006-081-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol Cyclic Shift Equalization PAM-OFDM\u2014A Low Complexity CP-Free OFDM Scheme","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2635032-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062503S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7763883","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7763884,"authors":[{"name":"Tao Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Michigan\u2013Dearborn, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/8388565/7763884/chen-2635025-small.gif","p":["Tao Chen (S\u201915) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Anhui University, Hefei, China, in 2012, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland, in 2014.

Both dual-phase and multi-phase selective decode-and-forward relaying protocols are considered for the end-to-end communication in a multiple relay cooperative system, followed by presentation of complete analyses for the same. For each protocol, closed-form expressions are derived for the per-frame average pair-wise error probability and asymptotic error floor over independent and nonidentical time-selective Rayleigh fading links. A framework is also developed for obtaining the optimal source relay power factors for each of the above protocols, which significantly improve the end-to-end reliability of the system for a given power budget. It is shown that both the multirelay systems achieve the full diversity order (DO) when all the nodes are static and perfect channel estimates are available at each receiving node. The DO of the system reduces to that of the direct source-destination link for a scenario when only the relays are mobile. Interestingly, however, in other mobile scenarios, both the systems are limited by an asymptotic error floor with increasing signal to noise ratio. Further, the impact of DO of the source-relay and relay-destination links on the optimal source-relay power allocation is also explicitly demonstrated. Simulation results yield several important insights into the end-to-end error performance for different mobility conditions and also validate the derived analytical results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO-STBC Based Multiple Relay Cooperative Communication Over Time-Selective Rayleigh Fading Links With Imperfect Channel Estimates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2634924","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07763886.pdf","startPage":"6009","endPage":"6025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2634924","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7763886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763886/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"01 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"MIMO-STBC Based Multiple Relay Cooperative Communication Over Time-Selective Rayleigh Fading Links With Imperfect Channel Estimates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7763886/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026879","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"IIMA IDEA Telecom Centre of Excellence"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO-STBC Based Multiple Relay Cooperative Communication Over Time-Selective Rayleigh Fading Links With Imperfect Channel Estimates","sourcePdf":"tvt-varshney-2634924-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125183S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7763886","onlineDate":"01 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7763903,"authors":[{"name":"Jianhang Gao","affiliation":["Twitter Inc., San Francisco, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488902/7763892/7763903/gao-2600030-small.gif","p":["Jianhang Gao received the bachelor's degree in engineering\n physics from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2010, and the PhD degree in electrical and computer engineering\n from the University of California, Davis, California, in 2015.

A subset of nodes in a given graph is an IDS if the values of these nodes are sufficient to infer the values of all nodes. We focus on two fundamental algorithmic problems: (i) how to determine whether a given subset of nodes is an IDS; (ii) how to construct a minimum IDS. Assuming binary node values and the local majority rule for information correlation, we first show that in acyclic graphs, both problems admit linear-complexity solutions by establishing a connection between the IDS problems and the vertex cover problem. We then show that in a general graph, the first problem is co-NP-complete and the second problem is NP-hard. We develop two approaches to solve the IDS problems: one reduces the problems to a hitting set problem based on the concept of essential difference set, the other a gradient-based approach with a tunable parameter that trades off performance with time complexity. The concept of IDS finds applications in opinion sampling such as political polling and market survey, identifying critical nodes in information networks, and inferring epidemics and cascading failures in communication and infrastructure networks.","doi":"10.1109/TNSE.2016.2600030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNSE.2016.2600030","startPage":"299","endPage":"311","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488902/7763892/07763903.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763892","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Minimum Information Dominating Set for Opinion Sampling in Social Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"The Minimum Information Dominating Set for Opinion Sampling in Social Networks","publicationDate":"1 Oct.-Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"3","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7763903/","accessionNumber":"16518733","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7763903/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Army Research Laboratory Network Science","grantNumber":"W911NF-09-2-0053"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Minimum Information Dominating Set for Opinion Sampling in Social Networks","sourcePdf":"tnse-gao-2600030-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149492S","chronDate":"Oct.-Dec. 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488902","isNumber":"7763892","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488902","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7763892","articleId":"7763903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7763925,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The simulation experiment shows that the accuracy rate and the average relative error of complete data get better results, besides the quality of completed data is improved effectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764057/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16519489","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764057/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Data completing of missing wind power data based on adaptive BP neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data completing of missing wind power data based on adaptive BP neural network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"030.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.123424S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7747737","isNumber":"7763922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7747737","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7763922","articleId":"7764057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7764077,"authors":[{"name":"Ruili Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ruili","lastName":"Ye","id":"37088432064"},{"name":"Zhizhong Guo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhizhong","lastName":"Guo","id":"37271605700"},{"name":"Ruiye Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ruiye","lastName":"Liu","id":"37418867800"},{"name":"Jiannan Liu","affiliation":["State Grid AC Engineering Construction Company, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiannan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37086169874"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1970-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1969-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1971-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7764077","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Wind speed","Forecasting","Wavelet packets","Particle swarm optimization","Wind farms","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","particle swarm optimisation","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-term wind speed forecasting","wavelet packet decomposition","Elman neural network","wind farms","power grids","particle swarm optimization","China"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wind power","wind farm","short-term wind speed forecasting","wavelet packet decomposition(WPD)","Elman neural network(ENN)","particle swarm optimization(PSO)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764077","abstract":"Accurate prediction of wind speed is of great significance to the operation and maintenance of wind farms, the optimal scheduling of turbines and the safe and stable operation of power grids. This paper puts forward a new method for short-term wind speed forecasting based on the wavelet packet decomposition(WPD) theory and an improved Elman neural network(ENN), and the concrete application steps of the method is given. WPD theory is firstly adopted to decompose wind speed data into several wavelet spaces, and according to the correlation, the optimal decomposition tree will be persisted and random data will be rejected. Then a new particle swarm optimization (PSO) training algorithm with disturbance is proposed to improve the training speed of neural networks and deal with the drawback of PSO's easily falling into local optimal solution. Finally, ENNs with different structures are established and used to find the laws of wind speed in different frequency bands, prediction results are hence received. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by wind speed data of a wind farm in south China.","doi":"10.1109/PMAPS.2016.7764077","pdfPath":"/iel7/7747737/7763922/07764077.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems (PMAPS)","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Probabilistic Methods Applied to Power Systems (PMAPS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PMAPS.2016.7764077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7763922","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term wind speed forecasting method based on wavelet packet decomposition and improved Elman neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Short-term wind speed forecasting method based on wavelet packet decomposition and improved Elman neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16519479","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7764077/","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term wind speed forecasting method based on wavelet packet decomposition and improved Elman neural network","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095122S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7747737","isNumber":"7763922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7747737","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7763922","articleId":"7764077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7764155,"authors":[{"name":"Wenzu Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, P.

DNN models including long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have achieved better results compared with traditional methods. Further, probabilistic forecasting based on conditional error analysis is also implemented.

The uncertainty associated with renewable power makes it impossible to tackle this problem via a brute-force approach, i.e. it is not possible to run detailed online static or dynamic simulations for all possible security problems and realizations of load and renewable power. Intelligent approaches for online security assessment with forecast uncertainty modeling are being sought to better handle contingency events. This paper reports the platform developed within the iTesla project for online static and dynamic security assessment. This innovative and open-source computational platform is composed of several modules such as detailed static and dynamic simulation, machine learning, forecast uncertainty representation and optimization tools to not only filter contingencies but also to provide the best control actions to avoid possible unsecure situations. Based on High Performance Computing (HPC), the iTesla platform was tested in the French network for a specific security problem: overload of transmission circuits. The results obtained show that forecast uncertainty representation is of the utmost importance, since from apparently secure forecast network states, it is possible to obtain unsecure situations that need to be tackled in advance by the system operator.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7764166/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16519495","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Online security assessment with load and renewable generation uncertainty: The iTesla project approach","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online security assessment with load and renewable generation uncertainty: The iTesla project approach","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"198.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101502S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7747737","isNumber":"7763922","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7747737","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7763922","articleId":"7764166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7764217,"authors":[{"name":"Tamara Becejac","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Becejac","id":"37086157352"},{"name":"Payman Dehghanian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Payman","lastName":"Dehghanian","id":"38016042600"},{"name":"Mladen Kezunovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA"],"firstName":"Mladen","lastName":"Kezunovic","id":"37271881100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1970-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1969-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1971-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7764217","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phasor measurement units","Standards","Testing","Calibration","Probabilistic logic","Maintenance engineering","Performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calibration","maintenance engineering","phasor measurement","probability","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probabilistic assessment","phasor measurement units","PMU integrity","periodic maintenance","C37.118.1a-2014","PMU measurement errors","statistical measure","field calibrator system","synchrophasor standard requirements","performance degradation probabilities","synchrophasor-based applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["calibration","periodic maintenance","phasor measurement","probabilistic","standard type-tests","synchrophasor"]}],"abstract":"The standard C37.118.1a-2014 has specified the permissible limits for PMU measurement errors under various static and dynamic test conditions.

Security is a very important but not well addressed issue in CR networks. In this article we focus on security problems arising from primary user emulation (PUE) attacks in CR networks. We present a comprehensive introduction to PUE attacks, from the attack rationale and its impact on CR networks, to detection and defense approaches. In order to secure CR networks against PUE attacks, a two-level database-assisted detection approach is proposed to detect such attacks. Energy detection and location verification are combined for fast and reliable detection. An admission-control- based defense approach is proposed to mitigate the performance degradation of a CR network under a PUE attack.

The DLMS algorithm introduces a delay while updating the coefficients of the filter and thus permits the pipelining in feedback loops. The important requirement of adaptive filter is faster convergence. This is achieved by the proposed method by multiplying the error value in the MAC unit. This removes the need for checking the new weight for filter convergence.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Adders","Finite impulse response filters","Filtering algorithms","Signal processing algorithms","Pipeline processing","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","convergence of numerical methods","least mean squares methods","signal denoising","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAC unit","error value","convergence","feedback loops","pipelining","weight vector","DLMS adaptive filter","delayed least mean square filter","noise cancellation application","low complexity fast least mean square filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["low complex DLMS algorithm","modified MAC unit","adaptive filter","weight update"]}],"doi":"10.1109/RAINS.2016.7764371","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Research Advances in Integrated Navigation Systems (RAINS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Research Advances in Integrated Navigation Systems (RAINS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755681/7764359/07764371.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764359","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAINS.2016.7764371","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of low complexity fast least mean square filter for noise cancellation application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764371","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of low complexity fast least mean square filter for noise cancellation application","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764371/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764371/","accessionNumber":"16520367","conferenceDate":"6-7 May 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 May 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of low complexity fast least mean square filter for noise cancellation application","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"RAINS09.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044017S","chronDate":"6-7 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755681","isNumber":"7764359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7755681","xplore-issue":"7764359","articleId":"7764371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7764379,"authors":[{"name":"Honey Mehta","affiliation":["IET Bhaddal, Ropar, Punjab"],"firstName":"Honey","lastName":"Mehta","id":"37086187959"},{"name":"Sanjay Singla","affiliation":["IET Bhaddal, Ropar, Punjab"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Singla","id":"37085568381"},{"name":"Aarti Mahajan","affiliation":["IET Bhaddal, Ropar, Punjab"],"firstName":"Aarti","lastName":"Mahajan","id":"37086190770"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1111-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1112-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7764379","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":613},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764379","abstract":"Character recognition from scanned images is a very complex task.

The govt. of India is also contributing several projects based on energy conservation. The Designing of a single-inductor dual output (SIDO) fly-back power factor correction (PFC) converter is proposed, in which the PFC and power conversion are done at the same time, multiplexing of a single-inductor is implemented through which each output can be regulated independently. The converter will be operating under in critical conduction mode (CCM). A SIDO PFC converter is a system of dual efficient DC output obtained from the AC source, it can also be replaced by solar panel and our system is capable of running a dc motor also, fly back converter can be used in both ac-dc and dc-dc conversion process.

Today's cloud computing has become the buzzword (i.e. pay as you go) in the computing world. As extension of cloud technology, vehicle used cloud services to exchange communications over road network. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) were primarily designed to support the communication between totally different vehicles (V2V) and therefore the communication between vehicles and the margin infrastructures (V2I). Vehicle Cloud Computing (VCC) is a new field of research that aims to study vehicle agents (people, vehicles, robots etc.) as they interact and collaborate to sense the environment, process the data, propagate the results and more generally share resources to exchanges communication. They need not be concerned about over-provisioning for a service whose popularity does not meet their predictions, wasting costly resources, or under-provisioning for one that becomes wildly popular, missing potential customers and revenue. Trust is an essential concern for vehicle users during using cloud services. Vehicles used location based services (during user's journey) to find the nearest location, point of interest etc. This paper aims to reduce that confusion by clarifying terms between vehicular network and vehicular cloud, and provides trusted services to vehicle users with opportunities of Cloud Computing.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Research Advances in Integrated Navigation Systems (RAINS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755681/7764359/07764391.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Research Advances in Integrated Navigation Systems (RAINS)","doi":"10.1109/RAINS.2016.7764391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RAINS.2016.7764391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Providing trust enabled services in vehicular cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Vehicles","Software as a service","Roads","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cloud computing","telecommunication computing","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trust enabled services","vehicular cloud computing","cloud technology","road network","vehicular ad-hoc networks","VANET","V2V","V2I","VCC","vehicle users"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Vehicular Ad-Hoc","Network","Trust","Safety and Non-Safety applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764391/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-7 May 2016","displayDocTitle":"Providing trust enabled services in vehicular cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764391/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"16520363","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"6-7 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Providing trust enabled services in vehicular cloud computing","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"RAINS20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.204702S","chronDate":"6-7 May 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755681","isNumber":"7764359","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7755681","xplore-issue":"7764359","articleId":"7764391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764422,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As an efficient technological solution we present a concentric ring sealing, realized around the interconnect in the very same alloy, thereby forming a joint of its own. We compare different aspect ratios of upper and lower joining parts, as well as single joint sealing and multiple joint sealing. We demonstrate the post-bonding states of the sealing using CuSnAg, AuSn transient liquid phase bonding (TLPB) and Cu-Cu thermocompression bonding. We lay emphasis on the resulting intermetallic compounds and present shear strengths of consistently beyond 30 MPa, reaching up to 85 MPa, which clearly shows the feasibility of the concept.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intra-stack sealing of tier interconnects using the interconnect alloy","publicationTitle":"2016 6th Electronic System-Integration Technology Conference (ESTC)","doi":"10.1109/ESTC.2016.7764489","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 6th Electronic System-Integration Technology Conference (ESTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751138/7764447/07764489.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTC.2016.7764489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764447","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764489/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Intra-stack sealing of tier interconnects using the interconnect alloy","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764489/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520065","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intra-stack sealing of tier interconnects using the interconnect alloy","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"s1p1_87_Kleff_a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045937S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751138","isNumber":"7764447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751138","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7764447","articleId":"7764489","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764498,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Brunschwiler","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Brunschwiler","id":"37265770000"},{"name":"Ra\u00fal Mro\u00dfko","affiliation":["AMIC - Angewandte Micro-Messtechnik GmbH, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Ra\u00fal","lastName":"Mro\u00dfko","id":"37542894700"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Keller","affiliation":["AMIC - Angewandte Micro-Messtechnik GmbH, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Keller","id":"37085608996"},{"name":"Ozgur Ozsun","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ozgur","lastName":"Ozsun","id":"38110896800"},{"name":"Gerd Schlottig","affiliation":["IBM Research, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Gerd","lastName":"Schlottig","id":"37392885800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1402-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-1403-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7764498","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":412},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heating","Fluids","Through-silicon vias","Cold plates","Cavity resonators","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooling","heat transfer","mass transfer","microchannel flow","microchannel plates","silicon","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-flow mode","coolant temperature","power dissipation","front-side cooling","thermal gradient","junction temperature","thermally conductive underfill","heat conduction modeling","electrical interconnect","thermal interfaces","mass transfer","heat transfer","analytical convection model","optimal microchannel dimension","embedded TSV","sealing-ring structure","interposer cavity","cross-flow heat-exchange mode","split-flow mode","back-side cold plate","back-side cooling","silicon cold plate","dual-side cooling topology","embedded fluid channel","silicon-interposer","microchannel cold plate","dual-side heat removal","size 150 mum","size 250 mum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764498","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 6th Electronic System-Integration Technology Conference (ESTC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751138/7764447/07764498.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ESTC.2016.7764498","doi":"10.1109/ESTC.2016.7764498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764447","publicationTitle":"2016 6th Electronic System-Integration Technology Conference (ESTC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-side heat removal by micro-channel cold plate and silicon-interposer with embedded fluid channels","abstract":"In this study, a dual-side cooling topology based on a silicon cold plate and an electrical functional silicon-interposer with embedded fluid channels is benchmarked against mere back-side cooling. The back-side cold plate can be operated in a split-flow mode, whereas in the case of the interposer only a single in- and outlet can be implemented, which results in a cross-flow heat-exchange mode. An interposer cavity can be achieved by back-to-back bonding of interposer shells to achieve large channel heights. Sealing-ring structures and embedded TSVs are required to prevent contact between water and the electrically active TSVs. Optimal micro-channel dimensions of 150 \u03bcm width and 250 \u03bcm height were computed using an analytical convection model that considered mass and heat transfer. The impact of thermal interfaces arising from the electrical interconnects between the chip stack and the interposer was studied by numerical heat-conduction modeling. Neither, the interconnect type, rail or pillar, nor the application of thermally conductive underfills did result in significant changes in junction temperature. However, the dual-side cooling approach resulted in twice lower thermal gradients at the inlet of the cavity than with the back-side or front-side cooling option only. Although the cross-flow mode of the interposer increases the coolant temperature more than the cold plate, dual-side cooling extends the power dissipation limit for single dies and chip stacks substantially, supporting performance and efficiency scaling.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764498/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16520144","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7764498/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dual-side heat removal by micro-channel cold plate and silicon-interposer with embedded fluid channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-side heat removal by micro-channel cold plate and silicon-interposer with embedded fluid channels","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"s21p1_95_Brunschwiler_a.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056984S","chronDate":"13-15 Sept. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751138","isNumber":"7764447","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751138","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7764447","articleId":"7764498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7764505,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Our investigations prove that our packaging approach for T-CFPA is compatible with spherical shape curving down to 280 mm radius of curvature for a 20*23 mm CMOS image sensor without performance loss. Flexible sensors offer several optical advantages. In single aperture camera, the T-CFPA technology can compensate the Petzval Field Curvature aberration, and simplify the optical design of wide field systems with about 30% less lenses. Applied on monocentric systems, a Field of View of 15\u00b0 can be imaged, and more than 50\u00b0 for a modified system. For multi-aperture optics, T-CFPA system allows a Field of View improved by more than 11\u00b0.

While most of the efforts have been directed towards building ambient and wearable sensors-assisted activity recognition based behavioral analysis models for remote health monitoring, energy analytics assisted behavioral abnormality prediction have rarely been investigated. In this paper, we propose a data analytic approach that helps detect energy usage anomalies corresponding to the behavioral abnormality of the residents. Our approach relies on detecting everyday appliances usage from smart meter and smart plug data traces in regular activity days and then learning the unique time segment group of each appliance's energy consumption. We focus on detecting behavioral anomalies over a set of energy source data points rather than pinpointing individual odd points. We employ hierarchical probabilistic model-based group anomaly detection [7] to interpret the anomalous behavior and therefore, detect potential tendency towards behavioral abnormality. We apply daily activity logs to evaluate our approach using two realworld energy datasets pertaining to staged functional behaviors, and show that it is possible to detect max. 97% of anomalous days with max. 87% of meaningful micro-behavioral abnormal events generating 1.1% of false alarms. However, we show that our detected abnormality can be meaningfully represented to different stakeholders such as caregivers and family members to understand the nature and severity of abnormal human behavior for sustaining better healthcare.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smart-energy group anomaly based behavioral abnormality detection","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Wireless Health (WH)","doi":"10.1109/WH.2016.7764554","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Wireless Health (WH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764434/7764547/07764554.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WH.2016.7764554","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764547","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764554","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764554/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Smart-energy group anomaly based behavioral abnormality detection","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764554/","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16545208","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smart-energy group anomaly based behavioral abnormality detection","confLoc":"Bethesda, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"07_0011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064197S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764434","isNumber":"7764547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764434","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7764547","articleId":"7764554","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764563,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Lemoyne","affiliation":["Department of Biological Sciences, Center for Bioengineering Innovation, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Lemoyne","id":"37601642200"},{"name":"Timothy Mastroianni","affiliation":["Independent, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Mastroianni","id":"37601641700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3090-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3091-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7764563","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tendons","Wireless communication","Gyroscopes","Accelerometers","Wireless sensor networks","Biological neural networks","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gyroscopes","learning (artificial intelligence)","medical disorders","neural nets","neurophysiology","patient diagnosis","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smartphone wireless gyroscope platform","machine learning classification","hemiplegic patellar tendon reflex pair disparity","multilayer perceptron neural network","neurological health status","clinically observed dysfunction","medical diagnostics","wireless quantified reflex system","iPhone"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764563","abstract":"The patellar tendon enables fundamental insight regarding neurological health status. Clinically observed dysfunction may warrant escalation to more advanced and expensive medical diagnostics. Conventionally clinicians apply an ordinal scale to quantify reflex response characteristics. However the reliability of ordinal scales is a subject of debate, and even highly skilled clinicians have disputed the observation of an asymmetric reflex pair. An alternative is the use of the wireless quantified reflex system, which features an impact pendulum attached to a reflex hammer for providing precisely targeted levels of potential energy with a smartphone (iPhone) equipped with software to function as a wireless gyroscope platform that can email a trial sample as an email attachment by wireless connectivity to the Internet. With notable attributes of the gyroscope signal recordings of the reflex response of a hemiplegic patellar tendon reflex pair observed a feature set is developed for machine learning classification. Using the multilayer perceptron neural network considerable classification accuracy is attained. The research implications reveal the potential of integrating machine learning with a wireless reflex quantification system that applies a smartphone (iPhone) as a wireless gyroscope platform.","doi":"10.1109/WH.2016.7764563","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764434/7764547/07764563.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Wireless Health (WH)","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Wireless Health (WH)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WH.2016.7764563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Smartphone wireless gyroscope platform for machine learning classification of hemiplegic patellar tendon reflex pair disparity through a multilayer perceptron neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764563/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Smartphone wireless gyroscope platform for machine learning classification of hemiplegic patellar tendon reflex pair disparity through a multilayer perceptron neural network","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16545207","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7764563/","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Smartphone wireless gyroscope platform for machine learning classification of hemiplegic patellar tendon reflex pair disparity through a multilayer perceptron neural network","confLoc":"Bethesda, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"18_0077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058475S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764434","isNumber":"7764547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764434","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7764547","articleId":"7764563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7764572,"authors":[{"name":"Jiaqi Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, UVA Center for Wireless Health, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA"],"lastName":"Gong","id":"37085676010"},{"name":"Myla D.

However, most studies to date have investigated the features extracted from movements of the lower limbs and do not provide a holistic gait assessment. A recent pilot study demonstrated that the holistic gait assessment such as evaluating the associations among lower and upper limbs provided better discrimination between healthy controls and PwMS. This paper is motivated by this and further aim to answer the following question: can we identify the temporal gait patterns in terms of the holistic gait assessment? Traditionally this suffers from the statistical property of the causality inference method adopted by previous study. We proposed a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the temporal and spectral associations among the time-series motion data captured by the inertial body sensors. A simulated model was developed to train the CNN, and then the trained CNN was adopted to assess the gait performance from a pilot dataset with 41 subjects (28 PwMS and 13 healthy controls). Experimental results are reported to illustrate the performance of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/WH.2016.7764572","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Wireless Health (WH)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7764434/7764547/07764572.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 IEEE Wireless Health (WH)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WH.2016.7764572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deepmotion: a deep convolutional neural network on inertial body sensors for gait assessment in multiple sclerosis*","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Legged locomotion","Pulse width modulation","Physiology","Sensor phenomena and characterization","Data processing","Machine learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body sensor networks","diseases","gait analysis","inertial systems","injuries","medical disorders","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Deepmotion","deep convolutional neural network","inertial body sensors","gait assessment","multiple sclerosis","walking impairment","chronic diseases","disorders","injuries","wearable technology","spatiotemporal features"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764572/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Deepmotion: a deep convolutional neural network on inertial body sensors for gait assessment in multiple sclerosis*","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764572/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"15 December 2016","conferenceDate":"25-27 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16545203","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deepmotion: a deep convolutional neural network on inertial body sensors for gait assessment in multiple sclerosis*","confLoc":"Bethesda, MD, USA","sourcePdf":"38_0080.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060893S","chronDate":"25-27 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7764434","isNumber":"7764547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7764434","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7764547","articleId":"7764572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7764602,"authors":[{"name":"Andrey Nasonov","affiliation":["Laboratory of Mathematical Methods of Image Processing, Lomonosov Moscow State University"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Nasonov","id":"37391615300"},{"name":"Andrey Krylov","affiliation":["Laboratory of Mathematical Methods of Image Processing, Lomonosov Moscow State University"],"firstName":"Andrey","lastName":"Krylov","id":"37411317900"},{"name":"Konstantin Chesnakov","affiliation":["Laboratory of Mathematical Methods of Image Processing, Lomonosov Moscow State University"],"firstName":"Konstantin","lastName":"Chesnakov","id":"37086045574"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2781-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2780-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2782-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2471-8963"}],"articleNumber":"7764602","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Kernel","Image edge detection","Classification algorithms","Memory management","Image resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image resolution","image sampling","interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge-directional image resampling","combined directional kernels","adaptive interpolation kernels","high-resolution pixel construction","local gradient features","low-resolution image","high-resolution image","LIVE image database","low complexity consumption","low memory consumption","edge-directional image interpolation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fast image resampling","edge-directional interpolation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764602","abstract":"A new edge-directional image resampling method is proposed.

Moreover, a secondary jammer (SJ) that harvests energy from the radio frequency (RF) signals received from the ST is used to transmit jamming signals to the SE.

time synchronization is a challenging issue in UWA-OFDM systems. In addition, the signal bandwidth of UWA communication systems is very limited. Thus, optimizing the bandwidth efficiency of the system is also an important target in designing synchronization methods for UWA communications. For combating the above-mentioned problems as well as to increase the spectrum efficiency of the system, this paper proposes a time synchronization method for OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication systems. Instead of the using preamble, we use only the guard interval (GI) for the time synchronization. Hence, there is no additional redundancy for synchronization that is requested for the proposed method. Experimental and simulation results show that the proposed time synchronization method outperforms some conventional algorithms used for UWA communication systems.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764760","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764760.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A time synchronization method for OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764760/","displayDocTitle":"A time synchronization method for OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520225","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764760/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A time synchronization method for OFDM-based underwater acoustic communication systems","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p131hung.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039435S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764761,"authors":[{"name":"Neil Irwin Bernardo","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute, University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines"],"firstName":"Neil Irwin","lastName":"Bernardo","id":"37086044327"},{"name":"Franz De Leon","affiliation":["Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute, University of the Philippines Diliman, Quezon City, Philippines"],"firstName":"Franz","lastName":"De Leon","id":"37086046214"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2711-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8767-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3760-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"7764761","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":472},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Security","Optimization","MIMO","Mathematical model","Quality of service","Power demand","Energy efficiency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","energy conservation","MIMO communication","quality of service","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eavesdropper CSI","channel state information","PHY security","quality-of-service","spatial soft-cell scheme","cellular technology","massive MIMO","energy efficiency","trade-off between physical layer security"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","Small Cell Networks","Physical Layer Security","5G"]}],"abstract":"The primary design goal in cellular technology is to provide high data rate services to its customers while still maintaining energy-efficient transmission over the network. The road to move forward is through deployment of highly densified network topologies. The emergence of these network topologies has also opened up research opportunities on how to exploit their physical layer (PHY) characteristics in order to improve the overall security. In this paper, we analyze the performance of a heterogeneous network that combines massive MIMO technology and small cell networks via spatial soft-cell scheme. An optimization model is formulated that minimizes the total power consumption of the network while satisfying certain degree of Quality-of-Service (QoS) and PHY security. Furthermore, we extend the optimization model to consider uncertainty in the eavesdroppers' channel state information (CSI). Potential tradeoff between PHY security and energy efficiency was investigated. We provide promising results showing that employing massive MIMO at the base station and placing multiple operator-deployed small cell nodes can significantly improve energy efficiency and capacity of the cellular network while providing adequate level of security, even with imperfect knowledge of eavesdropper CSI.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764761","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764761.pdf","startPage":"135","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the trade-off between physical layer security and energy efficiency of massive MIMO with small cells","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764761","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764761/","displayDocTitle":"On the trade-off between physical layer security and energy efficiency of massive MIMO with small cells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520211","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764761/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the trade-off between physical layer security and energy efficiency of massive MIMO with small cells","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p135bernardo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074826S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764761","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764763,"authors":[{"name":"Osman \u015eayli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Recep Tayyip Erdogan University, Rize, Turkey"],"firstName":"Osman","lastName":"\u015eayli","id":"37086007247"},{"name":"Hakan Do\u011fan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Avcilar, Turkey"],"firstName":"Hakan","lastName":"Do\u011fan","id":"37282432900"},{"name":"Erdal Panayirci","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Kadir Has University, Istanbul, Cibali, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Panayirci","id":"37344633800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2711-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8767-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3760-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"7764763","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":694},"abstract":"Visible Light Communication(VLC) has been considered as a potential access option for 5G wireless systems to solve performance limitation due to bandwidth shortage at radio frequency (RF) band. In (VLC) system, illumination infrastructure has dual usage at the same time namely illumination and wireless data transmission. DC Biased optical (DCO)-OFDM has been proposed for VLC systems to provide optically power efficient solution and easy implementation. Wireless communication systems generally require estimating and tracking the fading channel in order to detect transmitted data coherently. In this work, comb type pilot arrangement with interpolation and block type pilot arrangement are proposed for the DCO-OFDM systems over visible light channels.

The numerical results show that the TWDM-PON/FSO-combined system can take the advantages of both optical access networks and FSO technologies to create a promising flexible gigabit-bandwidth-capable solution for next generation mobile backhaul networks.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764770.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764770","startPage":"180","endPage":"185","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of gigabit-capable mobile backhaul networks exploiting TWDM-PON and FSO technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764770/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of gigabit-capable mobile backhaul networks exploiting TWDM-PON and FSO technologies","htmlLink":"/document/7764770/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"16520195","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of gigabit-capable mobile backhaul networks exploiting TWDM-PON and FSO technologies","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p180nguyen.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087716S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764770","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7764772,"authors":[{"name":"Ngoc-Tan Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Ngoc-Tan","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085429360"},{"name":"Quoc-Tuan Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Quoc-Tuan","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38256363300"},{"name":"Nam-Hoang Nguyen","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nam-Hoang","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085429354"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2711-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8767-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3760-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"7764772","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":245},"abstract":"Optical Multi-Input and Multi-Output (O-MIMO) is considered as an effective solution in order to achieve high performance for Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems.

The analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling speed for conventional DPD has to be several times the original signal bandwidth in order to cover the out-of-band intermodulation components caused by a nonlinear PA, which leads to use high-speed ADCs that tend to be the most expensive components in a transmitter with DPD. The emerge of concurrent dualband (multi-band) PAs, two (multiple) ADCs are needed to deal with each band separately. Eliminating the need to repeat the components for each band is essential to lower the complexity and cost of the DPD design. In this paper, a method to compensate for the nonlinearities in a nonlinear concurrent dual-band transmitter is presented. The method uses only one branch to feedback the PA output signal instead of two (multiple) branches in the conventional architecture. Thus, It allows the use of only one ADC with only one down-converter, hence making a complexity reduction for the design of the DPD. The results show that the implementation of a dual-band DPD can be simplified using the proposed approach without sacrificing the DPD accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764777","startPage":"22","endPage":"26","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764777.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplified approach to concurrent dual-band power amplifiers digital predistortion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"A simplified approach to concurrent dual-band power amplifiers digital predistortion","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764777/","accessionNumber":"16520172","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764777/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplified approach to concurrent dual-band power amplifiers digital predistortion","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p22bshara.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05075S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7764779,"authors":[{"name":"Nhan Nguyen-Thanh","affiliation":["LTCI, Universit\u00e9 Paris Saclay, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Nhan","lastName":"Nguyen-Thanh","id":"38271157200"},{"name":"Han Le-Duc","affiliation":["LTCI, Universit\u00e9 Paris Saclay, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Le-Duc","id":"37085728651"},{"name":"Duc-Tuyen Ta","affiliation":["LTCI, Universit\u00e9 Paris Saclay, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Duc-Tuyen","lastName":"Ta","id":"37085991129"},{"name":"Van-Tam Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA","LTCI, Universit\u00e9 Paris Saclay, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Van-Tam","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37290797900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2711-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8767-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3760-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"7764779","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":536},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764779","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Hardware","Radio frequency","Pipelines","Clocks","Delays","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","neural nets","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficient technique","deep convolutional neural networks","CNN","mobile devices","fast Fourier transform configuration","optimal pipeline data movement scheduling","FFT size selecting method","processing engine array","parallel flexible-length Radix-2 single-delay feedback lines","2D-FFT"]}],"abstract":"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been developed for a wide range of applications such as image recognition, nature language processing, etc. However, the deployment of deep CNNs in home and mobile devices remains challenging due to substantial requirements for computing resources and energy needed for the computation of high-dimensional convolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach designed to minimize energy consumption in the computation of convolutions in deep CNNs. The proposed solution includes (i) an optimal selection method for Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) configuration associated with splitting input feature maps, (ii) a reconfigurable hardware architecture for computing high-dimensional convolutions based on 2D-FFT, and (iii) an optimal pipeline data movement scheduling. The FFT size selecting method enables us to determine the optimal length of the split input for the lowest energy consumption. The hardware architecture contains a processing engine (PE) array, whose PEs are connected to form parallel flexible-length Radix-2 single-delay feedback lines, enabling the computation of variable-size 2D-FFT. The pipeline data movement scheduling optimizes the transition between row-wise FFT and column-wise FFT in a 2D-FFT process and minimizes the required data access for the element-wise accumulation across input channels. Using simulations, we demonstrated that the proposed framework improves the energy consumption by 89.7% in the inference case.","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764779.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764779","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient techniques using FFT for deep convolutional neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient techniques using FFT for deep convolutional neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764779/","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7764779/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520193","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient techniques using FFT for deep convolutional neural networks","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p231nguyenthanh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083573S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764780,"authors":[{"name":"Khac-Hoang Ngo","affiliation":["L2S, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, France"],"firstName":"Khac-Hoang","lastName":"Ngo","id":"37085896068"},{"name":"Sheng Yang","affiliation":["L2S, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, France"],"firstName":"Sheng","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085574147"},{"name":"Mari Kobayashi","affiliation":["L2S, CentraleSup\u00e9lec, France"],"firstName":"Mari","lastName":"Kobayashi","id":"37290906700"},{"name":"Kaibin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Kaibin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37290266200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2711-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8767-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3760-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"7764780","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":198},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Interference","Receivers","Downlink","MISO","Channel estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content delivery","coded caching","massive MIMO","downlink MIMO channel","Rayleigh quasi-static fading"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we extend the answer for the question: Do the gains from massive MIMO and coded caching cumulate? in a simple setting of downlink MIMO channel with Rayleigh quasi-static fading.

On the other hand, we show that in this setting, the combination of both provides a scalable solution in most practical scenarios. Therefore, MIMO and coded caching are indeed complementary, especially under an optimal power allocation.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764780","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764780.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","startPage":"237","endPage":"242","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the complementary roles of massive MIMO and coded caching for content delivery","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764780","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the complementary roles of massive MIMO and coded caching for content delivery","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764780/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520181","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7764780/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the complementary roles of massive MIMO and coded caching for content delivery","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p237ngo.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084132S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764780","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764782,"authors":[{"name":"Thiem V.

The approach uses Radial Basis Functions, RBF neural network. An adaptive scheme for the RBF neural network is developed to approximate unknown system functions and to estimate disturbances consisting of both approximation errors and external disturbances. An adaptive law is then applied to update the parameters of controller instead of choosing fixed controller's parameters which are coefficients of Hurwitz polynomial. Thanks to Lyapunov's theory, asymptotic stability is established with the tracking errors converging to a neighborhood of the origin. Finally, an example, coupled tank liquid system, is presented to illustrate the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764782","startPage":"247","endPage":"252","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764782.pdf","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764782","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disturbance estimation combined with new adaptive RBF neural network for uncertain system with disturbance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Adaptive systems","Estimation","Nonlinear systems","Closed loop systems","Liquids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear systems","radial basis function networks","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coupled tank liquid system","asymptotic stability","Lyapunov theory","Hurwitz polynomial","adaptive law","unknown system functions","radial basis functions","nonlinear systems","adaptive neural network controller","uncertain system","adaptive RBF neural network","disturbance estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764782/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Disturbance estimation combined with new adaptive RBF neural network for uncertain system with disturbance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764782/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520205","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Disturbance estimation combined with new adaptive RBF neural network for uncertain system with disturbance","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p247pham.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077326S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764782","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7764787,"authors":[{"name":"Francis C.

However, the power consumption has become one of the most critical issues for designing such large complex systems. Low power design can be achieved by scaling the voltage and frequency of the target components. The question is how to make the voltage-frequency scaling adaptable to the required performance of the system at run-time while reducing as much as possible the power consumption. This paper presents a novel solution for NoC architectures to reduce power consumption using fuzzy-logic algorithms. As the communication traffic is not equally distributed over the network architecture, depending on the communication load, each router in the network will be applied with a corresponding voltage and frequency to minimize the power consumption while keeping necessary communication throughput.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764801.pdf","startPage":"334","endPage":"338","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764801","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764801","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy-logic based low power solution for Network-on-Chip architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Voltage control","Radiation detectors","Power demand","Frequency control","Fuzzy logic","Computer architecture","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic","integrated circuit design","low-power electronics","minimisation","network routing","network-on-chip","performance evaluation","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power consumption minimization","network router","communication load","communication traffic","fuzzy-logic algorithms","NoC architectures","system performance","voltage-frequency scaling","low power design","single chip system","intellectual properties","network-on-chip architectures","fuzzy-logic based low power solution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy-logic based low power solution for Network-on-Chip architectures","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764801/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520159","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy-logic based low power solution for Network-on-Chip architectures","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p334phan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046043S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764801","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764803,"authors":[{"name":"Shu-Ming Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shu-Ming","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37274960000"},{"name":"Der-Feng Tseng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Der-Feng","lastName":"Tseng","id":"37369369900"},{"name":"Tsung-Ruu Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tsung-Ruu","lastName":"Tsai","id":"37709215800"},{"name":"Yunghsiang S.

A sophisticated decoder is widely known to yield a substantial performance improvement by exploiting impulse statistics; however, impulse statistics are difficult to model accurately and are generally not time invariant, likely leading the receiver complexity to be prohibitive. Based on our previous work - which proved the robustness of a soft limiter despite a lack of impulse statistics, this study incorporated a clipping operation into a single-carrier turbo-coded system in memoryless impulse noise channels. Further, the performance of the proposed decoder was evaluated according to the bit error rate to demonstrate the performance gain derived from various clipping thresholds, each of which reflects a different degree of impulse information to which the proposed decoder can leverage.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764803","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764803.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"349","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764803","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust turbo decoding in single-carrier systems over memoryless impulse noise channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Robust turbo decoding in single-carrier systems over memoryless impulse noise channels","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7764803/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520196","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764803/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust turbo decoding in single-carrier systems over memoryless impulse noise channels","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p344tseng.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064336S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764803","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7764804,"authors":[{"name":"Minh Q.

We propose an heuristic algorithm to choose the best sites to install the FSO transceivers and also the best topology for a given traffic load in a region. The algorithm aims to use the least of FSO links as possible since this allows to reduce the network costs. In addition, the algorithm takes into account the influence of turbulence, misalignment, and noise by choosing links with low bit-error rate (BER). The simulation results show that the calculation time of the proposed heuristic algorithm is much smaller than optimal integer linear programming (ILP) model. Since the proposed algorithm runs very fast, even with a large number of choices of FSO sites, it is practical to use it in building quickly a restoration communication networks for replacing a regular one after a disaster. The average BER of all links of the FSO network designed by using the proposed algorithm also meets the requirement of end-to-end BER threshold.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7764805/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","accessionNumber":"16520180","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design and optimization of FSO mesh networks over atmospheric turbulence and misalignment fading channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and optimization of FSO mesh networks over atmospheric turbulence and misalignment fading channels","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p356truong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072469S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7764806,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit Garg","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi, Delhi, India"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Garg","id":"37085678105"},{"name":"Manav R.

Erroneous feedback leads to loss in diversity for this beamforming scheme as established by the bit error rate (BER) analysis. For avoiding the loss in diversity, an improved one bit feedback based beamforming scheme is proposed which outperforms the repetition coding.

In order to solve this problem, we propose an initial acquisition scheme for WHCDM with a novel approach.

To overcome the resulting identiflability estimation problem, this paper employs basis expansion models (BEM) for reducing the number of time-varying channel impairment parameters to be estimated. Using the BEM-based approximation of the channel impairment responses, this paper formulates a pilot-aided algorithm for maximum-a-posteriori (MAP)-based estimation of the BEM coefficients. This paper provides empirical mean squared error (MSE) results of the joint channel impairment parameter estimation and related analytical values of Bayesian Cramer Rao lower bounds (BCRLB). The numerical results illustrate that the use of BEM facilitates reliable estimation of the time-varying channel impairment responses whereas the corresponding MSE and bit-error-rate (BER) values are comparable to related BCRLBs and ideal BER ones, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764817","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764817.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","startPage":"413","endPage":"418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint phase noise and doubly selective channel estimation in full-duplex MIMO-OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764817","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint phase noise and doubly selective channel estimation in full-duplex MIMO-OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764817/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520188","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7764817/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint phase noise and doubly selective channel estimation in full-duplex MIMO-OFDM systems","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p413nguyenduynhat.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085161S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764821,"authors":[{"name":"Hai Tran Hong","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam","Humax Vietnam R&D Center, Hanoi, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Hai Tran","lastName":"Hong","id":"37085994518"},{"name":"Quy Bien Xuan","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Quy Bien","lastName":"Xuan","id":"37085991764"},{"name":"Duong Doan Van","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Duong Doan","lastName":"Van","id":"37085991410"},{"name":"Nam Pham Ngoc","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Nam Pham","lastName":"Ngoc","id":"37085375480"},{"name":"Thanh Nguyen Huu","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Telecommunications, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam"],"firstName":"Thanh Nguyen","lastName":"Huu","id":"37085663375"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-2711-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-8767-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print on Demand(PoD) ISBN","value":"978-1-5090-3760-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-1039"}],"articleNumber":"7764821","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sorting","Computer architecture","Quality of service","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Throughput","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","protocols","queueing theory","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware-efficient implementation","WFQ algorithm","weighted fair queuing algorithm","NetFPGA-based OpenFlow switch","network service development","quality-of-service guarantee","QoS","NetFPGA 1G board","Xilinx Virtex II Pro 50 technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","SDN","OpenFlow","WFQ","QoS"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764821","abstract":"The development of network services makes their requirements for bandwidth become higher and more various, which leads to difficulty in Quality of Service (QoS) guarantee.

Employing the dualism of Fourier transforms, we treat spectrum samples as time-domain samples, and entire SEFDM spectrum is considered as a time-domain faster-than-Nyquist signal. This approach allows a signal detection based on the Viterbi algorithm. The computational complexity of this receiver depends linearly on a number of allocated subcarriers. A transition from sine to RRC subcarriers' spectrums leads to increase of SEFDM symbol duration in time domain. We have demonstrated by simulation that bandwidth and energy consumptions of SEFDM with RRC subcarriers' spectrums are significantly lower than the consumptions of SEFDM with sine subcarriers' spectrums under a fixed computational complexity of the receiver. In addition, we have represented the comparison of our signals with the conventional SEFDM in terms of modified energy consumptions taking a signal peak to average power ratio into account.

The basic principle in this technique is to select transmit antennas using information bits and transmit data symbols from these antennas. Obviously, SM involves symbol-rate antenna switching, which leads to serious problems and degradations in practice due to the non-rectangular pulse shaping used. Combining SM with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) leads to what we call Frequency-Domain SM (FDSM). This technique avoids antenna switching and eliminates the related problems. However, the number of RF chains required to implement it is no longer smaller than the number of transmit antennas, but the power requirements are reduced as compared to conventional MIMO/OFDM. In this paper, we investigate the requirements in terms of high-power amplifiers and we introduce a Balanced FDSM scheme, which further reduces these requirements.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7751809/7764435/07764834.pdf","startPage":"76","endPage":"79","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Advanced Technologies for Communications (ATC)","doi":"10.1109/ATC.2016.7764834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATC.2016.7764834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7764435","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7764834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency-domain spatial modulation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","OFDM","Modulation","Switches","MIMO","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","frequency-domain analysis","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency-domain spatial modulation","multiple input multiple output technique","MIMO technique","wireless communication system","transmit RF chain","transmit antenna","transmit data symbol","information bit","symbol-rate antenna switching","nonrectangular pulse shaping","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","OFDM","frequency-domain SM","high-power amplifier","balanced FDSM scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","Spatial Modulation","OFDM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7764834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Frequency-domain spatial modulation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7764834/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520155","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency-domain spatial modulation","confLoc":"Hanoi, Vietnam","sourcePdf":"p76arrano.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070001S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7751809","isNumber":"7764435","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7751809","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7764435","articleId":"7764834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7764835,"authors":[{"name":"Chuyen T.

The proposed solution allows to mitigate the relevant phase distortion (AM/PM) and gain penalty, typically registered in GaN DPAs, without worsening other key features such as back-off efficiency and amplitude distortion (AM/AM). To this purpose, a nonlinear driver stage is introduced in both Carrier and Peaking branches, with the aim to provide a chip-level phase distortion compensation mechanism. The idea is to almost zeroing the overall phase distortion by achieving, in the driver stage, an opposite AM/PM behaviour with respect to the one of the final stage. The theoretical formulation is verified presenting the design and experimental characterization of a GaN MMIC DPA for 7 GHz radio links. The chip has been developed in a commercial 0.25\u03bcm GaN power process, resulting in a 3 \u00d7 3mm2 chip area. The realized DPA shows 38 dBm of saturated output power, 16 dB of gain, and less than 3\u00b0 of phase distortion, with a power added efficiency higher than 41% in 6 dB of output power back off.","doi":"10.1109/LMWC.2016.2629972","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7260/7809128/07765023.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LMWC.2016.2629972","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7809128","startPage":"70","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High Efficiency and Low Distortion 6 W GaN MMIC Doherty Amplifier for 7 GHz Radio Links","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A High Efficiency and Low Distortion 6 W GaN MMIC Doherty Amplifier for 7 GHz Radio Links","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","isJournal":true,"volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16581569","dateOfInsertion":"09 January 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7765023/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High Efficiency and Low Distortion 6 W GaN MMIC Doherty Amplifier for 7 GHz Radio Links","sourcePdf":"lmwc-giofre-2629972-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040574S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7260","isNumber":"7809128","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7260","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7809128","articleId":"7765023","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7765025,"authors":[{"name":"Fayezeh Ghavimi","affiliation":["Department of Engineering Science, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7981437/7765025/ghavi-2635262-small.gif","p":["Fayezeh Ghavimi (S\u201913) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in\n electrical engineering from the University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran, in 2007 and 2012, respectively.

To efficiently allocate resource blocks (RBs) for M2M devices while satisfying QoS requirements, we propose group-based M2M communications, in which M2M devices are clustered based on their wireless transmission protocols, their QoS characteristics, and their requirements. To perform joint RB and power allocation in SC-FDMA-based LTE-A networks, we formulate a sum-throughput maximization problem, while respecting all the constraints associated with SC-FDMA scheme, as well as QoS requirements in M2M devices. The constraints in uplink SC-FDMA air interface in LTE-A networks complicate the resource allocation problem. We solve the resource allocation problem by first transforming it into a binary integer programming problem and then formulate a dual problem using the Lagrange duality theory. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional Greedy algorithm in terms of throughput maximization while satisfying QoS requirements, and its performance is close to the optimal design.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765025/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","volume":"66","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"17026848","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7765025/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Uplink Scheduling and Power Allocation for M2M Communications in SC-FDMA-Based LTE-A Networks With QoS Guarantees","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Taiwan Industrial Technology Research Institute","grantNumber":"M0-10309-6"},{"fundingName":"Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"104-2221-E-006-081-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uplink Scheduling and Power Allocation for M2M Communications in SC-FDMA-Based LTE-A Networks With QoS Guarantees","sourcePdf":"tvt-ghavimi-2635262-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093334S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7765025","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7765029,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Hu","affiliation":["Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7981437/7765029/hu-2635150-small.gif","p":["Hang Hu (M\u201912) received the B.S. degree in telecommunications\n engineering from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2010, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in information and\n communications engineering from the College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology,\n Nanjing, China, in 2012 and 2016, respectively.","He is currently a Lecturer with the Information and Navigation College, Air Force Engineering University,\n Xi\u2019an.

In this paper, we are concerned with the following design metrics: SU's harvested energy, SU's energy efficiency, and SU's harvesting efficiency, which is defined as the ratio of the average energy harvested by SU over its average energy consumption. We are interested in two tradeoff designs: one is the tradeoff between energy efficiency and harvested energy and the other is the tradeoff between energy efficiency and harvesting efficiency. Multiobjective optimization is used to solve the tradeoff problems. To simplify the original problems, we propose two schemes to obtain the lower bounds of the objective functions. The sensing threshold, sensing time, and transmit power of SU are jointly optimized to solve the tradeoff problems. Efficient algorithms are proposed to derive these design parameters. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, to show the two tradeoff designs, and to validate the effects of system parameters on these tradeoffs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2635150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","startPage":"6201","endPage":"6214","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07765029.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive Radio With Self-Power Recycling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765029/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7765029/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Cognitive Radio With Self-Power Recycling","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026862","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"66","issue":"7","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571100, 61631005 and 61671475"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive Radio With Self-Power Recycling","sourcePdf":"tvt-liang-2635150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100601S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7765029","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7765031,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Cai","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Miao","lastName":"Cai","id":"38017126600"},{"name":"Daoguo Yang","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Daoguo","lastName":"Yang","id":"37281508700"},{"name":"Jianlin Huang","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Jianlin","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085499392"},{"name":"Maofen Zhang","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Maofen","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37086025093"},{"name":"Xianping Chen","affiliation":["College of Optoelectronic Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xianping","lastName":"Chen","id":"37073347600"},{"name":"Caihang Liang","affiliation":["Guilin University of Electronic Technology, Guilin, China"],"firstName":"Caihang","lastName":"Liang","id":"37086200690"},{"name":"Sau Koh","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"firstName":"Sau","lastName":"Koh","id":"37422043100"},{"name":"Guoqi Zhang","affiliation":["Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands","State Key Laboratory of Solid State Lighting, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Guoqi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280056900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1943-0655"},{"format":"CD","value":"1943-0647"}],"articleNumber":"7765031","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":713},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"graphicalAbstract":{"summary":"Theoretical CS path in SUSADT.

Two types of commercial LED lamps with different capabilities of heat dissipation (CHDs) are investigated. Results show that the color coordinates of lamps are easily modified in various stress-loaded conditions, and different CHDs of lamps may play a crucial role in the various CS processes. Furthermore, the proposed statistic power model is adequate for the CS process of LED lamps.

It is a sudden and almost not predictable failure that often leads to extensive cost in terms of damages and/or delay in production lines. This study presents a promising solution that can prevent scuffing for the machinery industry in the future. To achieve this goal, a signal processing approach by means of an acoustic emission is introduced for the prediction of scuffing. An acoustic dataset was collected from metallic surfaces reciprocating under a constant load (typical conditions for semi journal bearings). The coefficient of friction values were measured during the entire experiments and were referred to as the ground truth of the momentary surface state. Based on the friction behavior, three friction regimes were defined that are running-in, steady-state, and scuffing. The present approach is based on tracking the changes in acoustic emission by means of three sets of wavelet-derived features. Those features include: 1) energy, 2) entropy, and 3) statistical information about the content of acoustic emission and the response of each feature to the different friction regimes was individually investigated. The applicability of machine learning classification and regression was studied for scuffing prediction. Both approaches were applied separately but can be unified together to increase the prediction time interval of surface failure. For classification, an extra friction regime was introduced designating as pre-scuffing and is defined as a time span of 3 min before the real surface failure. Random forest classifier was used to differentiate the features from the different friction regime. The best performance in classification of features from pre-scuffing regime reached a confidence level as high as 84%. In regression approach, the extracted features sequences were used together with random forest regressor. Our strategy allowed predicting scuffing up to 5 min preceding its real occurrence.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2016.2635082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8000716","startPage":"1541","endPage":"1553","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/8000716/07765035.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of Failure in Lubricated Surfaces Using Acoustic Time\u2013Frequency Features and Random Forest Algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765035/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7765035/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of Failure in Lubricated Surfaces Using Acoustic Time\u2013Frequency Features and Random Forest Algorithm","publicationDate":"Aug. 2017","accessionNumber":"17099266","dateOfInsertion":"03 August 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"13","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of Failure in Lubricated Surfaces Using Acoustic Time\u2013Frequency Features and Random Forest Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tii-wasmer-2635082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117569S","chronDate":"Aug.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"8000716","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8000716","articleId":"7765035","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7765038,"authors":[{"name":"William Martin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, United Kingdom"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/8038906/7765038/marti-2630689-small.gif","p":["William Martin is working toward the PhD degree in computer science\n at University College London, where he is part of the CREST centre and the UCLappA research group.

The shape of the EBG unit cell and the gap between the ground and the EBG layer are adjusted so that the antenna operates at 2.45 GHz. The proposed antenna retains its impedance matching when placed directly upon a living human subject with an impedance bandwidth of 5%, while it exhibits a measured gain of 6.88 dBi.

The original synchrosqueezing wavelet transform (SWT) can effectively improve the readability of TF representation (TFR) of signals with slowly varying IF. However, SWT still suffers from TF blurs for signals with fast varying IF. Moreover, the variable operating conditions of the aeroengine always make the vibration a signal with fast varying IF, especially when it comes to significant speed changes, which results in the obscure TFR for aeroengine vibration monitoring. In this paper, the MSWT introduces a chirp rate estimation into a comprehensive IF estimation to match the TF structure of the signals with fast varying IF and thus to achieve a highly concentrated TFR as the standard TF reassignment methods. Most importantly, the MSWT retains the reconstruction benefit like the SWT. The proposed MSWT is validated by both numerical simulation and applications in a bat echolocation signal analysis. Finally, a case study of a dual-rotor turbofan engine is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for aeroengine vibration monitoring.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matching Synchrosqueezing Wavelet Transform and Application to Aeroengine Vibration Monitoring","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","doi":"10.1109/TIM.2016.2613359","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel7/19/7805320/07765057.pdf","startPage":"360","endPage":"372","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2016.2613359","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7805320","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765057","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765057/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","displayDocTitle":"Matching Synchrosqueezing Wavelet Transform and Application to Aeroengine Vibration Monitoring","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"66","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7765057/","dateOfInsertion":"04 January 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16618098","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51605366 and 51421004"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2015CB057400"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2016M590937 and 2016T90908"},{"fundingName":"Open Fund of State Key Laboratory for Manufacturing Systems Engineering (Xi\u2019an Jiaotong University)","grantNumber":"sklms2016004"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matching Synchrosqueezing Wavelet Transform and Application to Aeroengine Vibration Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tim-chen-2613359-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.165614S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"19","isNumber":"7805320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7805320","articleId":"7765057","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7765062,"authors":[{"name":"Chetan Arora","affiliation":["SnT Centre for Security, Reliability, and Trust, University of Luxembourg, Alphonse Weicker, Luxembourg"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/32/8067629/7765062/arora-2635134-small.gif","p":["Chetan Arora received the PhD degree from the University of\n Luxembourg, Luxembourg, in 2016.

By making explicit the technical terms in a domain and providing definitions for them, a glossary helps mitigate imprecision and ambiguity. A key step in building a glossary is to decide upon the terms to include in the glossary and to find any related terms. Doing so manually is laborious, particularly for large requirements documents. In this article, we develop an automated approach for extracting candidate glossary terms and their related terms from natural language requirements documents. Our approach differs from existing work on term extraction mainly in that it clusters the extracted terms by relevance, instead of providing a flat list of terms. We provide an automated, mathematically-based procedure for selecting the number of clusters. This procedure makes the underlying clustering algorithm transparent to users, thus alleviating the need for any user-specified parameters. To evaluate our approach, we report on three industrial case studies, as part of which we also examine the perceptions of the involved subject matter experts about the usefulness of our approach. Our evaluation notably suggests that: (1) Over requirements documents, our approach is more accurate than major generic term extraction tools. Specifically, in our case studies, our approach leads to gains of 20 percent or more in terms of recall when compared to existing tools, while at the same time either improving precision or leaving it virtually unchanged. And, (2) the experts involved in our case studies find the clusters generated by our approach useful as an aid for glossary construction.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Terminology","Servers","Pipelines","Natural languages","Monitoring","Software","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language processing","pattern clustering","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural language requirements documents","mathematically-based procedure","user-specified parameters","candidate glossary terms","technical terms","clustering algorithm","automated approach","software requirements document","requirements glossary terms","glossary construction","generic term extraction tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Requirements glossaries","term extraction","natural language processing","clustering","case study research"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765062","doi":"10.1109/TSE.2016.2635134","startPage":"918","endPage":"945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/32/8067629/07765062.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8067629","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2016.2635134","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765062/","displayDocTitle":"Automated Extraction and Clustering of Requirements Glossary Terms","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2017","volume":"43","issue":"10","publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17243603","htmlLink":"/document/7765062/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001866","fundingName":"Luxembourg\u2019s National Research Fund","grantNumber":"FNR/P10/03 and FNR-6911386"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000781","fundingName":"European Research Council"},{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program","grantNumber":"694277"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated Extraction and Clustering of Requirements Glossary Terms","sourcePdf":"tse-sabetzadeh-2635134-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.286435S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2017","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"8067629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"8067629","articleId":"7765062","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7765065,"authors":[{"name":"Mao-Ruei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7845730/7765065/li-2624983-small.gif","p":["Mao-Ruei Li (S\u201916) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Department of Electrical Engineering.","His current research interests include channel coding, very large scale integration (VLSI) designs for channel coding, and mixed-signal VLSI design."]},"firstName":"Mao-Ruei","lastName":"Li","id":"37086004478"},{"name":"Chia-Hsiang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7845730/7765065/yang-2624983-small.gif","p":["Chia-Hsiang Yang (S\u201907\u2013M\u201910) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in electronics from National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, in 2002 and 2004, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA, in 2010.","He joined the faculty of the Electronics Engineering Department, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.

The GSM system uses multiple activated transmit antennas to further exploit the system transmission capacity. In this paper, we consider the GSM systems with channel diagonalization (CD-) transmitter pre-coder (TPC), channel inversion TPC, and without TPC. For each TPC scheme, the pairwise activated antenna detection discriminant and closed-form antenna detection pairwise error probability (PEP) of the GSM system are derived. We use the antenna detection PEP to calculate the analytical antenna detection symbol error rate union bound and the mutual information lower bound. We use asymptotic methods to analyze antenna detection diversity and coding gains of GSM system with or without TPC when the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Together with complexity analysis on the pre-coders and antenna detectors, we discover the CD-TPC trades the antenna detection performance for complexity reduction, while the CD-TPC scheme achieves a balance between the performance and complexity. This paper introduces methods to the performance evaluation of the GSM system, and provides a guideline for the GSM system design such as antenna configuration and TPC schemes selection.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2635127","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7879183/07765077.pdf","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1060","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7879183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2016.2635127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual Information and Error Probability Analysis on Generalized Spatial Modulation System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","displayDocTitle":"Mutual Information and Error Probability Analysis on Generalized Spatial Modulation System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765077/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"15 March 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16743405","htmlLink":"/document/7765077/","volume":"65","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of NSFC","grantNumber":"61471221"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of NSFC","grantNumber":"61321061"},{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2012CB316000"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project","grantNumber":"YETP0101"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Scientific Research Project","grantNumber":"JCYJ20150402103811554"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual Information and Error Probability Analysis on Generalized Spatial Modulation System","sourcePdf":"tcomm-an-2635127-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130426S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7879183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7879183","articleId":"7765077","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7765078,"authors":[{"name":"Chuan-Ke Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China","Laboratory of Advanced Control and Intelligent Automation for Complex Systems, Wuhan, China","Department of Electrical Engineering & Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K."],"firstName":"Chuan-Ke","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38187518000"},{"name":"Yong He","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China","Hubei key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Intelligent Automation for Complex Systems, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"He","id":"37272942500"},{"name":"Lin Jiang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering & Electronics, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37272130200"},{"name":"Min Wu","affiliation":["School of Automation, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China","Hubei key Laboratory of Advanced Control and Intelligent Automation for Complex Systems, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Wu","id":"37277240200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7765078","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1696},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability criteria","Symmetric matrices","Linear matrix inequalities","Delays","Numerical stability","Time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay systems","Lyapunov methods","stability criteria","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time-delay systems","stability analysis","bounding inequalities","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals","LKF","stability criteria","Wirtinger-based inequality","Jensen inequality","integral vectors","delay-product-type terms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","bounding inequalities","stability","time-delay system"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765078","abstract":"The bounding inequalities and the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals (LKFs) are important for the stability analysis of time-delay systems. Much attention has been paid to develop tighter inequalities for improving stability criteria, while the contribution of the LKFs has not been considered when discussing the relationship between the tightness of inequalities and the conservatism of criteria. This note is concerned with this issue. Firstly, it is proved that, when a simple LKF is applied, the stability criteria obtained by the Wirtinger-based inequality and the Jensen inequality are equivalent although the Wirtinger-based inequality is tighter. It means that the tighter inequality does not always lead to a less conservative criterion. Secondly, it is found that a suitable augmented LKF with necessary integral vectors in its derivative is required to achieve the advantage of the Wirtinger-based inequality. Based on this observation, two delay-product-type terms are introduced into the LKF to establish new stability criteria. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the equivalence statements and to show the benefit of the proposed criteria.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2016.2635381","startPage":"5331","endPage":"5336","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2016.2635381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8049551","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/8049551/07765078.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notes on Stability of Time-Delay Systems: Bounding Inequalities and Augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functionals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765078/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Notes on Stability of Time-Delay Systems: Bounding Inequalities and Augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functionals","volume":"62","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7765078/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"17205903","publicationDate":"Oct. 2017","dateOfInsertion":"26 September 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61503351, 51428702 and 61573325"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Hubei Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"2015CFA010"},{"fundingName":"111 Project","grantNumber":"B17040"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notes on Stability of Time-Delay Systems: Bounding Inequalities and Augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functionals","sourcePdf":"tac-he-2635381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083696S","chronDate":"Oct.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"8049551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"8049551","articleId":"7765078","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":7765085,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Dong","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7862316/7765085/dong-2622224-small.gif","p":["Qing Dong (S\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

The relay is equipped with a buffer, which enables the relay to receive or transmit in each time slot independent of previous time slots. As a practical constraint, source and relay can transmit only at rates taken from predefined and finite sets. Thereby, it is assumed that for each time slot, the instantaneous qualities of the two links are available. For this network, we derive the optimal scheduling of reception and transmission at the relay and the optimal rate selection at source and relay, such that the throughput is maximized. Since the optimal protocol introduces unbounded delay, we also propose a buffer-aided protocol, which limits the delay. For this delay-limited protocol, we study the achieved delay and throughput by modeling the queue at the buffer as a Markov chain. Our numerical results show that the throughputs achieved with the proposed buffer-aided protocols for discrete transmission rates are significantly larger than the throughputs achieved with conventional relaying protocols where the HD relay switches between reception and transmission in a strictly alternating manner.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07765086.pdf","startPage":"967","endPage":"981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2635142","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2635142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Buffer-Aided Relaying With Discrete Transmission Rates for the Two-Hop Half-Duplex Relay Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Throughput","High definition video","Relay networks (telecommunications)","Fading channels","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency hop communication","Markov processes","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)","set theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer-aided relaying","discrete transmission rates","two-hop half-duplex relay network","source-to-relay links","relay-to-destination links","optimal scheduling","optimal protocol","delay-limited protocol","buffer-aided protocols","HD relay switches","Markov chain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Buffer-aided relaying","discrete rates","protocols","block fading","throughput","delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Buffer-Aided Relaying With Discrete Transmission Rates for the Two-Hop Half-Duplex Relay Network","volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7765086/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668598","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Buffer-Aided Relaying With Discrete Transmission Rates for the Two-Hop Half-Duplex Relay Network","sourcePdf":"twc-wicke-2635142-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.198663S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7765086","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7765088,"authors":[{"name":"Yao-Hong Liu","affiliation":["Holst Centre/imec, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7907349/7765088/liu-2625462-small.gif","p":["Yao-Hong Liu (S\u201904\u2013M\u201909) received the Ph.D. degree from National Taiwan University in 2009.","He joined Terax Communication, VIA technology, and Mobile Devices, Taiwan, from 2002 to 2010.

A snapshot time-to-digital converter (TDC) acts as a digital sub-sampler featuring an increased out-of-range gain and without any assistance from the traditional counting of DCO edges, thus further reducing power consumption. With a proposed DCO-divider phase rotation in the feedback path, the impact of the digital-to-time converter's (DTC's) non-linearity on the PLL is reduced and improves fractional spurs by at least 8 dB across BLE channels. Moreover, a \u201cvariable-preconditioned LMS\u201d calibration algorithm is introduced to dynamically correct the DTC gain error with fractional frequency control word (FCW) down to 1/16384.

Since each mobile device is used primarily by a single user, it is possible to have a personalized recognizer that well matches the characteristics of the individual user. Although acoustic model personalization has been investigated for decades, much less work has been reported on personalizing language models, presumably because of the difficulties in collecting sufficient personalized corpora. In this paper, we propose a general framework for personalizing recurrent-neural-network-based language models (RNNLMs) using data collected from social networks, including the posts of many individual users and friend relationships among the users. Two major directions for this are model-based and feature-based RNNLM personalization. In model-based RNNLM personalization, the RNNLM parameters are fine-tuned to an individual user's wording patterns by incorporating social texts posted by the target user and his or her friends.

Both approaches not only drastically reduce the model perplexity, but also moderately reduce word error rates in n-best rescoring tests.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16598646","volume":"25","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7765093/","publicationDate":"March 2017","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Personalizing Recurrent-Neural-Network-Based Language Model by Social Network","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"104-2218-E-002-021-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personalizing Recurrent-Neural-Network-Based Language Model by Social Network","sourcePdf":"taslp-lee-2635445-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141208S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"7819571","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7819571","articleId":"7765093","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7765094,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Wang","affiliation":["Faculty of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7981437/7765094/jwang-2635161-small.gif","p":["Jie Wang (M\u201912) received the B.S. degree from Dalian University\n of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2003, the M.S. degree from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics,\n Beijing, China, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree from Dalian University of Technology in 2011, all in electronic\n engineering.","He is an Associate Professor with Dalian University of Technology.

This technique neither requires the target to be equipped with any device nor involves privacy concerns, which makes it an attractive and promising technique for many emerging smart applications. The key question of DFLAR is how to characterize the influence of the target on wireless signals. Existing work generally utilizes statistical features extracted from wireless signals, such as mean and variance in the time domain and energy as well as entropy in the frequency domain, to characterize the influence of the target. However, a feature suitable for distinguishing some activities or gestures may perform poorly when it is used to recognize other activities or gestures. Therefore, one has to manually design handcraft features for a specific application. Inspired by its excellent performance in extracting universal and discriminative features, in this paper, we propose a deep learning approach for realizing DFLAR. Specifically, we design a sparse autoencoder network to automatically learn discriminative features from the wireless signals and merge the learned features into a softmax-regression-based machine learning framework to realize location, activity, and gesture recognition simultaneously. Extensive experiments performed in a clutter indoor laboratory and an apartment with eight wireless nodes demonstrate that the DFLAR system using the learned features could achieve 0.85 or higher accuracy, which is better than the systems utilizing traditional handcraft features.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2635161","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07765094.pdf","startPage":"6258","endPage":"6267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2635161","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device-Free Wireless Localization and Activity Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Device-Free Wireless Localization and Activity Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach","volume":"66","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026880","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7765094/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765094/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61671102, 61301130 and 61401059"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"DUT16QY33"},{"fundingName":"Scientific Research Staring Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars, and Xinghai Scholars Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device-Free Wireless Localization and Activity Recognition: A Deep Learning Approach","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2635161-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089921S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"76","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7765094","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7765097,"authors":[{"name":"Leonardo Corr\u00eaa","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/8371203/7765097/corre-2635143-small.gif","p":["Leonardo Corr\u00eaa received the BSc degree in computer science\n from the Federal University of Pelotas, Brazil, in 2014.

The incorporation of problem domain knowledge is not an optional mechanism, but a fundamental feature of the Memetic Algorithms. In this paper, we present a Memetic Algorithm to tackle the three-dimensional protein structure prediction problem. The method uses a structured population and incorporates a Simulated Annealing algorithm as a local search strategy, as well as ad-hoc crossover and mutation operators to deal with the problem. It takes advantage of structural knowledge stored in the Protein Data Bank, by using an Angle Probability List that helps to reduce the search space and to guide the search strategy. The proposed algorithm was tested on 19 protein sequences of amino acid residues, and the results show the ability of the algorithm to find native-like protein structures. Experimental results have revealed that the proposed algorithm can find good solutions regarding root-mean-square deviation and global distance total score test in comparison with the experimental protein structures. We also show that our results are comparable in terms of folding organization with state-of-the-art prediction methods, corroborating the effectiveness of our proposal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Memetic Algorithm for 3D Protein Structure Prediction Problem","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2016.2635143","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/8371203/07765097.pdf","startPage":"690","endPage":"704","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2016.2635143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8371203","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765097/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June 1 2018","displayDocTitle":"A Memetic Algorithm for 3D Protein Structure Prediction Problem","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7765097/","dateOfInsertion":"04 June 2018","publicationDate":"1 May-June 2018","accessionNumber":"17822269","pubMedId":"27925594","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"FONDECYT","grantNumber":"11121288"},{"fundingName":"Basal Funds","grantNumber":"FB0001"},{"fundingName":"Chile and FAPERGS","grantNumber":"002021-25.51/13"},{"fundingName":"MCT/CNPq","grantNumber":"473692/2013-9 and 311022/2015-4"},{"fundingName":"NVIDIA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Memetic Algorithm for 3D Protein Structure Prediction Problem","sourcePdf":"tcbb-dorn-2635143-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.194708S","chronDate":"May-June 1 2018","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"8371203","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"8371203","articleId":"7765097","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7765099,"authors":[{"name":"Maxime Lecomte","affiliation":["CEA-Tech, Gardanne, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/8118264/7765099/lecom-2627525-small.gif","p":["Maxime Lecomte received the M.S. degree from the Ecoledes Mines de Saint-Etienne, Saint-\u00c9tienne, France, in 2013.

The approach makes it possible to specify constraints on the order in which the regions should be inspected by using colors to ensure that regions with the same color are inspected as a group. A key aspect is the transformation of the multiregion inspection into a clustered traveling salesman problem (CTSP). This is achieved by generating several inspection points on the medial axis of each region to increase the visibility and by grouping the inspection points into clusters. We also develop a fast branch-and-bound CTSP solver to find low-cost clustered tours.

The adoption of Moore's Law has led to developments and manufacturing of transistors with nanoscale dimensions, faster switching speeds, lower power consumption, and lower costs in recent generations of IC technology nodes. However, shrinking dimensions of wires connecting transistors have resulted in degradations in both performance and reliability, which in turn limit chip speed and lifetime. Therefore, to sustain the continuous downward scaling, alternative interconnect conductor materials to replace copper (Cu) and tungsten (W) must be explored to meet and overcome these challenges.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765105/","volume":"17","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7765105/","accessionNumber":"17485545","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On-Chip Interconnect Conductor Materials for End-of-Roadmap Technology Nodes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Chip Interconnect Conductor Materials for End-of-Roadmap Technology Nodes","sourcePdf":"tnano-vyas-2635583-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081954S","chronDate":"Jan.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"8249911","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"8249911","articleId":"7765105","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":7765109,"authors":[{"name":"Zhifei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/8013177/7765109/zhang-2634531-small.gif","p":["Zhifei Zhang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical\n engineering from the Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2010 and Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in\n 2013, respectively.

The small sample size, small interclass variation, and large intraclass variation, have brought biosignal analysis new challenges. Novel representation and classification approaches need to be developed to effectively recognize targets of interests with the absence of a large training set. Methods: Moving away from the traditional signal analysis in the spatiotemporal domain, we exploit the biosignal representation in the topological domain that would reveal the intrinsic structure of point clouds generated from the biosignal. Additionally, we propose a Gaussian-based decision tree (GDT), which can efficiently classify the biosignals even when the sample size is extremely small. Results: This study is motivated by the application of mastitis detection using low-voltage alternating current electrokinetics (ACEK) where five categories of bisignals need to be recognized with only two samples in each class. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness of the topological features as well as the advantage of GDT over some conventional classifiers in handling small dataset. Conclusion: Our method reduces the voltage of ACEK to a safe level and still yields high-fidelity results with a short assay time. Significance: This paper makes two distinctive contributions to the field of biosignal analysis, including performing signal processing in the topological domain and handling extremely small dataset. Currently, there have been no related works that can efficiently tackle the dilemma between avoiding electrochemical reaction and accelerating assay process using ACEK.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/10/8013177/7765109-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765109/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7765109/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17135456","pubMedId":"28113294","volume":"64","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Topological Analysis and Gaussian Decision Tree: Effective Representation and Classification of Biosignals of Small Sample Size","openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Topological Analysis and Gaussian Decision Tree: Effective Representation and Classification of Biosignals of Small Sample Size","sourcePdf":"tbme-zhang-2634531-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104559S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"8013177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"8013177","articleId":"7765109","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7765110,"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Maria Bianchi","affiliation":["Machine Learning Group, University of Troms\u00f8, Troms\u00f8, Norway"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/8262690/7765110/bianc-2630802-small.gif","p":["Filippo Maria Bianchi received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering, the M.Sc. degree in artificial intelligence and robotics, and the Ph.D. degree in machine learning from the Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy, in 2009, 2012, and 2016, respectively.","He was a Research Assistant with the Computer Science Department, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada.

The idea is to investigate the dynamics of reservoir neurons with time-series analysis techniques developed in complex systems research. Notably, we analyze time series of neuron activations with recurrence plots (RPs) and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), which permit to visualize and characterize high-dimensional dynamical systems. We show that this approach is useful in a number of ways. First, the 2-D representation offered by RPs provides a visualization of the high-dimensional reservoir dynamics. Our results suggest that, if the network is stable, reservoir and input generate similar line patterns in the respective RPs. Conversely, as the ESN becomes unstable, the patterns in the RP of the reservoir change. As a second result, we show that an RQA measure, called L\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">max</sub>\n, is highly correlated with the well-established maximal local Lyapunov exponent. This suggests that complexity measures based on RP diagonal lines distribution can quantify network stability. Finally, our analysis shows that all RQA measures fluctuate on the proximity of the so-called edge of stability, where an ESN typically achieves maximum computational capability. We leverage on this property to determine the edge of stability and show that our criterion is more accurate than two well-known counterparts, both based on the Jacobian matrix of the reservoir. Therefore, we claim that RPs and RQA-based analyses are valuable tools to design an ESN, given a specific problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765110/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2018","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"29","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2018","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2018","accessionNumber":"17519479","htmlLink":"/document/7765110/","pubMedId":"28114039","displayDocTitle":"Investigating Echo-State Networks Dynamics by Means of Recurrence Analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigating Echo-State Networks Dynamics by Means of Recurrence Analysis","sourcePdf":"tnnls-livi-2630802-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103326S","chronDate":"Feb.  2018","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"8262690","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"8262690","articleId":"7765110","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7765111,"authors":[{"name":"Tiezhu Yuan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7839250/7765111/yuan-2635620-small.gif","p":["Tiezhu Yuan was born in Nanyang, China, in 1989.

Theoretical formulations of the radiation fields are deduced, and factors affecting the mode distribution are identified. Because the array antenna cannot ideally generate a pure mode, two indicators, namely, the fundamental mode energy ratio and the degree of intensity deviation, are defined to evaluate the quality of the radiated vortex beams. The relationship between mode purity and the array parameters, OAM mode number and elevation angle, is shown through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. Given a threshold of mode purity, the boundary of the pure mode region is determined, and the minimum number of elements is obtained to ensure that the main lobe is located in the pure region. An X-band experimental setup for vortical radio beams is created, and the radiation field is measured to validate the theoretical results. The theoretical analysis can benefit the array design and application of vortical radio waves.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7839250/07765111.pdf","startPage":"688","endPage":"695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2016.2635620","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2016.2635620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839250","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mode Characteristics of Vortical Radio Wave Generated by Circular Phased Array: Theoretical and Experimental Results","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phased arrays","Manganese","Antenna theory","Radio communication","Apertures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vortical radio beams","OAM mode","array parameters","array antenna","mode distribution","orbital angular momentum mode","circular phased array","vortical radio wave"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Mode decomposition","mode purity","orbital angular momentum (OAM)","radio vortex","twisted wave","uniform circular arrays (UCAs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765111/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Mode Characteristics of Vortical Radio Wave Generated by Circular Phased Array: Theoretical and Experimental Results","volume":"65","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7765111/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16639060","dateOfInsertion":"01 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61571011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mode Characteristics of Vortical Radio Wave Generated by Circular Phased Array: Theoretical and Experimental Results","sourcePdf":"tap-yuan-2635620-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053642S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7839250","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7839250","articleId":"7765111","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7765112,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China","Qingdao Academy of Intelligent Industries, Qingdao, Shandong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7927824/7765112/xwang-2615130-small.gif","p":["Xiao Wang (M\u201916) received the bachelor\u2019s degree in network engineering from the Dalian University of Technology, Dalian, China, in 2011, and the Ph.D. degree in social computing from the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2016.","She is currently a Research Assistant with the State Key Laboratory of Management and Control for Complex Systems, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The bottom-up multiagent approach is applied to model the interactions between individuals, and the evolution and organization of collective cyber behaviors. The cyber message publishing behaviors in response to online topics is demonstrated in the artificial community, where each agent perceives the state of the topics and make decisions to operate on specific themes with particular message publishing mechanisms. The mechanisms are designed in line with the analysis of statistical results of 10 years data from Tianya.cn, which are further validated through the artificial community using computational experimental leverages. Experimental results illuminate that the individual's post publishing behavior is dominated by agent's psychological states, while the comment publishing behavior is more susceptible to the agent's social environment expressing the collective efforts of topics and other agents in the community. The artificial community has been used to test the impact of several factors (e.g., individual's psychological state, number of initial agents, and number of new added agents) to individual's message publishing mechanism and to cyber collective behavior patterns. It provides a software-defined social laboratory for social and cyber behavior studies with computational experimental measures.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Social network services","Publishing","Psychology","Complex systems","Web pages","Computational modeling","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multi-agent systems","psychology","social aspects of automation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial community","cyber interactive behavior","individuals psychological state","individuals social environment","multiagent approach","cyber message publishing behaviors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial community","computational experiments","cyber interactive behavior","message publishing mechanisms","multiagent-based modeling (MAM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765112","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2016.2615130","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7927824/07765112.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2615130","startPage":"995","endPage":"1006","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7927824","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of Cyber Interactive Behaviors Using Artificial Community and Computational Experiments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of Cyber Interactive Behaviors Using Artificial Community and Computational Experiments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765112/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","volume":"47","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7765112/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"June 2017","accessionNumber":"16885104","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Key Projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NNSFC)","grantNumber":"71232006, 61233001 and 61533019"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"General Program of NNSFC","grantNumber":"71472174"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of Cyber Interactive Behaviors Using Artificial Community and Computational Experiments","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wang-2615130-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122463S","chronDate":"June  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7927824","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7927824","articleId":"7765112","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":7765113,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Wei Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electrical Engineering, University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China","Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7955029/7765113/wang-2628080-small.gif","p":["Jun-Wei Wang received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics and the M.S. degree in system theory from Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China, in 2007 and 2009, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2013.","He was a Research Assistant with the Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China, from March to September in 2012, where he is currently a Post-Doctoral Fellow under the Hong Kong Scholars Scheme from February in 2016.

In the proposed design method, a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy PDE model obtained by using the sector nonlinearity method is first utilized to accurately describe the nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics of the PDE system. As only the state information at some known specified points in the spatial domain (i.e., the pointwise state information) is available for the controller design, the favorable property offered by sharing all the same premises in the fuzzy PDE plant model and fuzzy controller cannot be employed to develop the fuzzy control design method. To overcome this drawback, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxation technique is developed to enhance the stabilization ability of the fuzzy controller. Based on the T-S fuzzy PDE model, a membership-function-dependent fuzzy pointwise state feedback control design is then proposed by employing the Lyapunov technique, integration by parts, the vector-valued Wirtinger's inequality and the LMI relaxation technique, and presented in term of standard LMIs. Finally, the satisfactory and better performance of the proposed design method are demonstrated by the extensive numerical simulation results of two numerical examples.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7955029","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2016.2628080","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7955029/07765113.pdf","startPage":"1486","endPage":"1499","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2016.2628080","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Membership-Function-Dependent Approach to Design Fuzzy Pointwise State Feedback Controller for Nonlinear Parabolic Distributed Parameter Systems With Spatially Discrete Actuators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Membership-Function-Dependent Approach to Design Fuzzy Pointwise State Feedback Controller for Nonlinear Parabolic Distributed Parameter Systems With Spatially Discrete Actuators","volume":"47","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7765113/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"16969225","dateOfInsertion":"22 June 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765113/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61403026, 61473011 and 61625302"},{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Scholars Program"},{"fundingName":"General Research Fund from Research Grants Council of Hong Kong SAR","grantNumber":"11205615 and 11207714"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Membership-Function-Dependent Approach to Design Fuzzy Pointwise State Feedback Controller for Nonlinear Parabolic Distributed Parameter Systems With Spatially Discrete Actuators","sourcePdf":"tsmc-wang-2628080-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.243669S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7955029","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7955029","articleId":"7765113","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7765116,"authors":[{"name":"Vasileios Tenentes","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7765116/tenen-2626218-small.gif","p":["Vasileios Tenentes (M\u201907) received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from the University of Piraeus, Piraeus, Greece, in 2003, and the M.Sc. degree in computer science and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece, in 2007 and 2013, respectively.","He was a R&D Engineer with Siemens, Nea Kifissia, Athens and with Helic, S.A., Marousi, Athens.

The proposed technique relies on monitoring the discharge time of the virtual-power-network during standby operations, the value of which depends on the threshold voltage of the CMOS devices in a power-gated design (PGD). It does not require any distributed sensors, because the virtual-power-network is already distributed in a PGD. It consists of a hardware block for measuring the discharge time concurrently with normal standby operations and a processing block for estimating the BTI aging status of the PGD according to collected measurements. Through SPICE simulation, we demonstrate that the BTI aging estimation error of the proposed technique is less than 1% and 6.2% for PGDs with static operating frequency and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling, respectively. Its area cost is also found negligible. The power gating minimum idle time (MIT) cost induced by the energy consumed for monitoring the discharge time is evaluated on two scalar machine models using either x86 or ARM instruction sets. It is found less than 1.3\u00d7 and 1.45\u00d7 the original power gating MIT, respectively. We validate the proposed technique through accelerated aging experiments conducted with five actual chips that contain an ARM cortex M0 processor, manufactured with a 65 nm CMOS technology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765116/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"25","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16759768","dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7765116/","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Coarse-Grained Online Monitoring of BTI Aging by Reusing Power-Gating Infrastructure","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"EPSRC (U.K.)","grantNumber":"EP/K000810/1"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000836","fundingName":"Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, University of Liverpool, U.K. Experimental data used in this paper can be found at http://doi.org/10.5258/SOTON/402489"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Coarse-Grained Online Monitoring of BTI Aging by Reusing Power-Gating Infrastructure","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-tenentes-2626218-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17374S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7882729","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7882729","articleId":"7765116","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7765117,"authors":[{"name":"Hugo Serra","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Sciences and Technology, Center for Technology and Systems (CTS-UNINOVA), Caparica, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7809129/7765117/serra-2601343-small.gif","p":["Hugo Serra (S'14) was born in Lisbon, Portugal, in 1983.

In the proposed approach, the optimum virtual small cell density is obtained, so that the number of required communication links to the macrocell base stations for connecting all users directly or through small cells is minimized. It is shown that by using the proposed virtual small cell technique, the number of connections to the macrocell base stations becomes proportional to the logarithm of the user density. Since this relationship is linear in conventional cellular networks, utilization of virtual small cells can significantly increase the overall network capacity. In addition, the optimum virtual small cell density is derived for cases where the communications costs for a user-to-macrocell direct link and a small cell-to-macrocell trunk link are not the same.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2635146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2635146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07765128.pdf","startPage":"616","endPage":"619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Small Cells Formation in 5G Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Small Cells Formation in 5G Networks","volume":"21","issue":"3","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7765128/","publicationDate":"March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723201","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765128/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Small Cells Formation in 5G Networks","sourcePdf":"lcomm-behnad-2635146-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057255S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7874222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7874222","articleId":"7765128","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7765135,"authors":[{"name":"Hyuk Ryu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7765135/ryu-2627578-small.gif","p":["Hyuk Ryu (S\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Electrical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2010 and 2012, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include CMOS RF transceivers, mm-wave circuits, and all-digital frequency synthesizers.","He was a recipient of the IEEE International SOC Design Conference Design Award in 2012 and the IEEE Seoul Section Student Paper Contest Bronze Award in 2013."]},"firstName":"Hyuk","lastName":"Ryu","id":"38238902500"},{"name":"Eun-Taek Sung","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7765135/sung-2627578-small.gif","p":["Eun-Taek Sung (S\u201914) received the B.S. degree from the School of Electrical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea, in 2014, where he is currently pursuing the M.S. degree.","His current research interests include the design of low-power and energy-efficient sensor interfaces, data converters, and high-performance clock generators for wireless sensor networks."]},"firstName":"Eun-Taek","lastName":"Sung","id":"37085699566"},{"name":"Sangyong Park","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7765135/park-2627578-small.gif","p":["Sangyong Park (S\u201913) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the School of Electrical Engineering, Chung-Ang University, in 2011 and 2013, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include delta-sigma modulator, linear regulator, and front-end circuits design for the micro/millimeter wave wireless communication using CMOS technology."]},"firstName":"Sangyong","lastName":"Park","id":"38468459800"},{"name":"Je-Kwang Cho","affiliation":["System Integrated Circuits Center, IP TechnologyTeam, LG Electronics, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7882729/7765135/cho-2627578-small.gif","p":["Je-Kwang Cho (M\u201904) received the B.S. and the M.S. degrees in electronics engineering from Korea University, Seoul, South Korea, in 1998 and 2000, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA, in 2013.","From 2000 to 2005, he was an RF Circuit Design Engineer with Samsung Electronics, Kiheung, South Korea, where he designed LC-VCO-based PLLs and transmitter driver amplifiers for GSM/GPRS/EDGE transceivers.

The proposed A-FSA optimizes the number of clock counts for each frequency comparison cycle, depending on the difference between the target frequency and the PLL output frequency, as opposed to a binary frequency search algorithm (B-FSA), where the frequency search time per cycle is fixed. This eliminates unnecessary clocking times during the frequency comparison process, and thus reduces the total PLL lock time. The additional circuitry needed for A-FSA is only a simple counter controller, thus minimizing hardware overhead. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, two wideband PLLs are designed and simulated using a 65-nm CMOS technology: one with B-FSA, and the other with A-FSA. The latter achieves a lock time faster than the former by at least a factor of 2, even under worst case conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765135/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","volume":"25","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"16759744","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2017","publicationDate":"April 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7765135/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Fast Automatic Frequency Calibrator Using an Adaptive Frequency Search Algorithm","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea Funded by the Ministry of Education","grantNumber":"2013R1A1A2060885"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003621","fundingName":"MSIP, Korea, under the ITRC support Program","grantNumber":"NIPA-2013-(H0301-13-1013)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Automatic Frequency Calibrator Using an Adaptive Frequency Search Algorithm","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-baek-2627578-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07922S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7882729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7882729","articleId":"7765135","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7765136,"authors":[{"name":"Jize Jiang","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7865876/7765136/jiang-2627544-small.gif","p":["Jize Jiang received the B.Eng. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include highly reliable RHBD ASIC, high-precision linear circuit design, and power management ICs."]},"firstName":"Jize","lastName":"Jiang","orcid":"0000-0002-8889-3784","id":"37085335098"},{"name":"Wei Shu","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7865876/7765136/shu-2627544-small.gif","p":["Wei Shu received the B.Eng. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2005 and 2010, respectively.","He is currently a Senior Research Scientist with Temasek Laboratories at NTU, Singapore.

Cognitive radio and carrier aggregation (CA) have recently been proposed as promising technologies to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we investigate joint relay selection and optimal power allocation in an underlay cooperative cognitive radio with CA, taking into account the availability of multiple carrier components in two frequency bands, subject to outage probability requirements for primary users (PUs). The secondary user network employs relay selection, where the relay that maximizes the end-to-end sum rate is selected, assuming both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward relaying. The resulting optimization problems are optimally solved using convex optimization tools, i.e., dual decomposition and an efficient iterative method, allowing their application in practical implementations. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed configuration exploits the available degrees of freedom efficiently to maximize the SU rate, while meeting the PU average outage probability constraints.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2016.2635112","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7981437/07765137.pdf","startPage":"5904","endPage":"5918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2016.2635112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7981437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Carrier Aggregation for Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765137","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765137/","displayDocTitle":"Carrier Aggregation for Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"66","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17026846","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7765137/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NPRP","grantNumber":"6-1326-2-532"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Carrier Aggregation for Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-karagiannidis-2635112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.140257S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7981437","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7981437","articleId":"7765137","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7765139,"authors":[{"name":"Irfan Ahmed","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Taif University, Ta\u2019if, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7859429/7765139/ahmed-2634096-small.gif","p":["Irfan Ahmed (M\u201910\u2013SM\u201916) received the B.E. degree in electrical engineering and the M.S. degree in computer engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan, in 1999 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in telecommunication engineering from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2008.","He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow with Qatar University from 2010 to 2011, where he was involved in two research projects, wireless mesh networks with Purdue University, USA, and radio resource allocation for LTE with Qtel.

Two heuristic algorithms are designed. The proportional fairness hybrid beamforming algorithm provides the transmit precoder with a proportional fair spectral efficiency among users for the desired number of radio-frequency (RF) chains. Then, we transform the number of RF chains or rank constrained optimization problem into convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which can be solved by standard techniques. Inspired by the formulated convex SDP problem, a low-complexity, two-step, PF-relaxed optimization algorithm has been provided for the formulated convex optimization problem. Simulation results show that the proposed suboptimal solution to the relaxed optimization problem is near-optimal for the signal-to-noise ratio SNR \u2264 10 dB and has a performance gap not greater than 2.33 b/s/Hz within the SNR range 0-25 dB.

In contrast to general multiuser multiple-input-multiple-output cellular schemes, multibeam satellite architectures suffer from different challenges. First, satellite communications standards embed more than one user in each frame in order to increase the channel coding gain. This leads to the different so-called multigroup multicast models, whose optimization requires computationally complex operations. Second, when the data traffic is generated by several Earth stations (gateways), the precoding matrix must be distributively computed and meet additional payload restrictions. Third, since the feedback channel is adverse (large delay and quantization errors), the precoding must be able to deal with such uncertainties. In order to solve the aforementioned problems, we propose a two-stage precoding design in order to both limit the multibeam interference and to enhance the intra-beam minimum user signal power (i.e., the one that dictates the rate allocation per beam). A robust version of the proposed precoder based on a first perturbation model is presented. This mechanism behaves well when the channel state information is corrupted. Furthermore, we propose a per beam user grouping mechanism together with its robust version in order to increase the precoding gain. Finally, a method for dealing with the multiple gateway architecture is presented, which offers high throughputs with a low inter-gateway communication. The conceived designs are evaluated with a close-to-real beam pattern and the latest broadband communication standard for satellite communications.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2635139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2635139","startPage":"952","endPage":"966","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07765141.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Multicast Multibeam Precoding for Satellite Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Multicast Multibeam Precoding for Satellite Communications","volume":"16","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","accessionNumber":"16668632","publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7765141/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004837","fundingName":"Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovaci\u00f3n","grantNumber":"TEC2014-59225-C3-1-R (ELISA)"},{"fundingName":"Catalan Government","grantNumber":"2014 SGR 1567"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Multicast Multibeam Precoding for Satellite Communications","sourcePdf":"twc-vazquez-2635139-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08392S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7765141","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7765143,"authors":[{"name":"Konstantinos P.

The TX features learning an arbitrary channel response by sending a sweep of continuous wave, detecting power level at the receiver side, and then adapting modulation scheme, data bandwidth, and carrier frequencies accordingly based on detected channel information. The supported modulation scheme ranges from nonreturn to zero/Quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) to Pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) 16/256-Quadrature amplitude modulation(QAM). The proposed highly reconfigurable TX is capable of dealing with low-cost serial channels, such as low-cost connectors, cables, or multidrop buses with deep and narrow notches in the frequency domain (e.g., a 40-dB loss at notches). The adaptive multiband scheme mitigates equalization requirements and enhances the energy efficiency by avoiding frequency notches and utilizing the maximum available signal-to-noise ratio and channel bandwidth. The implemented TX prototype consumes a 14.7-mW power and occupies 0.016 mm2 in a 28-nm CMOS. It achieves a maximum data rate of 16 Gb/s with forwarded clock through one differential pair and the most energy efficient figure of merit of 20.4 \u03bcW/Gb/s/dB, which is calculated based on power consumption of transmitting per gigabits per second data and simultaneously overcoming per decibel worst case channel loss within the Nyquist frequency.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2016.2628049","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7888613/07765148.pdf","startPage":"1111","endPage":"1122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7888613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2016.2628049","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 16-Gb/s 14.7-mW Tri-Band Cognitive Serial Link Transmitter With Forwarded Clock to Enable PAM-16/256-QAM and Channel Response Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765148","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","displayDocTitle":"A 16-Gb/s 14.7-mW Tri-Band Cognitive Serial Link Transmitter With Forwarded Clock to Enable PAM-16/256-QAM and Channel Response Detection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765148/","publicationDate":"April 2017","dateOfInsertion":"29 March 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16775877","htmlLink":"/document/7765148/","volume":"52","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008500","fundingName":"Broadcom Foundation"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006602","fundingName":"Air Force Research Laboratory"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000185","fundingName":"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa)","grantNumber":"FA8650-15-1-7519"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 16-Gb/s 14.7-mW Tri-Band Cognitive Serial Link Transmitter With Forwarded Clock to Enable PAM-16/256-QAM and Channel Response Detection","sourcePdf":"jssc-du-2628049-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103768S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7888613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7888613","articleId":"7765148","onlineDate":"02 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7765149,"authors":[{"name":"Bashar I.

In this paper, we propose a probabilistic inference approach that permits the prediction, well in advance, of the intended destination of a tracked object and its future trajectory. Within the framework introduced here, the observed partial track of the object is modeled as being part of a Markov bridge terminating at its destination, since the target path, albeit random, must end at the intended endpoint. This captures the underlying long term dependencies in the trajectory, as dictated by the object intent. By determining the likelihood of the partial track being drawn from a particular constructed bridge, the probability of each of a number of possible destinations is evaluated. These bridges can also be employed to produce refined estimates of the latent system state (e.g., object position, velocity, etc.), predict its future values (up until reaching the designated endpoint) and estimate the time of arrival. This is shown to lead to a low complexity Kalman-filter-based implementation of the inference routine, where any linear Gaussian motion model, including the destination reverting ones, can be applied. Free hand pointing gestures data collected in an instrumented vehicle and synthetic trajectories of a vessel heading toward multiple possible harbors are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2016.2629025","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Prompt particles are a background noise in the context of induced \u03b2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">+</sup>\n activity measurement. A significant part of this background noise is produced by the \u03b3 prompt emitted during beam spill. Therefore a precise knowledge of beam time structure is crucial to control the quality of data of in-beam PET acquisitions. In other words, beam time structure determines the number of primary ions per bunch and the nuclear induced background. An experiment was performed at the National Large Heavy Ion Accelerator (GANIL) in Caen (France) using a 75 A.MeV carbon beam in order to test the use of sampling-based read-out electronics to provide a very accurate time stamping of the detected particles. The experimental set-up is constituted by a small acceptance dual head detector positioned on each side of the beam centered on target. For this cyclotron beam, the cycle is 12 MHz with a beam spill of 10 ns. If acquisition takes into account only events occurring outside the spill, we demonstrate that the energy spectrum of events is equivalent to target radiative decay spectrum obtained just after stopping the beam. For this experiment, the technique of sampling signal was chosen, allowing to provide an accurate time measurement to adjust optimal time and energy cuts on the recorded data. With the time structure of the beam spill at GANIL, taking into account all the events, including those acquired during the spill, the measured background-to-signal event ratio is 10%.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel7/7433213/7746573/07765150.pdf","startPage":"87","endPage":"95","publicationTitle":"IEEE

In this work, MIMO system is represented as dynamically related single input single output (SISO) systems. The robust and suboptimal control algorithm is based on the auxiliary loop method for disturbances compensation and suboptimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) which is applied to the simplified linearized model of the plant.

Several models are built that employ the classic, incremental and convex incremental extreme learning algorithm, and are compared to each other, as well as to other available models, in order to evaluate their approximation capability and accuracy. Along with the models, a few important features of the learning algorithms are discussed and alternative solutions are offered for some learning steps. Namely, the conducted research has clearly showed that the random selection of the hidden layer parameters significantly influences the approximation capacity of the classic extreme learning machine. The paper offers a simple solution to the problem. In addition, the research has confirmed that the incremental extreme learning machine indeed does not achieve the smallest possible approximation error due to the fact that the output parameters of the hidden nodes are not readjusted after the addition of each new hidden node. The paper also offers a simple solution to this problem. Finally, the convex incremental extreme learning machine tends to solve the accuracy problem of the incremental extreme learning machine. However, it still achieves smaller accuracy than the proposed solution in this paper. Nevertheless, the simulation results within this research show clearly that the extreme learning machine methods indeed possess the attributes of extreme simplicity, extremely good approximation performance, and extremely fast computation.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765228","startPage":"29","endPage":"36","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765228","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765220","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7761914/7765220/07765228.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network approach based on convex incremental learning machine for prediction of diffuse solar radiation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765228/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural network approach based on convex incremental learning machine for prediction of diffuse solar radiation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7765228/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16520421","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network approach based on convex incremental learning machine for prediction of diffuse solar radiation","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"PID4546325.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103353S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761914","isNumber":"7765220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761914","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7765220","articleId":"7765228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7765231,"authors":[{"name":"R.

A number of limiting factors are thought to contribute to the scaling problem over and above the simple combinatorial explosion, but the key ones relate to the lack of exploration of properly diverse protein folds, and to an acute form of \u201cdeception\u201d in the energy function, whereby low-energy conformations do not reliably equate with native structures. In this article, solutions to both of these problems are investigated through a multistage memetic algorithm incorporating the successful Rosetta method as a local search routine. We found that specialised genetic operators significantly add to structural diversity and that this translates well to reaching low energies. The use of a generalised stochastic ranking procedure for selection enables the memetic algorithm to handle and traverse deep energy wells that can be considered deceptive, which further adds to the ability of the algorithm to obtain a much-improved diversity of folds.

Therefore, various methods for the construction of Boolean functions with desired properties are of direct interest. New motivations on the role of Boolean functions in cryptography with attendant new properties have emerged over the years. There are still many combinations of design criteria left unexplored and in this matter evolutionary computation can play a distinct role. This article concentrates on two scenarios for the use of Boolean functions in cryptography. The first uses Boolean functions as the source of the nonlinearity in filter and combiner generators. Although relatively well explored using evolutionary algorithms, it still presents an interesting goal in terms of the practical sizes of Boolean functions. The second scenario appeared rather recently where the objective is to find Boolean functions that have various orders of the correlation immunity and minimal Hamming weight. In both these scenarios we see that evolutionary algorithms are able to find high-quality solutions where genetic programming performs the best.</para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"02 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765316/","volume":"24","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary Algorithms for Boolean Functions in Diverse Domains of Cryptography","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary Algorithms for Boolean Functions in Diverse Domains of Cryptography","sourcePdf":"evco_a_00190.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028705S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","isNumber":"7765311","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720222","citationCount":"5","articleId":"7765316","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7765346,"authors":[{"name":"Wissam Abdessamad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Wissam","lastName":"Abdessamad","id":"37086121635"},{"name":"Youssef Nasser","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Youssef","lastName":"Nasser","id":"37294663300"},{"name":"Karim.

Massive MIMO consists of tens or hundreds of antennas, which will result in an increase in capacity, reliability and performance. However, massive MIMO is facing many obstacles in terms of complexity due to the large number of antennas. In this paper, sparse code multiple access (SCMA) is introduced in MIMO systems. The interests of MIMO- SCMA resides in the need of lower number of antennas while preserving the system capacity thanks to the overload in SCMA.

However, their ad-hoc nature, the expected great density of deployment and their closed registration policy may result in multi-layered networks with base stations' ranges constantly overlapping and non-registered users struggling from the accumulative interference. In this paper, we propose a mechanism where femtocells operate in clusters, and may decide to turn to sleep mode if capacity demand of its users is met adequately by the remaining awake femtocells. We propose a special version of hybrid access targeting only users of neighboring femtocells, in order to reduce the number of active base stations and thus, to reduce interference. We enforce sleep mode under conditions that ensure the increased throughput of each involved registered user and the increased capacity provided by the entire cluster with the extra benefit of reduced energy.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765347","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7761914/7765220/07765347.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765347","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765220","startPage":"141","endPage":"146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sleep mode performance gains in 5G femtocell clusters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765347","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sleep mode performance gains in 5G femtocell clusters","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765347/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520462","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7765347/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sleep mode performance gains in 5G femtocell clusters","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"PID4546383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053026S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761914","isNumber":"7765220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761914","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7765220","articleId":"7765347","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7765353,"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Magueta","affiliation":["DETI, University of Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Magueta","id":"37085377838"},{"name":"Daniel Castanheira","affiliation":["DETI, University of Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Castanheira","id":"37860170800"},{"name":"Ad\u00e3o Silva","affiliation":["DETI, University of Aveiro, Portugal"],"firstName":"Ad\u00e3o","lastName":"Silva","id":"37401627600"},{"name":"Rui Dinis","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunicacoes, Univ.

We consider that both the transmitter and the received are equipped with a large antenna array and the number of radio frequency (RF) chains is lower that the number of antennas. The analog and digital parts of the equalizer are jointly optimized using as a metric the mean square error (MSE) between the transmitted data vector and its estimate after the digital equalizer. The specificities of the analog domain impose several constraints in the joint optimization. To efficiently deal with the constraints the analog part is selected from a dictionary based on the array response vectors. Our performance results have shown that the performance of the hybrid iterative space equalizer is close to the fully digital counterpart after only a few iterations. Moreover, it clearly outperforms the linear receivers recently proposed for hybrid mmW massive MIMO architectures.","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765353","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7761914/7765220/07765353.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non linear space-time equalizer for single-user hybrid mmWave massive MIMO systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765353","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765353/","displayDocTitle":"Non linear space-time equalizer for single-user hybrid mmWave massive MIMO systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520420","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7765353/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non linear space-time equalizer for single-user hybrid mmWave massive MIMO systems","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"PID4546401.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066292S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761914","isNumber":"7765220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761914","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7765220","articleId":"7765353","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7765354,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Meanwhile, a number of specific research challenges have to be addressed to convert the theoretical estimations into commercially attractive solutions. Due to the diversity of the challenges, the research on THz communications at its early stages was mostly performed by independent communities from different areas. Therefore, the existing knowledge in the field is substantially fragmented. In this paper, an attempt to address this issue and provide a clear and easy to follow introduction to the THz communications is performed. A review on the state-of-the-art in THz communications research is given by identifying the target applications and major open research challenges as well as the recent achievements by industry, academia, and the standardization bodies. The potential of the THz communications is presented by illustrating the basic tradeoffs in typical use cases.

Generally, most of the previous work directly analyzes the data through the existing mining approaches, which may cause problems such as redundant computation, high time complexity, and large storage space. Based on this argument, a novel heuristic approach called PASS (Pre-processing based on Small Sample) has been proposed for finding a small sample composed of the most frequent transactions in big data pre-processing. Taking advantage of the cloud computing which can solve the bottleneck of data mining in distributed environment, PASS directly operates on the transaction database and groups all transactions according to different dimensions. By using the Bitmap-Sort, the most frequent transactions can be screened from each transaction set. Finally, the best-transaction-set is obtained through aggregating all the transaction-elects of each transaction set. The experimental results have shown that PASS significantly avoids producing plenty of candidate sets resulting from join operation, accelerates the maximal frequent itemsets mining, economizes the storage space, and improves the utilization rate of resources simultaneously.","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7761914/7765220/07765363.pdf","startPage":"235","endPage":"239","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765363","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765363","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765220","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Explore maximal frequent itemsets for big data pre-processing based on small sample in cloud computing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Itemsets","Nickel","Accidents","Ions","Maintenance engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data","cloud computing","data mining","resource allocation","storage management","transaction processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Big Data preprocessing","data mining","heuristic approach","preprocessing based on small approach","PASS approach","cloud computing","distributed environment","transaction database","Bitmap-Sort method","best-transaction-set","maximal frequent itemset mining","storage space","resource utilization rate improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Big data","best-transaction-set","cloud computing","data mining","maximal frequent itemsets","small sample"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Explore maximal frequent itemsets for big data pre-processing based on small sample in cloud computing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7765363/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520475","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Explore maximal frequent itemsets for big data pre-processing based on small sample in cloud computing","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"PID4546433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093741S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761914","isNumber":"7765220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761914","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7765220","articleId":"7765363","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7765383,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Broulim","affiliation":["Czech Technical University, Czech Republic","University of West Bohemia"],"firstName":"Jan","lastName":"Broulim","id":"38548309500"},{"name":"Vjaceslav Georgiev","affiliation":["Czech Technical University, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Vjaceslav","lastName":"Georgiev","id":"37603084200"},{"name":"Nikolaos V.

The closed-form outage probability of the SM system with TAS is derived in Nakagami-m channels for arbitrary values of m.

It can be done by location more frequency subcarriers in same occupied frequency bandwidth. Our approach is increasing duration of signals for fixed data rate in contrast to \u201cclassic\u201d SEFDM signals. Fixed data rate results in significant interference in time domain - ISI. But ISI can be controlled by cross-correlation coefficient. Mutual interference of neighboring subcarriers (ICI) is compensated by application of frequency spacing as minimal value of zeros of energy spectrum. Envelopes for these signals can be obtained by optimization task. Disadvantage of optimal SEFDM signals is high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). So we must determine influence of input power backoff on BER performance. We use \u201cTotal degradation\u201d (TD) as metric for energy efficiency examination. It is shown that minimum value of TD corresponds to IBO from the interval [0; 1] dB for optimal SEFDM signals.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765401","publicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 8th International Congress on Ultra Modern Telecommunications and Control Systems and Workshops (ICUMT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7761914/7765220/07765401.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"450","doi":"10.1109/ICUMT.2016.7765401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influence of input power backoff of nonlinear power amplifier on ber performance of optimal SEFDM signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","displayDocTitle":"Influence of input power backoff of nonlinear power amplifier on ber performance of optimal SEFDM signals","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7765401/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16520418","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765401/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influence of input power backoff of nonlinear power amplifier on ber performance of optimal SEFDM signals","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"PID4546575.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05178S","chronDate":"18-20 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761914","isNumber":"7765220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761914","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7765220","articleId":"7765401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7765525,"authors":[{"name":"Marcel Robeer","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Robeer","id":"37086203098"},{"name":"Garm Lucassen","affiliation":["Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University"],"firstName":"Garm","lastName":"Lucassen","id":"37085405817"},{"name":"Jan Martijn E.

EARS has proved popular with practitioners for numerous reasons. It is lightweight, easy to learn and easy to use. It helps authors to write clear, simple requirements that are easy to read and easy to check for errors. In this paper, four experienced EARS practitioners reflect on their experiences of applying the approach in numerous projects in diverse domains over a six year period. The paper provides an overview of the types of project in which EARS was implemented and describes the deployment methods used. During the course of these projects, numerous lessons were learned. The EARS practitioners discussed the lessons to reduce bias and to ensure the generalizability of the results. These include eleven general lessons concerning requirements engineering, elicitation and natural language specification. The main contribution of the paper is the eight key EARS-specific lessons learned during these deployments. These lessons learned are generalized and will scale to any EARS deployment.

The requirements SME provided constructive and detailed feedback on defects in the requirements and then assisted the author with rewrites to remove them. This iterative process produced high-quality requirements but only after multiple revisions of requirements sets. The technique works well if there are only a few authors. However, what happens when there are dozens or hundreds of requirements authors? One requirements SME cannot possibly mentor that many authors.

OFDM uses N parallel streams to ensure high-rate data transmission. Distinct carriers are used to transmit data streams. In OFDM subcarriers are orthogonal in order to ensure that receiver can distinguish separate signals carried by different subcarriers. Generally there are three approaches in estimating channel transfer function in systems that use OFDM, pilot symbols, scattered pilot tones and eigenvalue-decomposition-based methods. Pilot symbols are mainly used for initial channel estimation. Scattered pilot tones are used to help track changes in channels over time. The complexity of the first two methods can be reduced with the eigenvalue-decomposition-based methods. In recent studies multiple channel estimation techniques, mostly based on pilot patterns stemmed from initial estimation techniques.

The most important research is done in the domain of cooperative intelligent transport system (C-ITS). Only minor attention has been given to coordinated maneuvering, since testing with real vehicles which can drive autonomously requires a large-scale infrastructure with important security measures. In this paper, we propose hybrid automaton modelling in Matlab/Simulink/ Stateflow to emulate flexible platooning conditions, analysing how cooperation interactions can be accomplished using inter-vehicle communication and certain control of the vehicles. Such analysis reveals to be necessary in order to establish the improvement of traffic mobility in Intelligent Transportation Systems through cooperation behaviour profile prediction. This study presents an approach towards NARX neural network prediction of flexible Platooning maneuvers profile. In order to estimate prediction, MSE and R were utilized. The study results suggest that in the case of noise in test data, NARX neural network would be an efficient prediction tool, and useful for the prediction mobility in Intelligent Transport systems.","doi":"10.1109/SST.2016.7765675","startPage":"287","endPage":"292","publicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Smart Systems and Technologies (SST)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SST.2016.7765675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765608","displayPublicationTitle":"2016 International Conference on Smart Systems and Technologies (SST)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7761917/7765608/07765675.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prediction of cooperative platooning maneuvers using NARX neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765675/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Prediction of cooperative platooning maneuvers using NARX neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7765675/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"16520633","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2016","conferenceDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prediction of cooperative platooning maneuvers using NARX neural network","confLoc":"Osijek, Croatia","sourcePdf":"012-41-287-292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082873S","chronDate":"12-14 Oct. 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7761917","isNumber":"7765608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7761917","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7765608","articleId":"7765675","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7765819,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We suppose that a given pattern can be represented as a Fourier-Stieltjes transform of a cumulative current distribution over a finite (normalized) aperture interval, which we then approximate by a step-function distribution whose \u201ctreads and risers\u201d are determined as follows. The moments of the step-distribution are equated to the moments of the continuous distribution belonging to the given pattern, producing a set of nonlinear equations for the positions (treads) and amplitudes (risers) of the steps. The former turn out to be roots of an orthogonal polynomial, of degree equal to number of array elements, belonging to the (continuous) cumulative distribution; the latter can then be found from a resulting set of linear equations and are the so-called Christoffel numbers. An equivalent development, which helps to illuminate the basic ideas, is to approximate the kernel of the Fourier-Stieltjes transform by a Lagrange interpolation polynomial. Both of these approaches will produce, in general, an array factor with both nonuniform spacings and amplitudes, and will be said to be optimum in a moment sense: i.e., the original distribution and its approximation agree in their first 2M moments if M is the number of elements used for the approximation. The equivalence of the moment and interpolation methods implies a mean-sguare minimality for the polynomial factor of an error representation for the latter method. But the remaining factor of the error representation involves a parameter which cannot in general be determined explicitly; this error form is therefore of little use for large apertures (compared to the number of elements involved). Practical application of moment synthesis would therefore have to rely for an error assessment largely upon either statistical estimation or pattern computation. These facts notwithstanding, the moment method can be used to produce remarkable pattern approximations in the near main-beam region, and, if the number of elements is sufficiently large, acceptable pattern behavior everywhere. Its chief drawback is that a large number of elements requires the computation of zeros of a correspondingly large degree polynomial.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Finite element analysis","Transforms","Apertures","Method of moments","Antenna arrays","Chebyshev approximation"]}],"doi":"10.1002/rds196727721","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7765938/07765946.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rds196727721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moment synthesis of array factors with nonuniform spacing and amplitude parameters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7765946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","displayDocTitle":"Moment synthesis of array factors with nonuniform spacing and amplitude parameters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765946/","volume":"2","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 1967","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1967","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moment synthesis of array factors with nonuniform spacing and amplitude parameters","sourcePdf":"rds196727721.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018259S","chronDate":"July  1967","isNumber":"7765938","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7765946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7765948,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas A.

To insure a fairly realistic simulation, allowance is made for the following factors: a spherical earth and ionosphere, electron density variations with height and range, absorption which varies with range and ray angle, antenna gain as a function of azimuth and elevation, ground scattering and specular reflection characteristics which vary with range and angle of incidence, and the transmitted pulse shape. The main approximations are (a) that ray theory is used with the assumption that most energy is distributed uniformly between closely spaced ray paths, and (b) that the effect of the geomagnetic field on ray-path range and transit time is neglected. This computer simulation has two main applications. First, it permits the study of idealized backscatter problems by controlled variation of one parameter at a time. For example, a localized irregularity may be inserted in the ionosphere and the backscatter can be calculated with and without it. Second, it is possible to match experimental backscatter with synthetic backscatter for the purpose of evaluating the ground-scatter coefficient or estimating the existing ionospheric structure. This process requires carefully calibrated experimental data because the comparison must be quantitative. Some early results of this work are shown.","doi":"10.1002/rds196727739","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1002/rds196727739","startPage":"739","endPage":"745","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7765938/07765948.pdf","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7765938","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation of HF ground backscatter amplitude","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  1967","displayDocTitle":"Computation of HF ground backscatter amplitude","publicationDate":"July 1967","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","volume":"2","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7765948/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation of HF ground backscatter amplitude","sourcePdf":"rds196727739.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024633S","chronDate":"July  1967","isNumber":"7765938","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7765948","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7766664,"authors":[{"name":"David C.

Past efforts are limited in that analytical approaches require simple refractive index profiles and computer ray tracing usually does not include the crucial boundary condition that rays have to hit the receiver with adequate accuracy. We describe a three-dimensional computer program that finds all the important rays converging on the receiver within 2 \u00d7 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u2212-6</sup>\n m. We obtain the angles of launch and arrival, the ray trajectories, and the divergence or convergence factor of each ray intensity. A complex vector differential equation is also solved for the electric field polarization components from which we calculate the attenuation and depolarization. We include antenna amplitude and phase copolar and cross-polar patterns. The potentiality of the computer program is illustrated for two refractive index profiles and varying receiver height assuming zero earth curvature. The first profile has a transition in refractive index at an elevated layer of about 300 m. Angles of arrival approaching \u00b11\u00b0 off boresight and time delays up to 19 ns are possible. The second profile has a transition in the refractive index gradient at a low-altitude layer of 70 m. As the receiver height is changed from 40 to 80 m, rays appear, disappear, and coalesce. When rays coalesce, they also converge, and this leads to enhanced fields. We find that the depolarization is strongly dependent on the ground-reflected rays for circular polarization and on the antenna patterns for all polarizations. Interference due to other rays is consequential. The divergence factor and the phases of the antennas are also important parameters.","doi":"10.1029/RS017i005p01133","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7767926/07767950.pdf","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS017i005p01133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7767926","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer modeling of multipath propagation: Review of ray-tracing techniques","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7767950","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  1982","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1982","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7767950/","displayDocTitle":"Computer modeling of multipath propagation: Review of ray-tracing techniques","volume":"17","issue":"05","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1982","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer modeling of multipath propagation: Review of ray-tracing techniques","sourcePdf":"rds2016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072457S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1982","isNumber":"7767926","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"7","articleId":"7767950","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7767964,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey S.

To clarify the physical mechanism of such anomalous scattering, this paper deals with the two-dimensional case, such that a TM plane wave is incident on the perfectly conductive Gaussian random surface. By a probabilistic method a stochastic wave solution involving multiple scattering is obtained and is shown to have a pole and a zero on the complex wave number plane. The complex pole and zero represent the existence of the guided complex wave (leaky wave) propagating along the random surface. It is concluded that the anomalous scattering is physically caused by the existence of the guided complex wave and can occur strongly in the case of a slightly rough and gently sloping surface. Several properties of the scattering are illustrated in the figures, such as the amplitude and the phase of the coherent reflection, the variance of the wave field, the optical theorem, the angular distribution of the incoherent scattering, and the backscattering cross section.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7768075/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1982","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1982","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"17","issue":"03","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1982","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Anomalous scattering from a slightly random surface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anomalous scattering from a slightly random surface","sourcePdf":"rds1959.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029039S","chronDate":"May-June  1982","isNumber":"7768063","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7768075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1982","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7768130,"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-799X"}],"articleNumber":"7768130","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7768130","abstract":"No abstract is available.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7768096","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7768096/07768130.pdf","doi":"10.1029/RS017i006p01671","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS017i006p01671","startPage":"1671","endPage":"1671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correction to \u2018Pulse-to-pulse correlation in satellite radar altimeters\u2019 by Edward J.

Thus in ordinary cases, only twenty to thirty terms give satisfactory results, and even a $100 pocket calculator can solve practical problems which are not so easy by the usual method. Second, the wave propagation in dispersive media is studied by using the above method. This problem has been investigated analytically by many authors. The problem is so difficult that there has been no detailed solution available other than asymptotic expressions. Some detailed numerical results by our method are given for the transient phenomena in a waveguide and the medium discussed by Sommerfeld and Brillouin. Our numerical results show that Brillouin's results should not be taken quantitatively except the first forerunner whose approximate variation is predicted by Sommerfeld correctly.","doi":"10.1029/RS016i006p01015","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7768420/07768430.pdf","startPage":"1015","endPage":"1019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS016i006p01015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7768420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Numerical inversion of Laplace transform and some applications to wave optics","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7768430","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.-Dec.  1981","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1981","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7768430/","displayDocTitle":"Numerical inversion of Laplace transform and some applications to wave optics","volume":"16","issue":"06","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1981","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Numerical inversion of Laplace transform and some applications to wave optics","sourcePdf":"rds1837.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052399S","chronDate":"Nov.-Dec.  1981","isNumber":"7768420","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"49","articleId":"7768430","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1981","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":7768443,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The variation of the average level of scintillation at each observatory is studied as a function of time of day, season, and magnetic activity in a manner suitable for incorporation into statistical models of scintillation occurrence. The most prominent feature of the data is a seasonal dependence of scintillations with a 2:1 variation from northern summer to winter under quiet magnetic conditions. This also causes a large variation in the latitudinal gradient of scintillations from 2 dB per degree in summer to 1 dB per degree in winter for latitudes >60\u00b0 invariant. The observed seasonal control of scintillations is related to the variation of the tilt angle of the earth's magnetic dipole and consequent modulation of the particle precipitation in the North Atlantic sector of the auroral oval.","doi":"10.1029/RS015i001p00059","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7768733","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS015i001p00059","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7768733/07768741.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"70","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The morphology of high-latitude VHF scintillation near 70\u00b0W","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.-Feb.  1980","displayDocTitle":"The morphology of high-latitude VHF scintillation near 70\u00b0W","volume":"15","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1980","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1980","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7768741/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The morphology of high-latitude VHF scintillation near 70\u00b0W","sourcePdf":"rds1619.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042014S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  1980","isNumber":"7768733","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7768741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1980","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":7768830,"authors":[{"name":"Richard M.

We present here our approach to \u201cunwrapping\u201d the 2\u03c0 ambiguities in the two-dimensional data set. We find that noise and geometrical radar layover corrupt our measurements locally, and these local errors can propagate to form global phase errors that affect the entire image.

We present a rectified digital topographic map derived from our unwrapped phase values.","doi":"10.1029/RS023i004p00713","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/RS023i004p00713","startPage":"713","endPage":"720","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7768806/07768830.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7768806","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Satellite radar interferometry: Two-dimensional phase unwrapping","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7768830/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July-Aug.  1988","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"July-Aug.  1988","displayDocTitle":"Satellite radar interferometry: Two-dimensional phase unwrapping","volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1988","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Satellite radar interferometry: Two-dimensional phase unwrapping","sourcePdf":"rds2894.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019632S","chronDate":"July-Aug.  1988","isNumber":"7768806","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","citationCount":"438","articleId":"7768830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1988","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":7769042,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Ten hand gestures used on commercial trackpads, including pinch, stretch, swipe left, swipe right, scroll up, scroll down, single click, double click, pat, and ok, can be recognized in real time. Features from four differential EMG channels are extracted in multiple time windows. Unlike traditional data segmentation methods, an event-driven method is proposed, with the gesture event detected in the hardware. Feature extraction is triggered only when an event is detected, minimizing computation, memory, and system power. A time-delayed artificial neural network (ANN) is used to predict the gesture from the transient EMG features instead of traditional steady-state features. The ANN is implemented in the microcontroller with a processing time less than 0.2 ms. The detection results are sent wirelessly to a computer. The device weights 15.2 g. A 4.6 g battery supports up to 40 h continuous operation. To our knowledge, this brief shows the first real-time, embedded hand-gesture-recognition system using only transient EMG signals.

clinical archives, research literature, and clinical manuals, coupled with recent advances in computer vision offer the opportunity for image-based diagnosis, teaching, and biomedical research. However, the content and semantics of an image can vary depending on its modality and as such the identification of image modality is an important preliminary step. The key challenge for automatically classifying the modality of a medical image is due to the visual characteristics of different modalities: some are visually distinct while others may have only subtle differences. This challenge is compounded by variations in the appearance of images based on the diseases depicted and a lack of sufficient training data for some modalities. In this paper, we introduce a new method for classifying medical images that uses an ensemble of different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. CNNs are a state-of-the-art image classification technique that learns the optimal image features for a given classification task. We hypothesise that different CNN architectures learn different levels of semantic image representation and thus an ensemble of CNNs will enable higher quality features to be extracted. Our method develops a new feature extractor by fine-tuning CNNs that have been initialized on a large dataset of natural images. The fine-tuning process leverages the generic image features from natural images that are fundamental for all images and optimizes them for the variety of medical imaging modalities. These features are used to train numerous multiclass classifiers whose posterior probabilities are fused to predict the modalities of unseen images. Our experiments on the ImageCLEF 2016 medical image public dataset (30 modalities; 6776 training images, and 4166 test images) show that our ensemble of fine-tuned CNNs achieves a higher accuracy than established CNNs. Our ensemble also achieves a higher accuracy than methods in the literature evaluated on the same benchmark dataset and is only overtaken by those methods that source additional training data.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7839252/07769199.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"40","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ensemble of Fine-Tuned Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Image Classification","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2016.2635663","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7839252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2016.2635663","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769199","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769199/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","displayDocTitle":"An Ensemble of Fine-Tuned Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Image Classification","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16638888","pubMedId":"28114041","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"21","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7769199/","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000163","fundingName":"ARC"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ensemble of Fine-Tuned Convolutional Neural Networks for Medical Image Classification","sourcePdf":"jbhi-kim-2635663-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085904S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7839252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"207","xplore-issue":"7839252","articleId":"7769199","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7769200,"authors":[{"name":"Haibo Zhang","affiliation":["Chongqing Key Lab of Mobile Communications Technology, Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Chongqing, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7769200/zhang-2635938-small.gif","p":["Haibo Zhang received the Ph.D. degree in signal and information processing from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, in 2013.

Macro networks may share spectrum with overlaid femtocells so as to improve spectral efficiency. However, the deployment of femtocells also brings co-tier and cross-tier interferences, which will significantly degrade system performance. In order to solve this problem efficiently, we propose a distributed scheme to manage wireless resources in this heterogeneous networks. The feasible solution can be obtained by dividing the problem into two sub-problems. First, we propose a femtocells clustering scheme, which uses a mathematical modeling idea based on LINGO, an optimization software that can solve the joint clustering problem for the femtocell access points (FAPs). The proposed branch-and-bound algorithm and the simplex algorithm are used jointly to find the optimal solution by LINGO. The optimality of the proposed clustering algorithm is verified both theoretically and through simulations where the comparison with other algorithms is made. Second, a novel algorithm is proposed to allocate sub-channels to the femtocell users (FUEs). Compared with other related schemes, the proposed channel-allocation algorithm can reduce the interference more effectively and achieve higher data-rate fairness among FUEs. Specifically, according to the situation that the FUEs move in the room, the FUE mobility model is proposed to predict the change tendency of path loss values of the FUEs, which can guarantee the mobile service quality and improve system capacity effectively. Finally, the power of the FAPs is adjusted dynamically through setting the interference threshold to further improve the performance of the system.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2635938","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07769200.pdf","startPage":"8643","endPage":"8656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2635938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster-Based Resource Allocation for Spectrum-Sharing Femtocell Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769200","topic":"Future Networks: Architectures, Protocols, and Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769200/","displayDocTitle":"Cluster-Based Resource Allocation for Spectrum-Sharing Femtocell Networks","volume":"4","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16587983","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7769200/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Nature Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301122, 61271260 and 61572231"},{"fundingName":"Program for Changjiang Scholars and Innovative Research Team in the University of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"IRT16R72"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100005230","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation Project of Chongqing","grantNumber":"cstc2014jcyjA40052"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Shaanxi Province","grantNumber":"2016KW-032"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Cluster-Based Resource Allocation for Spectrum-Sharing Femtocell Networks","sourcePdf":"access-song-2635938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151918S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7419931","topics":["Future Networks: Architectures, Protocols, and Applications"],"articleId":"7769200","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7769214,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Bagheri","affiliation":["School of Industrial Engineering and Management, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/8012582/7769214/baghe-2635098-small.gif","p":["Ali Bagheri (S\u201916) received the B.S. degree in applied\n mathematics from the Yazd University, Yazd, Iran, in 2005 and the M.S. degree in industrial engineering from\n Mazandaran University of Science and Technology, Babol, Iran, in 2008.

The uncertainty and variability of renewable energy and their sitting call for strategic and economic plans for expanding the transmission capacities. In this study, we develop a data-driven two-stage stochastic transmission expansion planning with uncertainties. In the proposed approach, purely by learning from the historical data, we first construct a confidence set for the unknown distribution of the uncertain parameters. Then, we develop a two-stage data-driven transmission expansion framework, by considering the worst-case distribution within the constructed confidence set, so as to provide a reliable while economic transmission planning decision. Furthermore, to tackle the model complexity, we propose a decomposition framework embedded with Benders' and Column-and-Constraint generation methods. We implement our approach on 6-bus and 118-bus systems to test its effectiveness. Finally, we show as the amount of historical data grows, the conservativeness of the model decreases.","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/59/8012582/7769214-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7769214/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2017","accessionNumber":"17121877","volume":"32","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Data-Driven Stochastic Transmission Expansion Planning","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100006130","fundingName":"(DOE)'s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Data-Driven Stochastic Transmission Expansion Planning","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-zhao-2635098-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095281S","chronDate":"Sept.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"8012582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"8012582","articleId":"7769214","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-25"},{"_id":7769216,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Shen","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7419931/7769216/shen-2635677-small.gif","p":["Hong Shen (S\u201911\u2013M\u201914) received the B.E., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2009, 2011, and 2014, respectively, all in information and communication engineering.

First, we rigorously prove the asymptotic optimality of the maximum-ratio combining/maximum-ratio transmission (MRC/MRT) relaying strategy by taking into account the massive MIMO setup. Then, concerning the equivalent optimization problem with respect to source beamformer, we advocate a two-tier iterative algorithm relying on bi-section search, which guarantees a globally optimal solution. As a byproduct of this approach, we show that the optimal source beamformer has an interesting generalized channel matching structure associated with both source-relay and source-destination links. In addition to the optimal design, we devise a high SNR approximation-based suboptimal scheme, which admits a closed-form solution. Simulation results verify the advantage of our full-duplex relaying designs, and also demonstrate a negligible performance gap between the proposed optimal and suboptimal methods.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2635677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07769216.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2635677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","startPage":"8857","endPage":"8864","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transceiver Optimization for Full-Duplex Massive MIMO AF Relaying With Direct Link","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769216","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Transceiver Optimization for Full-Duplex Massive MIMO AF Relaying With Direct Link","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769216/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16587977","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7769216/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973) Program","grantNumber":"2013CB329204"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61501110, 61471114, 61461136003, 61571118, 61521061, 61223001 and 61601115"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK20150635"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100008081","fundingName":"Research Fund of National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2016A02 and 2015B02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Transceiver Optimization for Full-Duplex Massive MIMO AF Relaying With Direct Link","sourcePdf":"access-shen-2635677-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087056S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7769216","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7769217,"authors":[{"name":"Uri Rogers","affiliation":["School of Computing and Engineering Sciences, Eastern Washington University, Cheney, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7728/7818038/7769217/roger-2635685-small.gif","p":["Uri Rogers (M\u201910) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA.

The term distributed, indicates that the system information relative to the BAs presence is dispersed across the collection of nanomachines, where each nanomachine possesses limited communication, computation, and movement capabilities. Using Brownian motion with drift, a probabilistic detection and optimal data fusion framework, coined molecular distributed detection, will be introduced that combines theory from both molecular communication and distributed detection. Using the optimal data fusion framework as a guide, simulation indicates that a sub-optimal fusion method exists, allowing for a significant reduction in implementation complexity while retaining BA detection accuracy.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNB.2016.2635685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7818038","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on NanoBioscience","pdfPath":"/iel7/7728/7818038/07769217.pdf","endPage":"880","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel Molecular Distributed Detection With Brownian Motion","doi":"10.1109/TNB.2016.2635685","startPage":"871","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Parallel Molecular Distributed Detection With Brownian Motion","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769217/","dateOfInsertion":"16 January 2017","accessionNumber":"16597924","pubMedId":"28092501","publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7769217/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"8","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel Molecular Distributed Detection With Brownian Motion","sourcePdf":"tnb-rogers-2635685-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.213591S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"7818038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7818038","articleId":"7769217","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7769220,"authors":[{"name":"Hongjia Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongjia","lastName":"Li","orcid":"0000-0003-1683-343X","id":"37600697700"},{"name":"Chang Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chang","lastName":"Yang","orcid":"0000-0001-5034-7676","id":"37085855899"},{"name":"Xueqing Huang","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Xueqing","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085361552"},{"name":"Nirwan Ansari","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Nirwan","lastName":"Ansari","orcid":"0000-0001-8541-3565","id":"37279350900"},{"name":"Zejue Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zejue","lastName":"Wang","orcid":"0000-0002-8192-7179","id":"38666438400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7769220","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":580},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769220","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games","Cooperative caching","Mobile communication","Optimization","Partitioning algorithms","Convergence","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","game theory","Long Term Evolution","radio access networks","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative RAN caching","local altruistic game","cooperative caching placement framework","coordinated multipoint joint transmission","single cell transmission","content transmission time","mobile users","spatial adaptive play algorithms","Nash equilibria","LTE traffic data set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["5G","cooperative RAN caching","NP-hard optimization","local altruistic game"]}],"abstract":"This letter proposes a cooperative caching placement framework for coordinated multi-point joint transmission and single cell transmission, to minimize content transmission time for mobile users.

In our procedure, we first embed a graph into an appropriate Euclidean space to obtain a low-dimensional representation, and then cluster the vertices into communities. We next employ nonparametric graph inference techniques to identify structural similarity among these communities. These two steps are then applied recursively on the communities, allowing us to detect more fine-grained structure. We describe a hierarchical stochastic blockmodel-namely, a stochastic blockmodel with a natural hierarchical structure-and establish conditions under which our algorithm yields consistent estimates of model parameters and motifs, which we define to be stochastically similar groups of subgraphs. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in both simulated and real data.

Both the simulated and the measured results are well matched with the theoretical value.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7855842/07769230.pdf","startPage":"1357","endPage":"1360","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2016.2635694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2016.2635694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7855842","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Efficiency and High-Polarization Separation Reflectarray Element for OAM-Folded Antenna Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reflector antennas","Antenna measurements","Antenna feeds","Antenna arrays","Couplings","Horn antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","microwave antenna arrays","millimetre wave antenna arrays","reflectarray antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-efficiency separation reflectarray element","high-polarization separation reflectarray element","OAM-folded antenna application","single-layer reflectarray element","Ka-band-folded reflectarray","orbital angular momentum","OAM wave generation","performance evaluation","frequency 26.5 GHz to 40 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Folded reflectarray","high-efficiency reflectarray element","high-polarization separation reflectarray element","orbital angular momentum (OAM) reflectarray antenna"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"High-Efficiency and High-Polarization Separation Reflectarray Element for OAM-Folded Antenna Application","volume":"16","htmlLink":"/document/7769230/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2017","accessionNumber":"16891466","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61622105 and 61631012"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"ZYGX2014Z008"},{"fundingName":"Science Foundation for Distinguished Young Scholars of Sichuan Province","grantNumber":"2015JQO005"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Efficiency and High-Polarization Separation Reflectarray Element for OAM-Folded Antenna Application","sourcePdf":"lawp-cheng-2635694-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073022S","chronDate":"2017","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7855842","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7855842","articleId":"7769230","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7769235,"authors":[{"name":"Nadhir Ben Rached","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical and Mathematical Science and Engineering Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7849239/7769235/benra-2635652-small.gif","p":["Nadhir Ben Rached was born in Nabeul, Tunisia.

Our method is based on the derivation of a power series expansion of OP of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. It does not necessitate stringent requirements, the only major ones being the existence of a power series expansion of the cumulative distribution function of the desired user power and the knowledge of the cross moments of the interferers' powers. The newly derived formula is shown to be applicable for most of the well-practical fading models of the desired user under some assumptions on the parameters of the powers' distributions. A further advantage of our method is that it is applicable irrespective of the nature of the fading models of the interfering powers, the only requirement being the perfect knowledge of their cross moments. In order to illustrate the wide scope of applicability of our technique, we present a convergence study of the provided formula for the Generalized Gamma and the Rice fading models. Moreover, we show that our analysis has direct bearing on recent multi-channel applications using selection diversity techniques. Finally, we assess by simulations the accuracy of the proposed formula for various fading environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7849239/07769235.pdf","startPage":"1012","endPage":"1023","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2635652","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2635652","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7849239","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Unified Moment-Based Approach for the Evaluation of the Outage Probability With Noise and Interference","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading channels","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Convergence","Interchannel interference","Closed-form solutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","fading channels","probability","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified moment-based approach","outage probability","power series expansion","signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","cumulative distribution function","Rice fading model","generalized Gamma fading model","selection diversity techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Moment-based approach","outage probability","generalized fading environment","interference","power series expansion","cross-moments","convergence study","selection diversity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769235/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Unified Moment-Based Approach for the Evaluation of the Outage Probability With Noise and Interference","volume":"16","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7769235/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16668605","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100008982","fundingName":"Qatar National Research Fund (a member of The Qatar Foundation) through the National Priorities Research Program","grantNumber":"6-001-2-001"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Unified Moment-Based Approach for the Evaluation of the Outage Probability With Noise and Interference","sourcePdf":"twc-benrached-2635652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122327S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7849239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7849239","articleId":"7769235","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7769237,"authors":[{"name":"Ruikai Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ruikai","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085748389"},{"name":"Yali Zheng","affiliation":["Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Yali","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37900452200"},{"name":"Tony Wing Chung Mak","affiliation":["Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Tony Wing Chung","lastName":"Mak","id":"37086121391"},{"name":"Ruoxi Yu","affiliation":["Department of Surgery, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Ruoxi","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085742643"},{"name":"Sunny H.

Although polypectomy at early stage reduces CRC incidence, 90% of the polyps are small and diminutive, where removal of them poses risks to patients that may outweigh the benefits. Correctly detecting and predicting polyp type during colonoscopy allows endoscopists to resect and discard the tissue without submitting it for histology, saving time, and costs. Nevertheless, human visual observation of early stage polyps varies. Therefore, this paper aims at developing a fully automatic algorithm to detect and classify hyperplastic and adenomatous colorectal polyps. Adenomatous polyps should be removed, whereas distal diminutive hyperplastic polyps are considered clinically insignificant and may be left in situ . A novel transfer learning application is proposed utilizing features learned from big nonmedical datasets with 1.4-2.5 million images using deep convolutional neural network. The endoscopic images we collected for experiment were taken under random lighting conditions, zooming and optical magnification, including 1104 endoscopic nonpolyp images taken under both white-light and narrowband imaging (NBI) endoscopy and 826 NBI endoscopic polyp images, of which 263 images were hyperplasia and 563 were adenoma as confirmed by histology. The proposed method identified polyp images from nonpolyp images in the beginning followed by predicting the polyp histology. When compared with visual inspection by endoscopists, the results of this study show that the proposed method has similar precision (87.3% versus 86.4%) but a higher recall rate (87.6% versus 77.0%) and a higher accuracy (85.9% versus 74.3%). In conclusion, automatic algorithms can assist endoscopists in identifying polyps that are adenomatous but have been incorrectly judged as hyperplasia and, therefore, enable timely resection of these polyps at an early stage before they develop into invasive cancer.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769237/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2017","accessionNumber":"16638870","pubMedId":"28114040","htmlLink":"/document/7769237/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"21","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Automatic Detection and Classification of Colorectal Polyps by Transferring Low-Level CNN Features From Nonmedical Domain","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Hong Kong Innovation and Technology Fund, Shaw Endoscopy Center"},{"fundingName":"Chow Yuk Ho Technology Centre for Innovative Medicine"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Detection and Classification of Colorectal Polyps by Transferring Low-Level CNN Features From Nonmedical Domain","sourcePdf":"jbhi-poon-2635662-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070682S","chronDate":"Jan.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7839252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"147","xplore-issue":"7839252","articleId":"7769237","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7769239,"authors":[{"name":"Shuichi Ohno","affiliation":["Hiroshima University, Higashi-Hiroshima, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7887772/7769239/ohno-2627031-small.gif","p":["Shuichi Ohno (M\u201995\u2013S\u201911) received the B.E., M.E., and Dr.Eng. degrees in applied mathematics and physics from Kyoto University, Japan, in 1990, 1992, and 1995, respectively.

It is shown that a wireless communications system can achieve 51% improvement in the mean signal-to-interference ratio due to the spatial adaptation capability.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2635633","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2635633","startPage":"680","endPage":"683","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7874222/07769240.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874222","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Wireless Channel Control Using Spatially Adaptive Antenna Arrays","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4234/7874222/7769240-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-Wave Wireless Channel Control Using Spatially Adaptive Antenna Arrays","volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16723239","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7769240/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1609581"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Millimeter-Wave Wireless Channel Control Using Spatially Adaptive Antenna Arrays","sourcePdf":"lcomm-yilmaz-2635633-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045565S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7874222","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7874222","articleId":"7769240","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7769247,"authors":[{"name":"Tianqi Mao","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tianqi","lastName":"Mao","id":"37085744051"},{"name":"Qi Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085360215"},{"name":"Zhaocheng Wang","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhaocheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37404925700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7769247","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":75,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1105},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769247","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Indexes","Modulation","Detectors","Fading channels","Niobium","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demodulation","error statistics","fading channels","maximum likelihood detection","multipath channels","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-mode index modulation aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","generalized DM-OFDM","GDM-OFDM bit error rate performance degradation","subcarrier modulation","constellation mode","maximum-likelihood detector","reduced-complexity log-likelihood ratio detector","low signal-to-noise ratio","interleaving technique","demodulation","spectral efficiency enhancement","multipath fading channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","index modulation","maximum likelihood detection","log-likelihood ratio based detection","interleaving technique"]}],"abstract":"Dual-mode index modulation aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (DM-OFDM) is recently proposed, where subcarriers are partitioned into OFDM subblocks, divided into two groups within each subblock, and modulated by two differentiable constellation alphabets. In DM-OFDM, additional bits can be transmitted through indices of subcarriers modulated by the same constellation alphabet. In this letter, generalized DM-OFDM (GDM-OFDM) is proposed, where the number of subcarriers modulated by the same constellation mode in each subblock is alterable. By applying such enhancements, the spectral efficiency can be improved at the cost of marginal performance loss. Moreover, since the bit error rate performance of GDM-OFDM degrades at low signal-to-noise ratios, an interleaving technique is employed to address this issue. At the receiver, a maximum-likelihood detector and a reduced-complexity log-likelihood ratio detector are employed for demodulation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GDM-OFDM is capable of enhancing the spectral efficiency compared with DM-OFDM at the cost of negligible performance loss, and the interleaved GDM-OFDM can harvest on performance gain over GDM-OFDM.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2635634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7894297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2016.2635634","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7894297/07769247.pdf","startPage":"761","endPage":"764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generalized Dual-Mode Index Modulation Aided OFDM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Generalized Dual-Mode Index Modulation Aided OFDM","volume":"21","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2017","dateOfInsertion":"12 April 2017","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7769247/","publicationDate":"April 2017","accessionNumber":"16807361","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769247/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2013CB329200"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Subject Arrangements","grantNumber":"JCYJ20160331184124954"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Peacock Plan","grantNumber":"1108170036003286"},{"fundingName":"Shenzhen Fundamental Research Project","grantNumber":"JCYJ20150401112337177"},{"fundingName":"EPSRC funded projects","grantNumber":"EP/N004558/1 and EP/N023862/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generalized Dual-Mode Index Modulation Aided OFDM","sourcePdf":"lcomm-mao-2635634-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082908S","chronDate":"April  2017","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7894297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7894297","articleId":"7769247","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7769248,"authors":[{"name":"Yaping Du","affiliation":["Department of Building Services Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Author's photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Yaping","lastName":"Du","orcid":"0000-0003-0649-4649","id":"37085723798"},{"name":"Binghao Li","affiliation":["Department of Building Services Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Author's photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Binghao","lastName":"Li","id":"37085534418"},{"name":"Mingli Chen","affiliation":["Department of Building Services Engineering, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Author's photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Mingli","lastName":"Chen","id":"37086035695"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"7769248","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":397},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductors","Wires","Mathematical model","Finite difference methods","Time-domain analysis","Integrated circuit modeling","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coaxial cables","conductors (electric)","finite difference time-domain analysis","lightning protection","skin effect","surges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extended thin-wire model","FDTD","lightning surge","time-domain cascade circuits","finite-difference time-domain thin-wire model","coaxial structure","lossy radio-frequency coaxial cable","lossy round wire structures","wave propagation","finite-difference time-domain model","solid round conductors","cylindrical tubes","coaxial conductors","memory space","computation time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Lightning surge","finite-difference time-domain (FDTD)","extended thin wire model","lossy cable"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an extended thin-wire model for simulating lightning surge or wave propagation on lossy round wire structures.

Thereinto, the technique of ultra-dense networks (UDNs) serves as a key enabler in meeting the roaring mobile traffic demands. With the prevalence of mobile Internet services especially those involve the mobile payment, security has gained an unprecedented amount of attention and become a highlighted feature for the fifth generation. Resource allocation, one of the most significant tools on getting over the obstacle of ubiquitous interference as well as elevating the spectrum/energy efficiency, has attracted substantial efforts, whereas not much of them consider the information security. In a word, security-oriented resource allocation is a non-ignorable field in UDNs resource management, which still needs further study. This paper takes the safety performance as the pivotal issue and refers to the core idea of physical layer security, trying to pave a way for the security design under the framework of the densified networks. In particular, a review of the classical techniques in physical layer security is given from the perspective of resource allocation, which may enlighten the security-based resource management in UDNs. Besides, the challenges as well as potential problems are identified on the basis of the characteristics of UDNs, which can be favorable for targeting the future efforts. In a case study, it is shown that effective blockage of the eavesdropper in UDNs is achievable with the aid of physical layer security, and that the spectrum efficiency is also improved through the careful resource allocation.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2635698","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7419931/07769251.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2635698","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","startPage":"9082","endPage":"9092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Safeguarding the Ultra-dense Networks with the aid of Physical Layer Security: A review and a case study","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769251","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Safeguarding the Ultra-dense Networks with the aid of Physical Layer Security: A review and a case study","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769251/","volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7769251/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"16606842","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61372113 and 61421061"},{"fundingName":"863 Project","grantNumber":"2014AA01A701"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Safeguarding the Ultra-dense Networks with the aid of Physical Layer Security: A review and a case study","sourcePdf":"access-wang-2635698-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100586S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7419931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7419931","articleId":"7769251","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":7769255,"authors":[{"name":"Jing Qian","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7874223/7769255/qian-2635654-small.gif","p":["Jing Qian received the B.Eng. degree in communication engineering from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 2013.

In this paper, we formulate a practical transmission model for an ambient backscatter system, where a tag wishes to send some low-rate messages to a reader with the help of an ambient RF signal source, and then provide fundamental studies of noncoherent symbol detection when all channel state information of the system is unknown. For the first time, a maximum likelihood detector is derived based on the joint probability density function of received signal vectors. In order to ease availability of prior knowledge of the ambient RF signal and reduce computational complexity of the algorithm, we design a joint-energy detector and derive its corresponding detection threshold. The analytical bit error rate (BER) and BER-based outage probability are also obtained in a closed form, which helps with designing system parameters. An estimation method to obtain detection-required parameters and comparison of computational complexity of the detectors are presented as complementary discussions. Simulation results are provided to corroborate theoretical studies.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2016.2635654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2016.2635654","startPage":"1412","endPage":"1422","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7874223/07769255.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7874223","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noncoherent Detections for Ambient Backscatter System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769255/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Noncoherent Detections for Ambient Backscatter System","volume":"16","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 March 2017","accessionNumber":"16725078","publicationDate":"March 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7769255/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422109 and 61571037"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China for Distinguished Young Scholars of China","grantNumber":"61625106"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61531011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noncoherent Detections for Ambient Backscatter System","sourcePdf":"twc-gao-2635654-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.170558S","chronDate":"March  2017","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7874223","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"148","xplore-issue":"7874223","articleId":"7769255","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7769257,"authors":[{"name":"Yuxiang Zhang","affiliation":["Institute of Geophysics and Geomatics, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7801970/7769257/yzhan-2616649-small.gif","p":["Yuxiang Zhang (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in sciences and techniques of remote sensing from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2011.

Many target detection methods uniformly utilize all the spectral information or employ reduced spectral information to distinguish the targets and background. Simultaneously reducing spectral redundancy and preserving the discriminative information is a challenging problem in hyperspectral target detection. The multitask learning (MTL) technique may have the potential to solve the above problem, since it can explore the redundancy knowledge to construct multiple sub-HSIs and integrate them without any information loss. This paper proposes the joint sparse representation and MTL (JSR-MTL) method for hyperspectral target detection. This approach: 1) explores the HSIs similarity by a band cross-grouping strategy to construct multiple sub-HSIs; 2) takes full advantage of the MTL technique to integrate the sparse representation models for the multiple related sub-HSIs; and 3) applies the total reconstruction error difference accumulated over all the tasks to detect the targets. Extensive experiments were carried out on three HSIs, and it was founded that JSR-MTL generally shows a better detection performance than the other target detection methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7801970/07769257.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2016.2616649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2016.2616649","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7801970","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7769257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Sparse Representation and Multitask Learning for Hyperspectral Target Detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Object detection","Training","Hyperspectral imaging","Detectors","Redundancy","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","object detection","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint sparse representation","multitask learning","hyperspectral target detection","hyperspectral images","HSI processing","target detection methods","spectral information","discriminative information","MTL technique","band cross-grouping strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imagery","multitask learning (MTL)","sparse representation","target detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769257/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2017","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"05 December 2016","displayDocTitle":"Joint Sparse Representation and Multitask Learning for Hyperspectral Target Detection","volume":"55","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7769257/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2017","accessionNumber":"16581186","dateOfInsertion":"29 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61471274 and 41431175"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003819","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Hubei Province","grantNumber":"2014CFB193"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"2042014kf0239"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Sparse Representation and Multitask Learning for Hyperspectral Target Detection","sourcePdf":"tgrs-du-2616649-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110538S","chronDate":"Feb.  2017","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7801970","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7801970","articleId":"7769257","onlineDate":"05 December 2016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7769361,"authors":[{"name":"Gary A.

While straightforward application of the standard FDTD algorithm at very low frequencies leads to excessively long simulation times, we show that for linear structures this problem can be circumvented by using a ramp excitation function. The use of appropriate absorbing boundary conditions such as Berenger's perfectly matched layer is also shown to be necessary. By combining two plane waves in opposite directions, a uniform electric or magnetic field can be created so that the electric and magnetic field solutions are decoupled, as required in quasi-static analysis.

The midpoint of this path was located at a corrected geomagnetic latitude of 12\u00b0. The objective of these measurements was to supplement the existing data base describing propagation conditions on the HF transauroral channel with data pertaining to a period around the time of solar maximum. Received signals for this path fell into three distinct groups depending on their amplitude and delay and Doppler spread characteristics. These are (1) strong, specularly reflected ionospheric returns characteristic of a quiescent daytime ionospheric channel during magnetically quiet conditions; (2) strong specular multipath signals reflected from horizontal gradients of electron density and regularly encountered at night; and (3) weak scatter returns that are also a persistent nighttime phenomenon. The scatter returns are usually observed at delays exceeding those anticipated for the one-hop return and, very often, at frequencies that are well above the MUF for the great circle propagation path. The multipath and scatter returns exhibit large delay and Doppler spreads indicative of spatially extensive distributions of drifting and randomly moving irregularities. Two measurement events are discussed which illustrate these conclusions: a noontime measurement with Kp = 3, and a midnight measurement with Kp = 2. The noontime measurement exhibited a scatter return from an isolated irregularity region in addition to the usual ionospheric reflected signals. A simple irregularity drift model produced delay and Doppler shift curves that were consistent with those observed for the scatter component of the received signal and supported a hypothesis of an irregularity region drift speed of 1200 m s\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u22121</sup>\n parallel to the great circle propagation path.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7769742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1029/94RS03177","publicationTitle":"Radio Science","displayPublicationTitle":"Radio Science","pdfPath":"/iel7/7742793/7769742/07769752.pdf","startPage":"659","endPage":"676","doi":"10.1029/94RS03177","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay, Doppler, and amplitude characteristics of HF signals received over a 1300-km transauroral sky wave channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  1995","displayDocTitle":"Delay, Doppler, and amplitude characteristics of HF signals received over a 1300-km transauroral sky wave channel","volume":"30","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 1995","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769752/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May-June  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay, Doppler, and amplitude characteristics of HF signals received over a 1300-km transauroral sky wave channel","sourcePdf":"rds3647.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027477S","chronDate":"May-June  1995","isNumber":"7769742","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7769752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7769822,"authors":[{"name":"Ammad Akram","affiliation":["Radio Science and Propagation Group, Defence Research Agency, Malvern, England"],"firstName":"Ammad","lastName":"Akram"},{"name":"Paul S.

The signal availability improvement factor of the Butler matrix is found to range between 1.6\u20131.8 over the snr threshold range of 20\u201330 dB in a 300-Hz bandwidth. Experimental values of the Butler matrix signal availability improvement factor are compared with analytical predictions. The experimental values show an expected snr threshold dependency with a dramatic increase at high snr. A theoretical analysis is developed to describe this increase. The signal availability can be further improved by \u223c10\u201320% in a system employing two four-element Butler matrices with squinted beams so as to illuminate the sky with eight high-gain beams. Space diversity is found to increase the signal availability of a single antenna system by \u223c10\u201315%, but the technique has very little advantage in a system already employing passive beam formation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"AGU","chronOrPublicationDate":"March-April  1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7769822/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March-April  1996","volume":"31","issue":"02","publicationDate":"March-April 1996","dateOfInsertion":"12 December 2016","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Passive beam forming and spatial diversity in meteor scatter communication systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Passive beam forming and spatial diversity in meteor scatter communication systems","sourcePdf":"rds3776.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039171S","chronDate":"March-April  1996","isNumber":"7769814","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742793","articleId":"7769822","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"AGU Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-10-12"},{"_id":7769846,"authors":[{"name":"Richard W.

Contrary to the conventional approach where the ISAR image is obtained by inverse Fourier transforming the computed scattered field data over frequency and aspect, this image domain formula gives the contribution of each ray to the overall ISAR image directly. Under the small angle approximation and utilizing the bistatic-monostatic equivalence, the image domain ray tube integration formula is determined in closed form.
