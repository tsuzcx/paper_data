Detection of low concentration of biological agents is possible using accurate and real-time signal characterization devices. This paper presents a multi-channel conductometric array that can detect and measure current up to femtoampere range. The architecture uses a novel semi-synchronous \u03a3\u0394 modulation that allows measurement of ultra-small currents by using a hysteretic comparison technique. The architecture achieves higher energy efficiency over a conventional \u03a3\u0394 by reducing the total switching cycles of the comparator. A 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm chip implementing a 42 channel potentiostat array has been prototyped in a 0.5\u03bcm CMOS technology. Measured results show 10 bits of resolution, with a sensitivity of upto 50 fA of current. The power consumption of the potentiostat is 11\u03bcW per channel at a sampling rate of 250 kHz. The multi-channel potentiostat has been integrated with a conductometric biosensor for field deployable applications. Results with a Bacillus Cereus based biosensor demonstrate the effectiveness of the potentiostat in characterizing different concentration levels of pathogens in realtime.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A multi-channel femtoampere-sensitivity conductometric array for biosensing applications","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260865","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4028925/4030573/04030579.pdf","startPage":"6489","endPage":"6492","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04030579.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4030573","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4030579","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4030579/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","displayDocTitle":"A multi-channel femtoampere-sensitivity conductometric array for biosensing applications","conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"Supplement","htmlLink":"/document/4030579/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","publicationDate":"2006","pubMedId":"17959433","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A multi-channel femtoampere-sensitivity conductometric array for biosensing applications","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"2142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058572S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4028925","isNumber":"4030573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4028925","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4030573","articleId":"4030579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4030594,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Single channel recordings of brain signals are preprocessed through the method of delays, and the delay matrix processed with the BSS technique described here called LSDIAGTD which uses temporal decorrelation to implement the now popular Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm. This allows the identification and extraction of statistically independent sources underlying these single channel recordings. In particular we depict the analysis of single channel recordings from a Brain-Computer Interfacing paradigm. We show that BSS technique applied in this way extracts a series of codebook vectors representing the spectral content underlying the recorded signal. It then becomes possible to identify and extract particular rhythmic activity underlying the recordings. We show that rhythmic activity in the 8 to 12Hz band can be extracted in the case of imagined hand movements for a particular BCI paradigm.","doi":"10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260887","publicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society","pdfPath":"/iel5/4028925/4030573/04030594.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMBS.2006.260887","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4030573","startPage":"6544","endPage":"6547","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/04030594.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Source Separation in single-channel EEG analysis: An application to BCI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4030594","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind Source Separation in single-channel EEG analysis: An application to BCI","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4030594/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"30 Aug.-3 Sept. 2006","isConference":true,"volume":"Supplement","publicationDate":"2006","pubMedId":"17959448","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4030594/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Source Separation in single-channel EEG analysis: An application to BCI","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"2157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067324S","chronDate":"Aug. 30 2006-Sept. 3 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4028925","isNumber":"4030573","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4028925","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4030573","articleId":"4030594","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4030608,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Sayadi","affiliation":["Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Sayadi","id":"37658952700"},{"name":"Mohammad Bagher Shamsollahi","affiliation":["Biomedical Engineering Department of Sharif, University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Mohammad Bagher","lastName":"Shamsollahi","id":"37285089000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0032-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1557-170X"}],"articleNumber":"4030608","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":270},"abstract":"In this paper a new ECG denoising scheme is proposed using a novel adaptive wavelet transform, named bionic wavelet transform (BWT), which had been first developed based on a model of the active auditory system.

This is achieved by integrating timing information, e.g. from standard delay format (SDF) files, into the ATPG tool. The timing information is used to guide the test generator to detect faults through the longest paths in order to improve the ability to detect small delay detects. To avoid propagating faults through similar paths repeatedly, a weighted random method is proposed to improve the path coverage during test generation. During fault simulation, a new fault-dropping criterion, named dropping based on slack margin (DSM), is proposed to facilitate the trade-off between the test set quality and the test pattern count. The quality of the generated test set is measured by two metrics: delay test coverage and SDQL. The experimental results show that significant test quality improvement is achieved when applying timing-aware ATPG with DSM to industrial designs","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing-Aware ATPG for High Quality At-speed Testing of Small Delay Defects","publicationTitle":"2006 15th Asian Test Symposium","doi":"10.1109/ATS.2006.261012","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 15th Asian Test Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel5/4030717/4030718/04030760.pdf","startPage":"139","endPage":"146","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ATS.2006.261012","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4030718","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4030760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4030760/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Timing-Aware ATPG for High Quality At-speed Testing of Small Delay Defects","conferenceDate":"20-23 Nov. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4030760/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","accessionNumber":"9308625","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing-Aware ATPG for High Quality At-speed Testing of Small Delay Defects","confLoc":"Fukuoka, Japan","sourcePdf":"26280139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084765S","chronDate":"Nov.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4030717","isNumber":"4030718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4030717","citationCount":"103","xplore-issue":"4030718","articleId":"4030760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4030781,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaogang Du","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaogang","lastName":"Du","id":"37834903800"},{"name":"Nilanjan Mukherjee","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Nilanjan","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37326892000"},{"name":"Chris Hill","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Chris","lastName":"Hill","id":"37834108700"},{"name":"Wu-tung Cheng","affiliation":["Mentor Graphics Corporation, Wilsonville, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Wu-tung","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37280064100"},{"name":"Sudhakar Reddy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, University of Iowa, IA, USA"],"firstName":"Sudhakar","lastName":"Reddy","id":"37276068300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2628-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1081-7735"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5386"}],"articleNumber":"4030781","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Built-in self-test","Memory architecture","Random access memory","Manufacturing processes","Computer aided manufacturing","Hardware","Silicon","Automatic control","Automatic testing","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["built-in self test","failure analysis","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit yield","integrated memory circuits","logic testing","programmable controllers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable memory","BIST architecture supporting algorithms","multiple nested loops","manufacturing defects","embedded memories","random defects","systematic defects","parametric defects","memory failures","controllers","complex algorithm","failure analysis","memory test algorithm","65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Programmable","Memory BIST","Memory Test Algorithm","Multiple Nested Loops"]}],"abstract":"Field programmable memory BIST controllers are becoming a necessity to target manufacturing defects in embedded memories. For 65nm and below, random defects are not the only ones affecting the yield of a process. Systematic as well as parametric defects are now the predominant causes of memory failures and have to be addressed. Conventional memory BIST algorithms are usually targeted to catch random defects. In order to catch such systematic and parametric defects, it is necessary to have the flexibility to apply new algorithms to embedded memories after manufacturing. In this paper, a field programmable memory BIST architecture is proposed to support multiple loops within a test step of an algorithm, including nested loops.

The proposed approach uses the \"locked-histogram\" technique to gather the statistical data on the aperture uncertainty of the device-under-test. It further correlates the data obtained from the locked-histogram technique to the true SNR of the device-under-test.

Previous CRT-RSA algorithms such as CRT-2 and BOS are susceptible to practical hardware fault attacks. In this paper, a new CRT-RSA algorithm with countermeasures to hardware fault attacks is proposed. To our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first that can resist what we call the single-fault adversarial attacks. The proposed algorithm first computes the signature using CRT in a secret algebraic setting, then a set of fault-detection variables are computed to detect possible faults. Lastly, the signature is mapped from the secret algebraic setting to the intended setting. By using a random number and the fault detection variables, every step of the algorithm is protected from hardware faults. The output of the algorithm will be fully randomized in case of faults. The CRT's speed advantages are also maintained. The proposed algorithm is approximately two times as fast as the direct form RSA for the two-prime case, and about four times as fast for the three-prime case","doi":"10.1109/DASC.2006.5","publicationTitle":"2006 2nd IEEE International Symposium on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 2nd IEEE International Symposium on Dependable, Autonomic and Secure Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4030851/4030852/04030866.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DASC.2006.5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4030852","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CRT-RSA Algorithm Secure against Hardware Fault Attacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4030866/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept. 29 2006-Oct. 1 2006","displayDocTitle":"A CRT-RSA Algorithm Secure against Hardware Fault Attacks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2006","accessionNumber":"9275309","htmlLink":"/document/4030866/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CRT-RSA Algorithm Secure against Hardware Fault Attacks","confLoc":"Indianapolis, IN, USA","sourcePdf":"25390051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079344S","chronDate":"Sept. 29 2006-Oct. 1 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4030851","isNumber":"4030852","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4030851","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4030852","articleId":"4030866","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4030938,"authors":[{"name":"Ilia Polian","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma City Nara, Japan","Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"firstName":"Ilia","lastName":"Polian","id":"37273423400"},{"name":"Bernd Becker","affiliation":["Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany"],"firstName":"Bernd","lastName":"Becker","id":"37273427200"},{"name":"Masato Nakasato","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma City Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Masato","lastName":"Nakasato","id":"37831497300"},{"name":"Satoshi Ohtake","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma City Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Satoshi","lastName":"Ohtake","id":"37273569100"},{"name":"Hideo Fujiwara","affiliation":["Graduate School of Information Science, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Ikoma City Nara, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideo","lastName":"Fujiwara","id":"37087791708"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2706-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-5774"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-7966"}],"articleNumber":"4030938","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image processing","Costs","Radiation hardening","Redundancy","Circuits","Silicon","Frequency estimation","Consumer electronics","Switches","Computer errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","motion estimation","radiation hardening (electronics)","safety-critical software","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost hardening","image processing","safety-critical applications","radiation hardening","soft errors","image perturbations","motion estimation subsystem","MPEG-2","automatic determination"]}],"abstract":"Image processing systems are increasingly used in safety-critical applications, and their hardening against soft errors becomes an issue. The authors propose a methodology to identify soft errors as uncritical based on their impact on the system's functionality. The authors call a soft error uncritical if its impact is provably limited to image perturbations during a very short period of time (number of cycles) and the system is guaranteed to recover thereafter. Uncritical errors do not require hardening as their effects are unperceivable for the human user of the system. The authors focus on soft errors in the motion estimation subsystem of MPEG-2 and introduce different definitions of uncritical soft errors in that subsystem.

When hardware hardening is not cost-effective, software implemented hardware fault tolerance (SIHFT) can be a solution to increase SoCs' dependability. However, SIHFT increases the time for running the hardened application, and the memory occupation. In this paper we propose a method that eliminates the memory overhead, using a new approach to instruction hardening and control flow checking during the execution of the application, without the need for introducing any change in its source code. The proposed method is also non-intrusive, since it does not require any modification in the main processor's architecture.

However, major drawback of this method is poor utilization of processing elements (PEs) in the reconfiguration process. In this paper, the previous method (Fukushi et al., 2005) for efficient reconfiguration was improved. The key idea is to treat the reconfiguration problem as an optimization problem of determining routing directions for all faulty PEs.

This paper presents an algorithm to help quantify the problem by identifying defects and potentially tracking defect growth. Building on previous research, this technique is extended to utilize a more realistic defect model suitable for analyzing real-world camera systems. Monte Carlo simulations show that abnormal sensitivity defects are successfully detected by analyzing only 40 typical photographs. Experimentation also indicates that this technique can be applied to imagers with up to 4% defect density, and that noisy images can be diagnosed successfully with only a small reduction in accuracy.

The approach is that once the optimization process is interactively defined through a GUI, the process runs asynchronously, automatically, and autonomously. This goal is being achieved through horizontal integration by employing a Service Oriented Architecture. The developed cyberinfrastructure comprises a collection of Grid services that automates creation, submission and monitoring of jobs. In addition, support is provided for accessing information needed to identify the reasons of failures, should any occur, The front end of the system augments a commercial, state-of-the-art user graphical interface (Abacus CAE) for defining a finite element analysis problem with custom GUI components for specifying the optimization problem and providing access to remote resources. The access to remote resources is achieved by embedding clients of Grid services in the Abacus CAE.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4031019/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4031019/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Grid-Based System for Product Design Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grid-Based System for Product Design Optimization","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"27340046.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048006S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4030972","isNumber":"4030973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4030972","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4030973","articleId":"4031019","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4031042,"authors":[{"name":"Ann Chervenak","affiliation":["Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California, USA"],"firstName":"Ann","lastName":"Chervenak","id":"37276638200"},{"name":"Jennifer M.

In this paper we present the first application of the multiobjective non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to the GENIE-1 Earth System Model (ESM). Twelve model parameters are tuned to improve four objective measures of fitness to observational data. Grid computing and data handling technology is harnessed to perform the concurrent simulations that comprise the generations of the genetic algorithm. Recent advances in the method exploit Response Surface Modelling to provide surrogate models of each objective. This enables more extensive and efficient searching of the design space. We assess the performance of the NSGA-II using surrogates by repeating a tuning exercise that has been performed using a proximal analytical centre plane cutting method and the Ensemble Kalman Filter on the GENIE-1 model. We find that the multiobjective algorithm locates Pareto-optimal solutions which are of comparable quality to those obtained using the single objective optimisation methods.","doi":"10.1109/E-SCIENCE.2006.261050","pdfPath":"/iel5/4030972/4030973/04031090.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"117","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Second IEEE International Conference on e-Science and Grid Computing (e-Science'06)","publicationTitle":"2006 Second IEEE International Conference on e-Science and Grid Computing (e-Science'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/E-SCIENCE.2006.261050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4030973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Tuning of Grid-Enabled Earth System Models Using a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4031090/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Tuning of Grid-Enabled Earth System Models Using a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II)","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4031090/","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Tuning of Grid-Enabled Earth System Models Using a Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II)","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"27340117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071005S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4030972","isNumber":"4030973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4030972","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4030973","articleId":"4031090","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4031197,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Yu","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaofeng","lastName":"Yu","id":"38469029300"},{"name":"Jun Hu","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37087903693"},{"name":"Yan Zhang","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087902147"},{"name":"Tian Zhang","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38468615200"},{"name":"Linzhang Wang","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Linzhang","lastName":"Wang","id":"37406759900"},{"name":"Jianhua Zhao","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Jianhua","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37405216000"},{"name":"Xuandong Li","affiliation":["Nanjing University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Xuandong","lastName":"Li","id":"37406902100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2558-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-7719"}],"articleNumber":"4031197","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":127},"abstract":"The growing scale and complexity of the enterprise computing systems under distributed and heterogeneous environments present new challenges to system development, integration, and maintenance. In this paper, we present a model driven Web service development framework to combat these challenges. The framework capitalizes on the UML profile for Enterprise Distributed Object Computing (EDOC), MDA and Web services. Within the framework, first, the platform independent models (PIMs) are created using the EDOC profile. Second, the PIMs are broken down into sub PIMs according to functional decomposition, each of which can provide service independently and will be implemented in a Web service. Then, these sub PIMs are transformed into the corresponding Web service interface models for service publication and invoking. Finally, supported by model transform techniques, the sub PIMs are implemented into Web services on specific platforms. Automatic model transformation is the key to this framework, therefore, the transformation from EDOC models to Web service interface models within this framework is deeply discussed, and the detailed transformation rules are proposed. A case study is also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of these rules and the merits of this framework","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Distributed computing","Unified modeling language","XML","Computer architecture","Standards publication","Simple object access protocol","Software maintenance","Computer science","Software systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","distributed object management","Unified Modeling Language","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven development framework","enterprise Web services","enterprise computing systems","distributed environment","heterogeneous environment","UML profile","Enterprise Distributed Object Computing","platform independent models","functional decomposition","automatic model transformation","Web service interface model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MDA","EDOC","Web Services"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EDOC.2006.9","publicationTitle":"2006 10th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference (EDOC'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 10th IEEE International Enterprise Distributed Object Computing Conference (EDOC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4031176/4031177/04031197.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4031177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDOC.2006.9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Model Driven Development Framework for Enterprise Web Services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4031197","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Model Driven Development Framework for Enterprise Web Services","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4031197/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4031197/","accessionNumber":"9297350","conferenceDate":"16-20 Oct. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 Oct. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Model Driven Development Framework for Enterprise Web Services","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"25580075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.143335S","chronDate":"16-20 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4031176","isNumber":"4031177","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4031176","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4031177","articleId":"4031197","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4031221,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth Chan","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Chan","id":"37831469300"},{"name":"Iman Poernomo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Poernomo","id":"37266993000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2558-X","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1541-7719"}],"articleNumber":"4031221","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Unified modeling language","Computer integrated manufacturing","Quality of service","Computer architecture","Runtime","Monitoring","Instruments","Software design","Software measurement","Software standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","quality of service","software architecture","Unified Modeling Language"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QoS-aware model driven architecture","quality of service","constraint specification","runtime monitoring","UML2 superstructure","UML profile","component-and-connector systems","common information model",".NET-based metamodel","Windows Management Instrumentation interface"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4031221","abstract":"The specification of quality of service (QoS) constraints over software design requires measures that ensure such requirements are met by the delivered product.

Equivalently, they may be viewed as functions that use a short random seed to map a source on n bits to a source on many fewer bits while preserving all of the min-entropy. It is known how to build lossless condensers when the graphs are slightly unbalanced in the work of M. Capalbo et al. (2002). The highly unbalanced case is also important but the only known construction does not condense the source well. We give explicit constructions of lossless condensers with condensing close to optimal, and using near-optimal seed length.

This problem was addressed before in the works of E. Ben-Sasson et al. (2003) and D. Moshkovitz and R. Raz (2006) but the solutions apply only to degree one curves, i.e., lines. Our technique is new and elegant. We use sub-sampling and obtain our curve samplers by composing a sequence of low-degree manifolds, starting with high-dimension, low-degree manifolds and proceeding through lower and lower dimension manifolds with (moderately) growing degrees, until we finish with dimension-one, low-degree manifolds, i.e., curves.

This paper investigates how much trust is necessary $that is, how many players must remain honest - in order for distributed quantum computations to be possible. We present a verifiable quantum secret sharing (VQSS) protocol, and a general secure multiparty quantum computation (MPQC) protocol, which can tolerate any cheaters among n players. Previous protocols for these tasks tolerated lfloor (n - 1)/4 rfloor and lfloor (n - 1)/6 rfloor cheaters, respectively. The threshold we achieve is tight - even in the classical case, \"fair\" multiparty computation is not possible if any set of n/2 players can cheat. Our protocols rely on approximate quantum error-correcting codes, which can tolerate a larger fraction of errors than traditional, exact codes.

We derive a mixing result for PageRank vectors similar to that for random walks, and show that the ordering of the vertices produced by a PageRank vector reveals a cut with small conductance. In particular, we show that for any set C with conductance Phi and volume k, a PageRank vector with a certain starting distribution can be used to produce a set with conductance (O(radic(Phi log k)).

As a result there is frequently a disconnect between business process models, business definition of data artifacts and the data stored in the data warehouses as they are often designed manually and in isolation. Hence it has always been a challenge to keep the data warehouse in sync with the continuously changing business process models, resulting in both high maintenance costs and lost opportunities. In this paper, we present our model driven data warehousing (MDDW) approach in the area of business performance management (BPM). The purpose of MDDW is to bridge the gap between the business process models and the data warehouse models, thus enable the rapid adaptation to changes in the business environment. We describe our modeling framework comprising the various modeling elements and meta-models that capture both business and IT data artifacts","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4031692/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2006","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"24-26 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4031692/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9297004","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Model Driven Data Warehousing for Business Performance Management","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model Driven Data Warehousing for Business Performance Management","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"26450483.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055902S","chronDate":"Oct.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4031613","isNumber":"4031614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4031613","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4031614","articleId":"4031692","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4031882,"authors":[{"name":"Oleksandr Grygorash","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Sciences, University of South Alabama, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Grygorash","id":"37830770700"},{"name":"Yan Zhou","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Sciences, University of South Alabama, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37273642700"},{"name":"Zach Jorgensen","affiliation":["School of Computer and Information Sciences, University of South Alabama, AL, USA"],"firstName":"Zach","lastName":"Jorgensen","id":"37828459600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2728-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1082-3409"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0197"}],"articleNumber":"4031882","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":80,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1873},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Partitioning algorithms","Tree graphs","Image color analysis","Image edge detection","Mobile computing","Engineering drawings","Image analysis","Spatial resolution","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["edge detection","image colour analysis","pattern clustering","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["minimum spanning tree clustering","k-partition","edge removal","k-means","image color clustering"]}],"abstract":"The minimum spanning tree clustering algorithm is known to be capable of detecting clusters with irregular boundaries.

In this paper, we present a stochastic graph-based algorithm, called OutRank, for detecting outlying objects. In our method, a matrix is constructed using the similarity between objects and used as the adjacency matrix of the graph representation. The heart of this approach is the Markov model that is built upon this graph, which assigns an outlier score to each object. Using this framework, we show that our algorithm is more powerful than the existing outlier detection schemes and can effectively address the inherent problems of such schemes.

This requires efficient search of the feasible design region for optimal solutions which simultaneously satisfy multiple design objectives. The search is further complicated in view of the fact that because of inherent manufacturing variations it is often necessary to allocate tolerances to design variables while guaranteeing low variances for product/process performance measures. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a powerful search technique with faster convergence rates than traditional evolutionary algorithms. This paper introduces a new PSO-based approach to multiobjective engineering design by incorporating the central qualitycontrol notion of tolerance design Unlike classical optimization techniques which rely on single-point representation of designs, the modified PSO algorithm allocates tolerances to design variables and flies a swarm of hypercubic particles through the feasible space. To demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, the multiobjective design of an I-beam will be presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICTAI.2006.20","pdfPath":"/iel5/4031858/4031859/04031971.pdf","startPage":"765","endPage":"772","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 18th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI'06)","publicationTitle":"2006 18th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI'06)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTAI.2006.20","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4031859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Particle Swarm Algorithm for Multiobjective Design Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4031971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Nov. 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Particle Swarm Algorithm for Multiobjective Design Optimization","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9308536","publicationDate":"Nov. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4031971/","conferenceDate":"13-15 Nov. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Particle Swarm Algorithm for Multiobjective Design Optimization","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"27280765.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054215S","chronDate":"13-15 Nov. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4031858","isNumber":"4031859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4031858","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4031859","articleId":"4031971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4032069,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Tan","affiliation":["Department Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Tan","id":"37531861600"},{"name":"Zhong Tian","affiliation":["IBM China Software Development Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Tian","id":"37675222900"},{"name":"Fangyan Rao","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Fangyan","lastName":"Rao","id":"37267293900"},{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Wang","id":"37835972800"},{"name":"Ru Fang","affiliation":["IBM China Research Laboratory, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ru","lastName":"Fang","id":"37700947600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2669-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4032069","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"abstract":"Solution design has been more of an art than an engineering discipline. Lots of researchers and practitioners have proposed and exercised different kinds of approaches with varied success. Most of these methods seem to have focused on building new solutions from scratch. However, enterprise solutions today are mostly built on top of an existing IT infrastructure. The notion of SoA is trying to pave a way to integrate heterogeneous components together to meet new business needs. When a new requirement is given to a system developer in the form of business processes, it would be ideal if she/he can make the best of existing services for many reasons. In this paper we propose a data driven approach to provide service composition guidance to implement the given requirement. Based on the relations among business domain data and service domain data, we can generate additional data mediations according to three composition rules. With these data relations and composition rules, we give a formal approach to devise choreography of services from current service portfolio, plus additional data mediation artifacts to realize a given requirement.

The significant advantages of the single transform module are fall hardware-utilization and low-power. The second architecture features parallel and pipelined computation and high throughput. Both architectures are very suitable for VLSI implementation of new-generation image coding/decoding systems, such as JPEG-2000.

Web applications with complex business require Web container to provide differentiated services for requests from different clients according to role or payment, etc. However, most traditional Web containers still adopt the best-effort service mode. Some approaches such as admission control and priority scheduling have been provided to do with the problem, but they do not solve the problem completely for lack of the considerations in the architecture. This paper brings forward an event-driven adaptive differentiated service Web container architecture named EADWA. In EADWA, requests from clients are encapsulated into request events which connect a group of self-management units (SMU) to compose request process flow that is called SMU chain. EADWA provides both SMU-based and SMU chain-based differentiated services for requests from different clients according to SLA (Service Level Agreement) defined by application developer. In addition, SMU-based differentiated services can select proper differentiated service strategies adaptively. The experiments on prototype show the effect of EADWA","doi":"10.1109/QSIC.2006.12","publicationTitle":"2006 Sixth International Conference on Quality Software (QSIC'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 Sixth International Conference on Quality Software (QSIC'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4032250/4032251/04032265.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/QSIC.2006.12","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 Oct. 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032265/","displayDocTitle":"An Event-Driven Adaptive Differentiated Service Web Container Architecture","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9287711","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4032265/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","conferenceDate":"27-28 Oct. 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Event-Driven Adaptive Differentiated Service Web Container Architecture","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"27180022.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050857S","chronDate":"27-28 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4032250","isNumber":"4032251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4032250","xplore-issue":"4032251","articleId":"4032265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4032312,"authors":[{"name":"Zhifeng Lai","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Zhifeng","lastName":"Lai","id":"37823798400"},{"name":"S.c.

However, the assumption may not always hold in reality. Even the assumption holds, the state machine could be invalidated when the system evolves. This triggers the study of adaptive model checking, which necessitates an iterative construction of a state machine for a system. In this paper, we propose a dynamic learning approach based on genetic algorithm to iteratively generate a finite-state automaton from a given system. In view of the fact that modern systems are apt to change, our algorithm postpones expensive equivalence checking until the associated accuracy is required for the verification of some properties. We explain in details the core learning process of our algorithm, including encoding the model and its synthesis from a given training set.

As researchers are investigating new methods for migrating portions of applications into custom hardware circuits, it is also critical to develop new run-time service frameworks to support these capabilities. Hthreads (HybridThreads) is a multithreaded RTOS kernel for hybrid FPGA/CPU systems designed to meet this new growing need. A key capability of hthreads is the migration of thread management, synchronization primitives, and run-time scheduling services for both hardware and software threads into hardware. This paper describes the hthreads scheduler, a key component for controlling both software-resident threads (SW threads) and threads implemented in programmable logic (HW threads). Run-time analysis shows that the hthreads scheduler module helps in reducing unwanted system overhead and jitter when compared to historical software schedulers, while fielding scheduling requests from both hardware and software threads in parallel with application execution. Run time analysis shows the scheduler achieves constant time scheduling for up to 256 active threads with a total of 128 different priority levels, while using uniform APIs for threads requesting OS services from either side of the hardware/software boundary","doi":"10.1109/RTSS.2006.45","publicationTitle":"2006 27th IEEE International Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 27th IEEE International Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4032320/4032321/04032331.pdf","startPage":"3","endPage":"12","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTSS.2006.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032321","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032331","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Run-Time Services for Hybrid CPU/FPGA Systems on Chip","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032331/","displayDocTitle":"Run-Time Services for Hybrid CPU/FPGA Systems on Chip","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4032331/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9308584","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Run-Time Services for Hybrid CPU/FPGA Systems on Chip","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"27610003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082824S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4032320","isNumber":"4032321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4032320","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4032321","articleId":"4032331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4032358,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-mei Hung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-mei","lastName":"Hung","id":"37289819000"},{"name":"Jian-jia Chen","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jian-jia","lastName":"Chen","id":"37280675200"},{"name":"Tei-wei Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Graduate Institute of Networking and Multimedia, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tei-wei","lastName":"Kuo","id":"37276775300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2761-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1052-8725"}],"articleNumber":"4032358","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":46,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":423},"abstract":"Multiple processing elements are often adopted in the current designs of embedded systems.

We consider task scheduling under different power consumption models of the non-DVS PE. When the power consumption of the non-DVS PE is independent on the assigned workload, a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme is developed for energy-efficient scheduling. When the energy consumption of the non-DVS PE depends on the assigned workload, a 0.5-approximation algorithm is developed to maximize the energy saving, compared to the execution of tasks on a DVS processor.

Our solution uses a generalized power model, in which frequency-dependent and frequency-independent power components are explicitly considered. Further, variations in power dissipations and on-chip/off-chip access patterns of different tasks are encoded in the problem formulation. Using this generalized power model, we show that it is possible to obtain analytically the task-level energy-efficient speed below which DVS starts to affect overall energy consumption negatively. Then, we formulate the system-wide energy management problem as a non-linear optimization problem and provide a polynomial-time solution. We also provide a dynamic slack reclaiming extension which considers the effects of slow-down on the system-wide energy consumption.

Each object in the database models a real world entity. The freshness of these objects is maintained by update transactions that sample the real world entities. The literature proposes various ways to derive a schedule of transactions that preserves the freshness (also known as absolute consistency) of these objects. But these approaches do not take care of the mutual consistency of the objects, i.e., whether together they represent a logical state of the system. We investigate the problem of checking whether, given an update transaction schedule, a periodic query would be able to read mutually consistent values. We propose solutions for both single- and multiple-query cases in the presence of non-preemptable query executions. Specifically, we first investigate formulas that give the maximal value of mutual gaps among a set of data read at a certain point in time. (A mutual gap for two object values read from the database refers to the difference between the times at which the two objects were updated.) We then propose design approaches to (1) decide the period and relative deadline of a query so that it would guarantee mutual consistency; (2) decide if a given set of queries with relative deadlines and periods can guarantee mutual consistency.

Schedulers have been developed for each of these types, but these are essentially point solutions in the space of soft real-time and no detailed unified definition of soft real-time has previously been provided that includes all types of soft realtime processing. We present a complete real-time taxonomy covering the spectrum of processes from best-effort to hard real-time. The taxonomy divides processes into nine classes based on their resource and timeliness requirements and includes four soft real-time classes, each of which captures a group of soft real-time applications with similar characteristics. We exploit the different features of each of the soft real-time classes to integrate all of them into a single scheduler together with hard real-time and best-effort processes and present results demonstrating their performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4032364/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9297572","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Diverse Soft Real-Time Processing in an Integrated System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diverse Soft Real-Time Processing in an Integrated System","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"27610369.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059702S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"4032320","isNumber":"4032321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4032320","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4032321","articleId":"4032364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4032367,"authors":[{"name":"Sharmila Subramaniam","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Sharmila","lastName":"Subramaniam","id":"37826146600"},{"name":"Vana Kalogeraki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of California, Riverside, USA"],"firstName":"Vana","lastName":"Kalogeraki","id":"37283203600"},{"name":"Themis Palpanas","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

Using Network Calculus, we derive \"plug-and-play \" expressions for the end-to-end delay bounds, buffering and bandwidth requirements as a function of the WSN cluster-tree characteristics and traffic specifications. The cluster-tree topology has been adopted by many cluster-based solutions for WSNs. We demonstrate how to apply our general results for dimensioning IEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee cluster-tree WSNs.

In this paper, we apply linear (ARMA, multivariate, random walk) and nonlinear (Radial and Universal Basis Functions) regression techniques to recognize system failures and to predict the system's call availability up to 15 minutes in advance. Secondly we introduce a novel nonlinear modeling technique for call availability prediction. We benchmark all five techniques against each other. The applied modeling methods are data driven rather than analytical and can handle large amounts of data. We apply the modeling techniques to real data of a commercial telecommunication platform. The data used for modeling includes: a) time stamped event-based log files; and b) continuously measured system states. Results are given in terms of a) receiver operator characteristics (AUC) for classification into classes of failure and non-failure states and b) as a cost-benefit analysis. Our findings suggest: a) high degree of nonlinearity in the data; b) statistically significant improved forecasting performance and cost-benefit ratio of nonlinear modeling techniques; and finally finding that c) log file data does not contribute to improve model performance with any modeling technique","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2006.12","publicationTitle":"2006 25th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS'06)","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 25th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4032454/4032455/04032471.pdf","startPage":"83","endPage":"95","doi":"10.1109/SRDS.2006.12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Call Availability Prediction in a Telecommunication System: A Data Driven Empirical Approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Call Availability Prediction in a Telecommunication System: A Data Driven Empirical Approach","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4032471/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9274807","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032471/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call Availability Prediction in a Telecommunication System: A Data Driven Empirical Approach","confLoc":"Leeds, UK","sourcePdf":"26770083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098951S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4032454","isNumber":"4032455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4032454","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"4032455","articleId":"4032471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4032486,"authors":[{"name":"Alessandro Daidone","affiliation":["ISTI Department, Italian National Council of Research, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Daidone","id":"37840632700"},{"name":"Felicita Di Giandomenico","affiliation":["ISTI Department, Italian National Council of Research, Italy"],"firstName":"Felicita Di","lastName":"Giandomenico","id":"37354962600"},{"name":"Andrea Bondavalli","affiliation":["DSI, University of Florence, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Bondavalli","id":"37265942800"},{"name":"Silvano Chiaradonna","affiliation":["ISTI Department, Italian National Council of Research, Italy"],"firstName":"Silvano","lastName":"Chiaradonna","id":"37265943800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7695-2677-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1060-9857"}],"articleNumber":"4032486","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Quality of service","Monitoring","Fault diagnosis","Bonding","Pattern recognition","Councils","Control systems","Filters","Fault tolerance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","formal verification","hidden Markov models","software fault tolerance","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diagnosis support","information infrastructure","hidden Markov models formalism","diagnosis process formalization","monitored component","deviation detection","state diagnosis"]}],"abstract":"In modern information infrastructures, diagnosis must be able to assess the status or the extent of the damage of individual components. Traditional one-shot diagnosis is not adequate, but streams of data on component behavior need to be collected and filtered over time as done by some existing heuristics. This paper proposes instead a general framework and a formalism to model such over-time diagnosis scenarios, and to find appropriate solutions. As such, it is very beneficial to system designers to support design choices. Taking advantage of the characteristics of the hidden Markov models formalism, widely used in pattern recognition, the paper proposes a formalization of the diagnosis process, addressing the complete chain constituted by monitored component, deviation detection and state diagnosis. Hidden Markov models are well suited to represent problems where the internal state of a certain entity is not known and can only be inferred from external observations of what this entity emits. Such over-time diagnosis is a first class representative of this category of problems. The accuracy of diagnosis carried out through the proposed formalization is then discussed, as well as how to concretely use it to perform state diagnosis and allow direct comparison of alternative solutions","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hidden Markov Models as a Support for Diagnosis: Formalization of the Problem and Synthesis of the Solution","publicationTitle":"2006 25th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS'06)","doi":"10.1109/SRDS.2006.24","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 25th IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems (SRDS'06)","pdfPath":"/iel5/4032454/4032455/04032486.pdf","startPage":"245","endPage":"256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SRDS.2006.24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032455","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032486/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","displayDocTitle":"Hidden Markov Models as a Support for Diagnosis: Formalization of the Problem and Synthesis of the Solution","conferenceDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4032486/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 2006","accessionNumber":"9274821","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hidden Markov Models as a Support for Diagnosis: Formalization of the Problem and Synthesis of the Solution","confLoc":"Leeds, UK","sourcePdf":"26770245.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053933S","chronDate":"2-4 Oct. 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4032454","isNumber":"4032455","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4032454","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4032455","articleId":"4032486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4032607,"authors":[{"name":"Minh-Son Dao","affiliation":["Graphi Tech, Inc., Trento, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/4032598/4032607/4032607-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Minh-Son Dao (M'04) received the B.Sc. degree in computer science in 1995 and the M.Sc. degree in computer science in 2000, both from the University of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam.

This variability of resources does not significantly impact delay insensitive data transmission (e.g., file transfers), but has considerable consequences for multimedia applications. Recently, the research focus has been to adapt existing algorithms and protocols at the lower layers of the protocol stack to better support multimedia transmission applications and conversely, to modify application layer solutions to cope with the varying wireless networks resources. In this paper, we show that significant improvements in wireless multimedia performance can be obtained by deploying a joint application-layer adaptive packetization and prioritized scheduling and MAC-layer retransmission strategy. We deploy a state-of-the-art wavelet coder for the compression of the video data that enables on-the-fly adaptation to changing channel conditions and inherent prioritization of the video bitstream. We pose the cross-layer problem as a distortion minimization given delay constraints and derive analytical solutions by modifying existing joint source-channel coding theory aimed at fulfilling rate, rather than delay, constraints. We also propose real-time algorithms that explicitly consider the available information about previously transmitted packets. The obtained results show significant improvements in terms of video quality as opposed to ad-hoc optimizations currently deployed, while the complexity associated with performing this optimization in real time, i.e., at transmission time, is limited","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/4032598/04032621.pdf","startPage":"185","endPage":"197","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2006.886384","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2006.886384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Packetization and Retransmission Strategies for Delay-Sensitive Wireless Multimedia Transmission","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Streaming media","Quality of service","Video compression","Wireless networks","Wireless application protocol","Constraint theory","Protection","Wavelet packets","Propagation losses"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","combined source-channel coding","mobile radio","multimedia communication","optimisation","quality of service","scheduling","video coding","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer packetization strategy","cross-layer retransmission strategy","delay-sensitive wireless multimedia transmission","quality of service","prioritized scheduling","MAC","wavelet coder","video compression","distortion minimization","joint source-channel coding","ad-hoc optimization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer wireless multimedia transmission","packetization strategies","retransmission","resilient transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032621/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Packetization and Retransmission Strategies for Delay-Sensitive Wireless Multimedia Transmission","volume":"9","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4032621/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9236073","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Packetization and Retransmission Strategies for Delay-Sensitive Wireless Multimedia Transmission","sourcePdf":"09tmm01-vanderschaar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065726S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"4032598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"4032598","articleId":"4032621","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4032626,"authors":[{"name":"Takashi Asano","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Science and Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/2944/4026507/4032626/4032626-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Takashi Asano received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 1992, 1994, and 1997, respectively, all in electronics.","From 1996 to 1998, he was a Research Fellow with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science at Kyoto University.

Cubic wavelength order cavities, with experimental Q factors of 100 000 and nearly 1 000 000 are obtained by tailoring the envelope functions using air-hole shifts and multistep heterostructures, respectively.

The structure consists of a relatively large silicon block on top of a submicrometer dimensional silicon rib waveguide. The block and the waveguide are separated by a thin oxide layer, which acts as an efficient etch stop during fabrication. The optical facet is 5times5 mum (the cross-sectional area of the block at the device edge) and hence provides an efficient overlap with the optical mode of commercially available tapered fiber.

The mid-IR application space is summarized, and the current practice based on the optical parametric oscillators and solid state Raman lasers is discussed. Relevant properties of silicon are compared with popular Raman crystals, and linear and nonlinear transmission measurements of silicon in the mid-IR are presented. It is shown that the absence of the nonlinear losses, which severely limit the performance of the recently demonstrated silicon lasers in the near IR, combined with unsurpassed crystal quality, high thermal conductivity and excellent optical damage threshold render silicon a very attractive Raman medium, even when compared to the very best Raman crystals. In addition, silicon photonic technology, offering integrated low-loss waveguides and microcavities, offers additional advantages over today's bulk crystal Raman laser technology. Using photonic crystal structures or microring resonators, the integrated cascaded microcavities can be employed to realize higher order Stokes emission, and hence to extend the wavelength coverage of the existing pump lasers. Exploiting these facts, the proposed technology can extend the utility of silicon photonics beyond data communication and into equally important applications in biochemical sensing and laser medicine","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4026509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2006.885340","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/4026509/04032661.pdf","startPage":"1618","endPage":"1627","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2006.885340","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Prospects for Silicon Mid-IR Raman Lasers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2006","displayDocTitle":"Prospects for Silicon Mid-IR Raman Lasers","volume":"12","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4032661/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9222177","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032661/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.-dec.  2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Prospects for Silicon Mid-IR Raman Lasers","sourcePdf":"12jstqe06-jalali-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162064S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"4026509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4026509","articleId":"4032661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4032688,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher G.

The loss predicted by this three-dimensional (3-D) model is considerably larger than that calculated using previous treatments that approximate the true 3-D radiation modes with their two-dimensional counterparts. The 3-D radiation modes of the ideal waveguide are expanded in a series of cylindrical harmonics, and the coupling between the guided and radiation modes due to the sidewall perturbation is computed. The waveguide attenuation can then be calculated semianalytically. It is found that the dominant loss mechanism is radiation rather than reflection, and that the transverse electric polarization exhibits much larger attenuation than transverse magnetic polarization. The method also gives simple rules that can be used in the design of low-loss optical waveguides. The structural properties of sidewall roughness of an InGaAs/InP pedestal waveguide are measured using atomic force microscopy, and the measured attenuation is found to compare well with that predicted by the model","doi":"10.1109/JSTQE.2006.881648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/2944/4026507/04032688.pdf","startPage":"1306","endPage":"1321","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTQE.2006.881648","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4026507","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radiation Modes and Roughness Loss in High Index-Contrast Waveguides","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032688","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.-dec.  2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.-dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032688/","displayDocTitle":"Radiation Modes and Roughness Loss in High Index-Contrast Waveguides","volume":"12","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov.-dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9233793","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4032688/","dateOfInsertion":"05 March 2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radiation Modes and Roughness Loss in High Index-Contrast Waveguides","sourcePdf":"12jstqe06-poulton-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074464S","chronDate":"Nov.-dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"2944","isNumber":"4026507","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2944","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"4026507","articleId":"4032688","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4032689,"authors":[{"name":"Dennis W.

By cutting nanoscale nerve connections inside the nematode C. elegans , the feedback loops that control backward motion of the worm can be disconnected. This operation stops the whole worm from moving backward while leaving its forward motion intact. The femtosecond laser-based axotomy creates little peripheral damage so that the cut axons can regrow, and the worms recover and move backward again within one day. We conduct several assays to assess target specificity, damage threshold, and the extent of femtosecond laser axotomy. We also study nerve regeneration in touch neurons, and report an interesting type of nerve regeneration that salvages the severed parts of neurons from degeneration. The use of femtosecond laser pulses as a precise surgical tool allowed, for the first time, observation and study of nerve regeneration in C. elegans with a simple nervous system.

Previous measurement-based approaches use reference hosts, called landmarks, with a well-known geographic location to provide the location estimation of a target host. This leads to a discrete space of answers, limiting the number of possible location estimates to the number of adopted landmarks. In contrast, we propose Constraint-Based Geolocation (CBG), which infers the geographic location of Internet hosts using multilateration with distance constraints to establish a continuous space of answers instead of a discrete one. However, to use multilateration in the Internet, the geographic distances from the landmarks to the target host have to be estimated based on delay measurements between these hosts. This is a challenging problem because the relationship between network delay and geographic distance in the Internet is perturbed by many factors, including queueing delays and the absence of great-circle paths between hosts. CBG accurately transforms delay measurements to geographic distance constraints, and then uses multilateration to infer the geolocation of the target host. Our experimental results show that CBG outperforms previous geolocation techniques. Moreover, in contrast to previous approaches, our method is able to assign a confidence region to each given location estimate. This allows a location-aware application to assess whether the location estimate is sufficiently accurate for its needs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032725/","volume":"14","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4032725/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9239268","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Constraint-Based Geolocation of Internet Hosts","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constraint-Based Geolocation of Internet Hosts","sourcePdf":"14tnet06-gueye.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.112423S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4032714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"146","xplore-issue":"4032714","articleId":"4032725","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4032726,"authors":[{"name":"Huaizhong Han","affiliation":["University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/90/4032714/4032726/4032726-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Huaizhong Han received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from the University of Science and Technology of China in 1998 and 2001, respectively.

Currently, Internet routing protocols select only a single path between a source and a destination. However, due to many policy routing decisions, single-path routing may limit the achievable throughput. In this paper, we envision a scenario where multi-path routing is enabled in the Internet to take advantage of path diversity. Using minimal congestion feedback signals from the routers, we present a class of algorithms that can be implemented at the sources to stably and optimally split the flow between each source-destination pair. We then show that the connection-level throughput region of such multi-path routing/congestion control algorithms can be larger than that of a single-path congestion control scheme","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4032714/04032726.pdf","startPage":"1260","endPage":"1271","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2006.886738","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2006.886738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032714","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032726","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Path TCP: A Joint Congestion Control and Routing Scheme to Exploit Path Diversity in the Internet","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Internet","Bandwidth","Routing protocols","Throughput","Stability","Feedback","Resource management","IP networks","Differential equations","Clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","Internet","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network routing","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multipath TCP","congestion control","routing scheme","exploit path diversity","Internet","congestion-aware multipath routing","single-path routing","minimal congestion feedback signals","source-destination pair","connection-level throughput region"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Congestion control","multipath routing","Nyquist stability","overlay networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032726/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Path TCP: A Joint Congestion Control and Routing Scheme to Exploit Path Diversity in the Internet","volume":"14","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4032726/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9239271","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Path TCP: A Joint Congestion Control and Routing Scheme to Exploit Path Diversity in the Internet","sourcePdf":"14tnet06-han.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066325S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4032714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"243","xplore-issue":"4032714","articleId":"4032726","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":4032736,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivas Shakkottai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Srinivas","lastName":"Shakkottai","id":"37863877700"},{"name":"R.

ISPs that are not co-located may not directly compete for users, but are nevertheless involved in a non-cooperative game of setting access and transit prices for each other.

Recent optimal flow control approaches are unable to deal with these problems since QoS utility functions generally do not satisfy the strict concavity condition in real-time applications. For elastic traffic, we show that bandwidth allocations using the existing optimal flow control strategy can be quite unfair. If we consider different QoS requirements among network users, it may be undesirable to allocate bandwidth simply according to the traditional max-min fairness or proportional fairness. Instead, a network should have the ability to allocate bandwidth resources to various users, addressing their real utility requirements. For these reasons, this paper proposes a new distributed flow control algorithm for multiservice networks, where the application's utility is only assumed to be continuously increasing over the available bandwidth. In this, we show that the algorithm converges, and that at convergence, the utility achieved by each application is well balanced in a proportionally (or max-min) fair manner","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/4032714/04032737.pdf","startPage":"1282","endPage":"1291","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2006.886318","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2006.886318","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032737","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Bandwidth","Resource management","Application software","Optimal control","Computer networks","Communication system traffic control","Channel allocation","Distributed control","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer networks","distributed control","minimax techniques","optimal control","quality of service","resource allocation","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-oriented flow control","resource allocation problems","computer networks","quality of service","real-time applications","QoS","optimal flow control","elastic traffic","bandwidth allocations","max-min fairness","multiservice networks","distributed flow control algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Congestion control","quality of service","real-time application","resource allocation","utility max-min fairness","utility proportional fairness"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032737/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Application-Oriented Flow Control: Fundamentals, Algorithms and Fairness","accessionNumber":"9239273","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4032737/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application-Oriented Flow Control: Fundamentals, Algorithms and Fairness","sourcePdf":"14tnet06-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09963S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"4032714","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"4032714","articleId":"4032737","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4032738,"authors":[{"name":"David X.

Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) has emerged as a high-speed digital platform ideal for such application-specific computations. We propose an efficient and flexible component-based FPGA design framework for neuronal ion channel dynamics simulations, which overcomes certain limitations of the recently proposed memory-based approach. A parallel processing strategy is used to minimize computational delay, and a hardware-efficient factoring approach for calculating exponential and division functions in neuronal ion channel models is used to conserve resource consumption. Performances of the various FPGA design approaches are compared theoretically and experimentally in corresponding implementations of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) synaptic ion channel models.

Goals for optimal design are formulated generically and applied to the mechanical design of an upper-arm exoskeleton. A nine degree-of-freedom (DOF) model of the human arm kinematics is presented and used to develop, test, and optimize the kinematic structure of an human arm interfacing exoskeleton. The resulting device can interact with an unprecedented portion of the natural limb workspace, including motions in the shoulder-girdle, shoulder, elbow, and the wrist. The exoskeleton does not require alignment to the human joint axes, yet is able to actuate each DOF of our redundant limb unambiguously and without reaching into singularities.

Unlike other techniques, it applies auto-regression moving-average (ARMA) filtering directly in the cepstral domain. We call this technique mean subtraction, variance normalization, and ARMA filtering (MVA) post-processing, and speech features with MVA post-processing are called MVA features. Overall, compared to raw features without post-processing, MVA features achieve an error rate reduction of 45% on matched tasks and 65% on mismatched tasks on the Aurora 2.0 noisy speech database, and an average 57% error reduction on the Aurora 3.0 database. These improvements are comparable to the results of much more complicated techniques even though MVA is relatively simple and requires practically no additional computational cost. In this paper, in addition to describing MVA processing, we also present a novel analysis of the distortion of mel-frequency cepstral coefficients and the log energy in the presence of different types of noise. The effectiveness of MVA is extensively investigated with respect to several variations: the configurations used to extract and the type of raw features, the domains where MVA is applied, the filters that are used, the ARMA filter orders, and the causality of the normalization process. Specifically, it is argued and demonstrated that MVA works better when applied to the zeroth-order cepstral coefficient than to log energy, that MVA works better in the cepstral domain, that an ARMA filter is better than either a designed finite impulse response filter or a data-driven filter, and that a five-tap ARMA filter is sufficient to achieve good performance in a variety of settings.

In conventional speech recognition systems, features are generally derived from the short-time magnitude spectrum. Although the importance of Fourier transform phase in speech perception has been realized, few attempts have been made to extract features from it. This is primarily because the resonances of the speech signal which manifest as transitions in the phase spectrum are completely masked by the wrapping of the phase spectrum. Hence, an alternative to processing the Fourier transform phase, for extracting speech features, is to process the group delay function which can be directly computed from the speech signal. The group delay function has been used in earlier efforts, to extract pitch and formant information from the speech signal. In all these efforts, no attempt was made to extract features from the speech signal and use them for speech recognition applications. This is primarily because the group delay function fails to capture the short-time spectral structure of speech owing to zeros that are close to the unit circle in the z-plane and also due to pitch periodicity effects. In this paper, the group delay function is modified to overcome these effects. Cepstral features are extracted from the modified group delay function and are called the modified group delay feature (MODGDF). The MODGDF is used for three speech recognition tasks namely, speaker, language, and continuous-speech recognition. Based on the results of feature and performance evaluation, the significance of the MODGDF as a new feature for speech recognition is discussed","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032772/","volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4032772/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9327522","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Significance of the Modified Group Delay Feature in Speech Recognition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Significance of the Modified Group Delay Feature in Speech Recognition","sourcePdf":"15tasl01-hegde.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092907S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4032760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"88","xplore-issue":"4032760","articleId":"4032772","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":4032773,"authors":[{"name":"Haizhou Li","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/4032760/4032773/4032773-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Haizhou Li (M'91\u2013SM'01) received the B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from the South China University of Technology (SCUT), Guangzhou, in 1984, 1987, and 1990, respectively.","He was a Research Assistant from 1988 to 1990 at the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. in 1990, he joined SCUT as an Associate Professor where he became a Full Professor in 1994. from 1994 to 1995, he was a Visiting Professor at CRIN, France. in 1995, he became the Manager of the ASR group at the Apple-ISS Research Centre, where he led the research of Apple's Chinese Dictation Kit for Macintosh. in 1999, he was appointed as the Research Director of Lernout and Hauspie Asia Pacific, where he oversaw the creation of the world's first multimodal speech, pen, and keyboard input solution for Chinese computing. from 2001 to 2003, he was the Vice President of InfoTalk Corporation, Ltd.

It is assumed that the overall sound characteristics of all spoken languages can be covered by a universal collection of acoustic units, which can be characterized by the acoustic segment models (ASMs). A spoken utterance is then decoded into a sequence of ASM units. The ASM framework furthers the idea of language-independent phone models for LID by introducing an unsupervised learning procedure to circumvent the need for phonetic transcription. Analogous to representing a text document as a term vector, we convert a spoken utterance into a feature vector with its attributes representing the co-occurrence statistics of the acoustic units.

The problem becomes more difficult in very reverberant conditions, with an increasing number of sources, and geometric configurations of the sources such that finding directionality is not sufficient for source separation. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that exploits higher order frequency dependencies of source signals in order to separate them when they are mixed. In the frequency domain, this formulation assumes that dependencies exist between frequency bins instead of defining independence for each frequency bin. In this manner, we can avoid the well-known frequency permutation problem. To derive the learning algorithm, we define a cost function, which is an extension of mutual information between multivariate random variables. By introducing a source prior that models the inherent frequency dependencies, we obtain a simple form of a multivariate score function. In experiments, we generate simulated data with various kinds of sources in various environments. We evaluate the performances and compare it with other well-known algorithms. The results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the others in most cases. The algorithm is also able to accurately recover six sources with six microphones. In this case, we can obtain about 16-dB signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) improvement.

On these tasks, starting from maximum likelihood (ML) baselines, MCE training yielded relative reductions in word error ranging from 7% to 20%.

Accurate estimation of GCIs is an important tool that can be applied to a wide range of speech processing tasks including speech analysis, synthesis and coding. DYPSA is automatic and operates using the speech signal alone without the need for an EGG signal. The algorithm employs the phase-slope function and a novel phase-slope projection technique for estimating GCI candidates from the speech signal.

This suggests that the visual signals of speech (movements of visible articulators) could be used in speech enhancement or extraction systems. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm plugging audiovisual coherence of speech signals, estimated by statistical tools, on audio blind source separation (BSS) techniques. This algorithm is applied to the difficult and realistic case of convolutive mixtures. The algorithm mainly works in the frequency (transform) domain, where the convolutive mixture becomes an additive mixture for each frequency channel. Frequency by frequency separation is made by an audio BSS algorithm. The audio and visual informations are modeled by a newly proposed statistical model. This model is then used to solve the standard source permutation and scale factor ambiguities encountered for each frequency after the audio blind separation stage. The proposed method is shown to be efficient in the case of 2 times 2 convolutive mixtures and offers promising perspectives for extracting a particular speech source of interest from complex mixtures","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixing Audiovisual Speech Processing and Blind Source Separation for the Extraction of Speech Signals From Convolutive Mixtures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2006.872619","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4032760/04032792.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"108","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2006.872619","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032760","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032792/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Mixing Audiovisual Speech Processing and Blind Source Separation for the Extraction of Speech Signals From Convolutive Mixtures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4032792/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9327515","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixing Audiovisual Speech Processing and Blind Source Separation for the Extraction of Speech Signals From Convolutive Mixtures","sourcePdf":"15tasl01-rivet.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098725S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4032760","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4032760","articleId":"4032792","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4032793,"authors":[{"name":"Michael L.

A more economical approach is to collect telephone speech and then restrict the application to operate at the telephone bandwidth. However, this generally results in suboptimal performance compared to a wideband recognition system. In this paper, we propose a novel expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm in which wideband acoustic models are trained using a small amount of wideband speech and a larger amount of narrowband speech. We show how this algorithm can be incorporated into the existing training schemes of hidden Markov model (HMM) speech recognizers.

The proposed method consists of two steps. The first step is a view interpolation to reconstruct an all-in-focus dense light field of the scene. The second step is to synthesize a novel view by a light-field rendering technique from the reconstructed dense light field. The view interpolation in the first step can be achieved simply by linear filters that are designed to shift different object regions separately, without region segmentation. The proposed method can effectively create a dense array of pin-hole cameras (i.e., all-in-focus images), so that the novel view can be synthesized with better quality","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4032799/04032816.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"279","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.884938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.884938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032799","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconstructing Dense Light Field From Array of Multifocus Images for Novel View Synthesis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Optical arrays","Cameras","Layout","Interpolation","Focusing","Apertures","Rendering (computer graphics)","Nonlinear filters","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image reconstruction","interpolation","rendering (computer graphics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dense light field reconstruction","multifocus images array","aperture camera array","constant depths","all-in-focus dense light field","light-field rendering technique","interpolation","pin-hole cameras"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blur","image-based rendering (IBR)","light-field rendering (LFR)","spatial invariant filter","view interpolation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Imaging, Three-Dimensional","Information Storage and Retrieval","Photogrammetry"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032816/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Reconstructing Dense Light Field From Array of Multifocus Images for Novel View Synthesis","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4032816/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9261420","pubMedId":"17283785","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconstructing Dense Light Field From Array of Multifocus Images for Novel View Synthesis","sourcePdf":"16tip01-kubota.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062732S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4032799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4032799","articleId":"4032816","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4032818,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Li","affiliation":["Video and Image Processing Laboratory (VIPER), School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4032799/4032818/4032818-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhen Li (S'01\u2013M'05) received the B.E. degree in 2000 from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in 2005 from Purdue University, West Lafayette, both in electrical engineering.","He joined Thomson Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ, in 2005, where he is currently a member technical staff.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to solve the supervised dimensionality reduction problem by encoding an image object as a general tensor of second or even higher order. First, we propose a discriminant tensor criterion, whereby multiple interrelated lower dimensional discriminative subspaces are derived for feature extraction. Then, a novel approach, called k-mode optimization, is presented to iteratively learn these subspaces by unfolding the tensor along different tensor directions. We call this algorithm multilinear discriminant analysis (MDA), which has the following characteristics: 1) multiple interrelated subspaces can collaborate to discriminate different classes, 2) for classification problems involving higher order tensors, the MDA algorithm can avoid the curse of dimensionality dilemma and alleviate the small sample size problem, and 3) the computational cost in the learning stage is reduced to a large extent owing to the reduced data dimensions in k-mode optimization. We provide extensive experiments on ORL, CMU PIE, and FERET databases by encoding face images as second- or third-order tensors to demonstrate that the proposed MDA algorithm based on higher order tensors has the potential to outperform the traditional vector-based subspace learning algorithms, especially in the cases with small sample sizes","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.884929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4032799/04032832.pdf","startPage":"212","endPage":"220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.884929","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multilinear Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032832/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multilinear Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition","volume":"16","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"9261414","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","pubMedId":"17283779","htmlLink":"/document/4032832/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilinear Discriminant Analysis for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"16tip01-yan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078694S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4032799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"254","xplore-issue":"4032799","articleId":"4032832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4032834,"authors":[{"name":"Baochang Zhang","affiliation":["Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4032799/4032834/4032834-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Baochang Zhang received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 1999 and 2001, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include pattern recognition, machine learning, face recognition, and wavelets."]},"firstName":"Baochang","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405129100"},{"name":"Shiguang Shan","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy and Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4032799/4032834/4032834-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Shiguang Shan (M'04) received the M.S. degree in computer science from the Harbin Institute of Computing Technology, Harbin, China, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Institute of Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Beijing, China, in 2004.","He is currently an Associate Researcher and serves as the Vice Director of the Digital Media Center, Institute of Computing Technology, CAS.

In HGPP, the quadrant-bit codes are first extracted from faces based on the Gabor transformation. Global Gabor phase pattern (GGPP) and local Gabor phase pattern (LGPP) are then proposed to encode the phase variations. GGPP captures the variations derived from the orientation changing of Gabor wavelet at a given scale (frequency), while LGPP encodes the local neighborhood variations by using a novel local XOR pattern (LXP) operator. They are both divided into the nonoverlapping rectangular regions, from which spatial histograms are extracted and concatenated into an extended histogram feature to represent the original image. Finally, the recognition is performed by using the nearest-neighbor classifier with histogram intersection as the similarity measurement. The features of HGPP lie in two aspects: 1) HGPP can describe the general face images robustly without the training procedure; 2) HGPP encodes the Gabor phase information, while most previous face recognition methods exploit the Gabor magnitude information. In addition, Fisher separation criterion is further used to improve the performance of HGPP by weighing the subregions of the image according to their discriminative powers. The proposed methods are successfully applied to face recognition, and the experiment results on the large-scale FERET and CAS-PEAL databases show that the proposed algorithms significantly outperform other well-known systems in terms of recognition rate","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2006.884956","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4032799/04032834.pdf","startPage":"57","endPage":"68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2006.884956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032799","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Histogram of Gabor Phase Patterns (HGPP): A Novel Object Representation Approach for Face Recognition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032834","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032834/","displayDocTitle":"Histogram of Gabor Phase Patterns (HGPP): A Novel Object Representation Approach for Face Recognition","volume":"16","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9261400","pubMedId":"17283765","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4032834/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Histogram of Gabor Phase Patterns (HGPP): A Novel Object Representation Approach for Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"16tip01-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081018S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4032799","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"420","xplore-issue":"4032799","articleId":"4032834","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":4032851,"authors":[{"name":"Jungho Kim","affiliation":["Institut f\u00fcr Festk\u00f6rperphysik, Technische Universit\u00e4t Berlin, Berlin, Germany","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Jungho","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281200900"},{"name":"Shun Lien Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Shun Lien","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37272720600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"4032851","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4032851","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum dots","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Wavelength measurement","Bandwidth","Charge carrier density","Optical wavelength conversion","Stationary state","Doping","Semiconductor process modeling","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier density","optical modulation","quantum dot lasers","semiconductor doping","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-gain modulation","quantum-dot semiconductor optical amplifiers","pump-probe detuning wavelength","carrier density","small-signal conversion efficiency","carrier relaxation time","XGM","QD SOA","p-doping","excited state","ground state","3.5 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-gain modulation","quantum dot","semiconductor optical amplifiers","wavelength conversion"]}],"abstract":"The small-signal cross-gain modulation (XGM) characteristics of a p-doped quantum-dot (QD) semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) are measured and compared with a theoretical model.

In this paper, transition-movement models (TMMs) are proposed to handle transition parts between two adjacent signs in large-vocabulary continuous SLR. For tackling mass transition movements arisen from a large vocabulary size, a temporal clustering algorithm improved from k-means by using dynamic time warping as its distance measure is proposed to dynamically cluster them; then, an iterative segmentation algorithm for automatically segmenting transition parts from continuous sentences and training these TMMs through a bootstrap process is presented. The clustered TMMs due to their excellent generalization are very suitable for large-vocabulary continuous SLR. Lastly, TMMs together with sign models are viewed as candidates of the Viterbi search algorithm for recognizing continuous sign language. Experiments demonstrate that continuous SLR based on TMMs has good performance over a large vocabulary of 5113 Chinese signs and obtains an average accuracy of 91.9%","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4032912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCA.2006.886347","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A: Systems and Humans","pdfPath":"/iel5/3468/4032912/04032919.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2006.886347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Large-Vocabulary Continuous Sign Language Recognition Based on Transition-Movement Models","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Large-Vocabulary Continuous Sign Language Recognition Based on Transition-Movement Models","volume":"37","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4032919/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9255875","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4032919/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Large-Vocabulary Continuous Sign Language Recognition Based on Transition-Movement Models","sourcePdf":"37tsmca01-fang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06822S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"3468","isNumber":"4032912","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3468","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4032912","articleId":"4032919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4032930,"authors":[{"name":"Yi-Chun Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, China Three Gorges University, Yichang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3468/4032912/4032930/4032930-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yi-Chun Xu was born in Hubei, China, in 1970.

For such human-in-the-loop systems, this paper implements a hierarchical supervision system to guarantee that remote human-issued commands meet required specifications. In the presented scheme, Petri nets are applied to model, design, and verify both the local controller and the remote supervisor. Then, the agent technology is adopted to implement the supervisor as an intelligent agent for an online supervision of the remote control system. Hence, undesired resource conflicts and deadlock states can be avoided.

The proposed framework uses computationally cheap hierarchical surrogate models constructed through online learning to replace the exact computationally expensive objective functions during evolutionary search. At the first level, the framework employs a data-parallel Gaussian process based global surrogate model to filter the evolutionary algorithm (EA) population of promising individuals. Subsequently, these potential individuals undergo a memetic search in the form of Lamarckian learning at the second level. The Lamarckian evolution involves a trust-region enabled gradient-based search strategy that employs radial basis function local surrogate models to accelerate convergence. Numerical results are presented on a series of benchmark test functions and on an aerodynamic shape design problem. The results obtained suggest that the proposed optimization framework converges to good designs on a limited computational budget.

To help evaluate this potential and to provide information to help guide technology selection, a physics-based model of a power train for an electric ship has been developed and implemented on three modeling platforms. Using this model, three different investigations have been carried out to explore aspects of the behavior of a rotating machine power source for a shipboard rail launcher. These were: 1) influence of rapid charging of the rotating machine system on the ship power system; 2) use of the stored energy in the rotating machines to improve ship power quality; and 3) use of the stored energy in the rotating machines to power a pulsed free-electron laser. Each study highlighted different integration opportunities and challenges. The first showed that, because the charging of the rail launchers was through 5-MW motors, there could be a voltage sag for a few cycles, but this could easily be managed so that the sag could be reduced to an inconsequential level. The second study showed that, with appropriate power electronics, the stored energy in the rail launcher power supply can be used to correct power quality problems introduced by other ship systems. Finally, the stored energy in the launcher power supply can be used to fire a free electron laser for ship defense. This feature opens the possibility of routine operation of the entire ship at highest efficiency, i.e., with the smallest number of gas turbines operating near full power, while providing stored energy needed for ship defense","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2006.887676","startPage":"450","endPage":"455","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel5/20/4033014/04033044.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2006.887676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4033014","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordination of Large Pulsed Loads on Future Electric Ships","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Marine vehicles","Rotating machines","Power system modeling","Rails","Pulse power systems","Power quality","Free electron lasers","Power lasers","Voltage fluctuations","Power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric motors","electric vehicles","electromagnetic launchers","gas turbines","ships"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large pulsed loads","electric ships","power train","rotating machine power source","shipboard rail launcher","ship power quality","power supply","gas turbines","ship defense"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electric ship","energy storage","power system","pulse loads"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4033044/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Coordination of Large Pulsed Loads on Future Electric Ships","volume":"43","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4033044/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9257986","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coordination of Large Pulsed Loads on Future Electric Ships","sourcePdf":"43tmag01-domaschk-pt2.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03576S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"4033014","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"4033014","articleId":"4033044","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":4033054,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Electrical energy is the main driving source for the electromagnetic launcher. In recent years, much effort has been focused on the improvement of EML technology. To date, most studies involving electromagnetic launchers assume an estimated velocity profiles and calculate the force acting upon the armature with an approximation. The purpose of this study is to calculate the force distribution (thrusting and vertical forces) acting upon the armature. In addition, a more accurate method is utilized to determine the velocity variation with respect to time and position. In our formulation of governing, nonlinear differential equations, Maxwell equations are applied to the rails and the armature. The current field distribution of the rails and the armature as well as the total force distribution acting upon the armature are calculated while temperature and thermophysical properties of the armature and the rails are varying. Finally at different time the velocity variation is determined. A finite-difference code based on the alternative directional implicit method is utilized to solve the nonlinear governing differential equations.

A magnetic drive unit is used for vertical motion of the magnet. Eddy-current distribution in the plate is calculated by solving diffusion equation for vector magnetic potential. The eddy force applied to the object is derived by a coil model representation.

It is well known that for the identification of weakly nonlinear systems, despite the spectral regrowth, it suffices to sample the input-output (I/O) data of the system at the Nyquist rate of the input signal. Many applications such as linearization and mixed-signal simulations require system models at a higher sampling rate than Nyquist. Up to now, the construction of such high-rate models has been done by oversampling the corresponding I/O data. This leads to high computational complexity, ill posedness of the estimation, and high demand on the analog-to-digital-converter sampling rate for the implementation.

The analog filter functions as a simultaneous low-pass and bandpass filter to generate the data and its slope, respectively. Peaking is introduced in the low-pass data path to equalize a lossy channel. The timing recovery loop utilizes the equalized data and slope signals obtained from the dual-function analog filter to recover a clock based on a modified minimum mean squared error (MMSE) criterion. Unlike previously published baud-rate techniques for multigigabit per second nonreturn-to-zero data, this technique can lock to either random or alternating data patterns, even from a closed eye.

The technique combines a novel dual-sampling flip-flop (DSFF) and the skewed CMOS (SCMOS) circuit style. The DSFF and SCMOS are designed to eliminate SETs with the polarity of 1rarr0 and 0rarr1, respectively. We study inverter chain circuits as well as sum-of-products implementation of random logic circuits in a typical 0.18-mum process under the influence of radiation induced soft errors. We quantify the SET tolerance of the proposed technique by using an error map and a recently developed tool soft-error rate analyzer (SERA). The results show that the DSFF incurs no speed penalty, if no SETs have reached the input of DSFF. Otherwise, the DSFF alone eliminates the 1rarr0 SETs while incurring a worst case speed and power penalty of 310 ps and 39 muW, respectively. The SCMOS eliminates the 0rarr1 SETs when the skewing factor is greater than four. Thus, the proposed technique potentially eliminates the impact of SETs with both polarities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Single event upset","Flip-flops","Latches","Protection","Combinational circuits","Logic circuits","Redundancy","Inverters","Integrated circuit reliability","Power system reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","combinational circuits","flip-flops","integrated circuit reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational logic circuit","flip-flops","integrated-circuit reliability","single-event transient","soft-error tolerance","CMOS design","0.18 micron"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Combinational logic circuit","flip-flop","integrated- circuit reliability","latch","single-event transient (SET)","soft-error rate (SER)"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2006.883829","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel5/8920/4033140/04033176.pdf","startPage":"1461","endPage":"1465","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4033140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2006.883829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Sampling Skewed CMOS Design for Soft-Error Tolerance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4033176","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Sampling Skewed CMOS Design for Soft-Error Tolerance","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4033176/","volume":"53","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4033176/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9261476","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Sampling Skewed CMOS Design for Soft-Error Tolerance","sourcePdf":"53tcsii12-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056114S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4033140","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4033140","articleId":"4033176","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4033184,"authors":[{"name":"Oluwole A.

There are, as outlined in the ITRS roadmap, numerous challenges ahead for commercial industry in its effort to track Moore's Law down to the 45 nm node and beyond. While many of the classical threats posed by ionizing radiation exposure have diminished by aggressive semiconductor scaling, the question remains whether there may be unknown, potentially worse threats lurking in the deep submicron regime. This manuscript provides a basic overview of some of the materials, devices, and designs that are being explored or, in some cases, used today. An overview of radiation threats and how radiation effects can be characterized is also presented. Last, the paper provides a detailed discussion of what we know now about how modern devices and materials respond to radiation and how we may assess, through the use of advanced analysis and modeling techniques, the relative hardness of future technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4033191/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","volume":"53","issue":"6","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9257711","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4033191/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Total-Ionizing-Dose Effects in Modern CMOS Technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Total-Ionizing-Dose Effects in Modern CMOS Technologies","sourcePdf":"53tns06-barnaby-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130741S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4033181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"356","xplore-issue":"4033181","articleId":"4033191","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":4033208,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The proposed design does require a 60% increase in area and double the power, but is faster than conventional DICE-based latch design","doi":"10.1109/TNS.2006.884970","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/23/4033181/04033284.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4033181","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNS.2006.884970","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nuclear Science","startPage":"3386","endPage":"3391","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Event Tolerant Latch Using Cascode-Voltage Switch Logic Gates","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4033284","pubTopics":[{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2006","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Single-Event Tolerant Latch Using Cascode-Voltage Switch Logic Gates","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4033284/","volume":"53","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/4033284/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2006","accessionNumber":"9257749","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Event Tolerant Latch Using Cascode-Voltage Switch Logic Gates","sourcePdf":"53tns06-casey-pt1.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052176S","chronDate":"Dec.  2006","xplore-pub-id":"23","isNumber":"4033181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"23","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4033181","articleId":"4033284","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4033330,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The amount of collected charge and the shape of the transient currents are shown to have a significant impact on the temporal width of propagating transients. Finally, based on our measured data, the threshold LET and the critical transient width for unattenuated propagation are calculated for both bulk and floating body SOI as a function of technology scaling. We show that the threshold LETs and the critical transient widths for bulk and floating body SOI devices are similar. Body ties can be used to harden SOI ICs to digital SET.

Using physics-based equations, this paper shows how to break up each critical transistor into several \"boxes\", each with its own dimensions and critical charge, for the purpose of calculating soft error rate (SER). The Boxes methodology also allows for calculation of SER due to an ion that must simultaneously strike two separated sensitive volumes in order to cause an upset. This can be the dominant upset mechanism for many types of cells such as certain hardened SRAM's and other cells that obtain radiation hardness via extra transistors (such as triple modular redundancy, the DICE latch, etc.).

With respect to classical MAPS, adoption of the above readout method involves a substantial change in the guidelines for the design of the front-end electronics and of the whole elementary cell, in order not to jeopardize the collection efficiency of the sensitive electrode. For the purpose of supporting the feasibility of the proposed solution, the paper discusses some experimental data and simulation results relevant to monolithic CMOS sensor prototypes, fabricated in a 0.13 mum technology, which were designed according to the mentioned rules.

This work analyzes SEU and MBU in a 130 nm CMOS SRAM in which the single-event response shows a strong dependence on the angle of proton incidence. Current proton testing methods do not account for device orientation relative to the proton beam and, subsequently, error rate prediction assumes no angular dependencies.

These devices were irradiated with 10-keV X-rays or subjected to constant voltage stress, and then annealed for ten minute intervals of alternating positive and negative gate bias at temperatures between 25 and 150degC. The resulting oxide-trap and interface-trap charge densities exhibit reversible buildup and annealing that depend strongly on bias and temperature. Additional defect-density growth with time was observed as a result of charge injection into the gate stack during the annealing process. This defect-density growth increases with increasing annealing time and temperature. After irradiation, the most of the reversibility in the charge trapping is due to metastable electron traps in the near-interfacial dielectric layers. After constant voltage stress, the motion, reactions, and trapping of protons at or near the Si/oxynitride interface are more important to the observed device response than are metastable electron traps. This is a result of reduced electron-hole pair creation during low-energy constant-voltage stress, as compared to high-energy X-ray irradiation.

The maternal component in the abdominal ECG signal is a nonlinearly transformed version of the MECG. We use an ANFIS network to identify this nonlinear relationship, and to align the MECG signal with the maternal component in the abdominal ECG signal. Thus, we extract the FECG component by subtracting the aligned version of the MECG signal from the abdominal ECG signal. We validate our technique on both real and synthetic ECG signals. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in extracting the FECG component from abdominal signals of very low maternal to fetal signal-to-noise ratios. The results also show that the technique is capable of extracting the FECG even when it is totally embedded within the maternal QRS complex","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2006.883728","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4033996/04034004.pdf","startPage":"59","endPage":"68","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2006.883728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4033996","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extraction of Fetal Electrocardiogram Using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4034004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Extraction of Fetal Electrocardiogram Using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems","volume":"54","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9257848","pubMedId":"17260856","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4034004/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extraction of Fetal Electrocardiogram Using Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems","sourcePdf":"54tbme01-assaleh.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06235S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4033996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"4033996","articleId":"4034004","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-01"},{"_id":4034065,"authors":[{"name":"Yevgeny Perelman","affiliation":["VLSI Systems Research Center Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4033996/4034065/4034065-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yevgeny Perelman received the B.

Current automatic detection techniques are difficult to assess due to the problems associated with acquiring and labelling newborn electroencephalogram (EEG) data. A realistic model for newborn EEG would allow confident development, assessment and comparison of these detection techniques. This paper presents a model for newborn EEG that accounts for its self-similar and nonstationary nature. The model consists of background and seizure submodels. The newborn EEG background model is based on the short-time power spectrum with a time-varying power law. The relationship between the fractal dimension and the power law of a power spectrum is utilized for accurate estimation of the short-time power law exponent. The newborn EEG seizure model is based on a well-known time-frequency signal model. This model addresses all significant time-frequency characteristics of newborn EEG seizure which include; multiple components or harmonics, piecewise linear instantaneous frequency laws and harmonic amplitude modulation. Estimates of the parameters of both models are shown to be random and are modelled using the data from a total of 500 background epochs and 204 seizure epochs. The newborn EEG background and seizure models are validated against real newborn EEG data using the correlation coefficient. The results show that the output of the proposed models have a higher correlation with real newborn EEG than currently accepted models (a 10% and 38% improvement for background and seizure models, respectively)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/4033996/04034071.pdf","startPage":"19","endPage":"28","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nonstationary Model of Newborn EEG","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2006.886667","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4033996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2006.886667","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4034071","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4034071/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"A Nonstationary Model of Newborn EEG","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9257844","pubMedId":"17260852","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"54","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4034071/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonstationary Model of Newborn EEG","sourcePdf":"54tbme01-rankine.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081269S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"4033996","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"4033996","articleId":"4034071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4034084,"authors":[{"name":"Ji-Jon Sit","affiliation":["Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/4033996/4034084/4034084-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ji-Jon Sit received the B.

We propose a bio-inspired asynchronous interleaved sampling (AIS) algorithm that encodes both envelope and phase information, in a manner that may be suitable for delivery to cochlear implant users. Like standard continuous interleaved sampling (CIS) strategies, AIS naturally meets the interleaved-firing requirement, which is to stimulate only one electrode at a time, minimizing electrode interactions. The majority of interspike intervals are distributed over 1-4 ms, thus staying within the absolute refractory limit of neurons, and form a more natural, pseudostochastic pattern of firing due to complex channel interactions. Stronger channels are selected to fire more often but the strategy ensures that weaker channels are selected to fire in proportion to their signal strength as well. The resulting stimulation rates are considerably lower than those of most modern implants, saving power yet delivering higher potential performance. Correlations with original sounds were found to be significantly higher in AIS reconstructions than in signal reconstructions using only envelope information. Two perceptual tests on normal-hearing listeners verified that the reconstructed signals enabled better melody and speech recognition in noise than those processed using tone-excited envelope-vocoder simulations of cochlear implant processing.

We consider the case where the receiver analog front-end suffers from IQ-imbalance and the local oscillator suffers from carrier-frequency offset (CFO). While the IQ-imbalance results in a mirroring effect, the CFO induces inter-carrier interference (ICI). In addition to ICI, we consider the channel delay spread is larger than the cyclic prefix (CP). This means that inter-block interference (IBI) is present. The frequency-domain equalizer is obtained by transferring a time-domain equalizer (TEQ) to the frequency-domain resulting in a per-tone equalizer (PTEQ). Due to the presence of IQ-imbalance the conventional TEQ (where only one TEQ is applied to the received sequence) is not sufficient to cope with the mirroring effect. A sufficient TEQ consists of two time-domain filters; one applied to the received sequence and another applied to a conjugated version of the received sequence. For the case of IQ-imbalance and CFO, the TEQs are designed according the basis expansion model (BEM) which showed to be able to cope with the ICI problem.

The main advantage of this approach consists in the quadratic form of these criteria: the extraction of one source hence reduces to a simple optimization task for which fast and efficient algorithms are available. The separation of the other sources from the mixture is then carried out by an iterative deflation method. Furthermore, these contrasts are shown to be valid for both independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) and non-i.i.d. source signals.

The basic principle is to transform the received signals to the phase mode and remove the frequency dependency of the individual phase mode through the use of a digital beamforming or compensation network. As a result, the far-field pattern of the array, which is governed by a set of variable beamformer weights, is electronically steerable, and it is approximately invariant over a wider range of frequencies than conventional uniform circular arrays (UCAs). This also makes it possible to design the compensation network and the beamformer weights separately. The design of the compensation network is formulated as a second order cone programming (SOCP) problem and is solved optimally for minimax criterion. By employing the beamspace approach using the outputs of a set of fixed UCCA frequency-invariant beamformers (FIBs), a new beamspace MUSIC algorithm is proposed for estimating the direction-of-arrivals (DOAs) of broadband sources. Since the beampatterns of the UCCA-FIB is approximately invariant with frequency and is governed by a small set of weights, a very efficient adaptive beamformer using the minimum variance beamforming (MVB) approach can be developed. Simulation results using broadband Gaussian and multisinusoidal inputs show that the proposed adaptive UCCA-FIB is numerically better conditioned than the conventional broadband tapped-delay-line-based adaptive beamformers, due to the FI property and significantly fewer numbers of adaptive parameters. Consequently, a higher output signal-to-inference-plus-noise ratio over the conventional tapped-delay-line approach is observed. The usefulness of the proposed UCCA-FIB in broadband DOA estimation is also verified by computer simulation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Uniform Concentric Circular Arrays With Frequency-Invariant Characteristics\u2014Theory, Design, Adaptive Beamforming and DOA Estimation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.882109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4034092/04034131.pdf","startPage":"165","endPage":"177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.882109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4034092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4034131","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4034131/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Uniform Concentric Circular Arrays With Frequency-Invariant Characteristics\u2014Theory, Design, Adaptive Beamforming and DOA Estimation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4034131/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9261308","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Uniform Concentric Circular Arrays With Frequency-Invariant Characteristics\u2014Theory, Design, Adaptive Beamforming and DOA Estimation","sourcePdf":"55tsp01-chan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102947S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4034092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4034092","articleId":"4034131","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4034151,"authors":[{"name":"Cssio B.

Such estimators are needed in propagation studies where extensive channel measurements and sounding are required. These are seminal tasks in the process of developing advanced channel models. The proposed method employs an angular von Mises distribution model which is appropriate for angular data observed in channel measurement campaigns. The signal model is stochastic, and consequentially the method is particularly useful for estimation of the diffuse scattering component. This approach leads to lower complexity and faster convergence in comparison to deterministic models. These benefits are due to lower dimensionality of the model, leading to a simpler optimization problem. The statistical performance of the estimator is studied by establishing the Crameacuter-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and comparing the variances. The simulations show that the variance of the proposed estimation technique reaches the CRLB for relatively small sample size. The estimator is robust in the sense that meaningful results are obtained when applied to data generated by channel models other than the one used in its derivation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4034092/04034151.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2006.882057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2006.882057","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4034092","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4034151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic Maximum-Likelihood Method for MIMO Propagation Parameter Estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO","Parameter estimation","Acoustic scattering","Acoustic propagation","Power system modeling","Convergence","Multidimensional signal processing","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","maximum likelihood estimation","MIMO communication","radiowave propagation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic maximum-likelihood method","MIMO propagation","parameter estimation","multiple-input multiple-output channels","channel measurements","angular von Mises distribution","Cramer-Rao lower bound","diffuse scattering component"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel sounding","parameter estimation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4034151/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic Maximum-Likelihood Method for MIMO Propagation Parameter Estimation","volume":"55","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4034151/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9261296","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic Maximum-Likelihood Method for MIMO Propagation Parameter Estimation","sourcePdf":"55tsp01-cribeiro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135314S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4034092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4034092","articleId":"4034151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4034167,"authors":[{"name":"Nathan A.

Single-carrier cyclic-prefixed (SCCP) modulation is similar to OFDM, but with all frequency-domain operations performed at the receiver. Systems employing OFDM and SCCP perform well in the presence of multipath provided that the channel delay spread is shorter than the guard interval between transmitted blocks. If this condition is not met, a channel-shortening equalizer can be used to shorten the channel to the desired length. In modestly time-varying environments, an adaptive channel shortener is of interest. All existing adaptive channel shorteners require renormalization to restrain the channel shortener away from zero. In this paper, we study the use of a unit-tap constraint rather than a unit-norm constraint on the adaptive channel shortener. We use this constraint to manipulate existing algorithms into a framework analogous to the recursive least squares algorithm, and we develop adaptation rules for blind and semiblind frequency domain equalizers for SCCP receivers.

This paper presents an adaptive notch filter (ANF) to achieve both these objectives. For noise reduction purpose, the proposed adaptive filter successfully extracts a single sinusoid of a possibly time-varying nature from a noise-corrupted signal. The paper proceeds with introducing a chain of filters which is capable of estimating the fundamental frequency of a signal composed of harmonically related sinusoids, and of decomposing it into its constituent components. The order of differential equations governing this algorithm is 2n+1, where n is the number of constituent sinusoids that should be extracted. Stability analysis of the proposed algorithm is carried out based on the application of the local averaging theory under the assumption of slow adaptation. When compared with the conventional Fourier analysis, the proposed method provides instantaneous values of the constituting components. Moreover, it is adaptive with respect to the fundamental frequency of the signal.

In time reversal, the backscatter of a signal transmitted into a scattering environment is recorded, delayed, energy normalized, and retransmitted through the medium. We consider two versions of the test-target channel frequency response assumed known or unknown-and, for each version, contrast two approaches: conventional detection (where no time reversal occurs) and time reversal detection. This leads to four alternative formulations for which we derive the optimal detector and the generalized likelihood ratio test, when the target channel frequency response is known or unknown, respectively. We derive analytical expressions for the error probabilities and the threshold for all detectors, with the exception of the time reversal generalized likelihood ratio test. Experiments with real-world electromagnetic data for two channels (free space with a target immersed in 20 scatterers and a duct channel) confirm the analytical results and show that time reversal detection provides significant gains over conventional detection. This gain is explained by the empirical distribution or type of the target channel frequency response-richer scattering channels induce types with heavier tails and larger time reversal detection gains","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4034211/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"19 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4034211/","dateOfInsertion":"19 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9261310","volume":"55","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection by Time Reversal: Single Antenna","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection by Time Reversal: Single Antenna","sourcePdf":"55tsp01-moura.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085411S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4034092","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"115","xplore-issue":"4034092","articleId":"4034211","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4034215,"authors":[{"name":"Chandra R.

EGT is a beamforming technique that maximizes the MISO channel capacity when there is an equal power-per-antenna constraint at the transmitter, and requires the feedback of t-1 phase angles, when there are t antennas at the transmitter. In this paper, we contrast two popular approaches for quantizing the phase angles: vector quantization (VQ) and scalar quantization (SQ). On the VQ side, using the capacity loss with respect to EGT with perfect channel information at transmitter as performance metric, we develop a criterion for designing the beamforming codebook for quantized EGT (Q-EGT). We also propose an iterative algorithm based on the well-known generalized Lloyd algorithm, for computing the beamforming vector codebook. On the analytical side, we study the performance of Q-EGT and derive closed-form expressions for the performance in terms of capacity loss and outage probability in the case of i.i.d. Rayleigh flat-fading channels. On the SQ side, assuming uniform scalar quantization and i.i.d. Rayleigh flat-fading channels, we derive the high-resolution performance of quantized EGT and contrast the performance with that of VQ.

Exact symbol-error-rate (SER) expressions for an arbitrary N-node network employing M'ary phase-shift-keying (MPSK) modulation or quadrature-amplitude modulation (QAM) are provided for the proposed class of protocols. Further, approximate expressions for the SER are derived and shown to be tight at high enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our analysis reveals an interesting result: The class of cooperative protocols shares the same asymptotic performance at high enough SNR and does not depend on m, the number of previous nodes involving in coherent detection, hence, the asymptotic performance of a simple cooperative scenario in which each relay combines the signals from the source and the previous relay is exactly the same as that for a much more complicated scenario in which each relay combines the signals from the source and all the previous relays. The theoretical results also confirm that full diversity equal to the number of cooperating nodes is indeed achievable by the proposed protocols. Finally, we formulate a power-allocation problem in order to minimize the SER of the system. The analysis shows that the optimum power allocation at different nodes follows a certain ordering, and that the power-allocation scheme at high SNR does not depend on the channel quality of the direct link between the source and the destination. Closed-form solutions for the optimal power-allocation problem are provided for some network topologies.

However, available adaptive nonlinear predistorters using indirect learning are sensitive to measurement noise and do not perform optimally. Other available types are either slow to converge, complicated in structure and computationally expensive, or do not consider the memory effects in nonlinear systems such as a high power amplifier (HPA). In this paper, we first propose several novel adaptive nonlinear predistorters based on direct learning algorithms - the nonlinear filtered-x RLS (NFXRLS) algorithm, the nonlinear adjoint LMS (NALMS) algorithm, and the nonlinear adjoint RLS (NARLS) algorithm. Using these new learning algorithms, we design adaptive nonlinear predistorters for an HPA with memory effects or for an HPA following a linear system. Because of the direct learning algorithm, these novel adaptive predistorters outperform nonlinear predistorters that are based on the indirect learning method in the sense of normalized mean square error (NMSE), bit error rate (BER), and spectral regrowth. Moreover, our developed adaptive nonlinear predistorters are computationally efficient and/or converge rapidly when compared to other adaptive nonlinear predistorters that use direct learning, and furthermore can be easily implemented. We further simplify our proposed algorithms by exploring the robustness of our proposed algorithm as well as by examining the statistical properties of what we call the \"instantaneous equivalent linear\" (IEL) filter.

In this paper we address several aspects of the issue through a study of more than 3,000 Amazon customer reviews of the controversial bestseller The Da Vinci Code, including 1,738 positive and 918 negative reviews. The study is motivated by critical questions such as: what are the differences between positive and negative reviews? What is the origin of a particular opinion? How do these opinions change over time? To what extent can differentiating features be identified from unstructured text? How accurately can these features predict the category of a review? We first analyze terminology variations in these reviews in terms of syntactic, semantic, and statistic associations identified by TermWatch and use term variation patterns to depict underlying topics. We then select the most predictive terms based on log likelihood tests and demonstrate that this small set of terms classifies over 70% of the conflicting reviews correctly. This feature selection process reduces the dimensionality of the feature space from more than 20,000 dimensions to a couple of hundreds. We utilize automatically generated decision trees to facilitate the understanding of conflicting opinions in terms of these highly predictive terms.

As researchers begin to develop visual analytic environments, it is advantageous to develop metrics and methodologies to help researchers measure the progress of their work and understand the impact their work has on the users who work in such environments. This paper presents five areas or aspects of visual analytic environments that should be considered as metrics and methodologies for evaluation are developed. Evaluation aspects need to include usability, but it is necessary to go beyond basic usability.

Since the transmitter is nomadic, the agents do not have any decoding ability. These agents process their channel observations and forward it to the final destination through lossless links with a fixed given capacity. Assuming Gaussian signalling, we get lower and upper bounds on the achievable rates, and demonstrate the achievability of the full multiplexing gain. We also extend the model to address multi-user systems. The asymptotic setting with numbers of agents and transmitter's antennas taken to infinity is examined, and the incompetence of the simple compression when compared to a Wyner-Ziv scheme is demonstrated.

It is commonly accepted in the literature that the addition of transmitter information (CSIT) to receiver information (CSIR) provides better performance than receiver information alone. In this work, we examine the performance of a symmetric, single-input, multiple-output (SIMO) channel in which CSIT is acquired through the use of training symbols, and we have a genie-aided receiver. We give a closed form expression for outage probability at high SNR while accounting for the resources consumed by training. We also analyze the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff and find that, though the diversity falls far below that of systems with perfect CSIT, it is still sufficiently superior to that achieved by CSIR-only systems to justify the cost of training. We show that, at zero multiplexing, transmitter training doubles the diversity order of a CSIR-only system and offers nonzero diversity at all achievable multiplexing gains","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04035916.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"39","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261593","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4035916","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Case for Transmitter Training","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitters","Fading","Channel state information","Array signal processing","Power control","Additive noise","Gaussian noise","Costs","Random variables","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","multiplexing","probability","radio transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitter training","fading channels","receiver information","transmitter information","single-input multiple-output channel","genie-aided receiver","outage probability","SNR","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","zero multiplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4035916/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"The Case for Transmitter Training","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4035916/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9155974","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Case for Transmitter Training","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-20.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066335S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4035916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4035921,"authors":[{"name":"Young-han Kim","affiliation":["Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Young-han","lastName":"Kim","id":"37280927400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4035921","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"abstract":"The feedback capacity of additive stationary Gaussian noise channels is characterized as the solution to a variational problem. Toward this end, it is proved that the optimal feedback coding scheme is stationary. When specialized to the first-order autoregressive moving-average noise spectrum, this variational characterization yields a closed-form expression for the feedback capacity. In particular, this result shows that the celebrated Schalkwijk-Kailath coding scheme achieves the feedback capacity for the first-order autoregressive moving-average Gaussian channel, positively answering a long-standing open problem studied by Butman, Schalkwijk-Tiernan, Wolfowitz, Ozarow, Ordentlich, Yang-Kavcic-Tatikonda, and others.

Any interior point of the sum-capacity facet can be achieved by time-sharing among corner points or by an alternative method known as rate-splitting. The main purpose of this paper is to find a point on the sum-capacity facet which satisfies a notion of fairness among active users. In one case, the corner point for which the minimum rate of the active users is maximized (max-min corner point) is computed for signaling. In another case, the polymatroid properties are exploited to locate a rate-vector on the sum-capacity facet which is optimally fair in the sense that the minimum rate among all users is maximized (max-min rate). It is shown that the problems of deriving the time-sharing coefficients or rate-splitting scheme can be solved by decomposing the problem to some lower-dimensional subproblems.

Our study for the Gaussian source model extends the dirty paper coding result by Costa to the case of a weighted power constraint with the weights only known to the transmitter. A coding scheme based on fixed codebook variable-partition codes is presented for this problem.

When combined with optimal leaf-finding modules, this upper bound is guaranteed to be tight in terms of the asymptotic order. The Boolean framework proposed herein further admits a composite search for even tighter results.

Small errors are corrected locally within each subgroup.

In this paper we focus on PUFs. In order to show that our estimates are realistic we first generalize Maurer's (1993) result to the ergodic case. Then we focus on the fact that the entropy of a stationary two-dimensional structure is a limit of a series of conditional entropies, a result by Anastassiou and Sakrison (1982). We extend this result to the conditional entropy of one two-dimensional structure given another one.

The relays transmit a vector, which is a transformation of the received vector by a relay-specific unitary transformation. We assume that the relays do not have any channel information, while the destination has only a partial-channel knowledge, by which we mean that destination knows only the relay-to-destination channel. We derive a Chernoff bound on the pairwise error probability and propose code design criteria. A second contribution is the differential encoding and decoding scheme for this setup, which is different from the existing ones. Furthermore, differential codes from cyclic division algebra are proposed that achieve full diversity.

EXIT charts provide a fast and close to accurate prediction of the thresholds of split-LDPC codes for nonuniform sources. The thresholds approximated by fast EXIT chart analysis are very close to those obtained by density evolution (DE) analysis that we recently proposed for split-LDPC codes.

The algorithm is based on a distributed sequential updating where, at each iteration, the users choose their power allocation, one after the other. However, this sequential updating strategy may slow down its convergence time excessively when the number of users is high. In this paper, we propose an alternative distributed algorithm, called simultaneous iterative water-filling algorithm (SIWFA), where at each iteration, all the users update their power allocations simultaneously, rather than sequentially. This reduces the convergence time considerably, specially when the number of users is large. Our main contribution is to provide a unified set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of both IWFA and SIWFA, that are less stringent than those known in the literature for IWFA. These conditions guarantee the convergence of both algorithms also in the presence of spectral mask constraints imposed on the power allocations of the users","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261855","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036033.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"604","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261855","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous Iterative Water-Filling for Gaussian Frequency-Selective Interference Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036033","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036033/","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous Iterative Water-Filling for Gaussian Frequency-Selective Interference Channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9164511","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036033/","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous Iterative Water-Filling for Gaussian Frequency-Selective Interference Channels","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-137.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042458S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036034,"authors":[{"name":"Dirk Slock","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Slock","id":"37266845200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036034","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":114},"abstract":"Since the introduction of the diversity-rate tradeoff by Zheng and Tse for ML reception in frequency-flat MIMO channels, some results have been obtained also for the diversity behavior of suboptimal receivers such as linear and decision-feedback equalizers for frequency-selective SIMO channels. However, these results are limited to infinite length equalizers. Furthermore, so far attention has focused mostly on just diversity order aspects of diversity. In this paper we analyze the diversity of more practical FIR equalizers. We show in particular that in the case of multiple subchannels, the diversity of infinite length filters can also be attained by FIR equalizers of sufficient length. Increasing the filter lengths improves the coding gain though.

We start with a high-rate protograph LDPC code with variable node degrees of at least 3. Lower rate codes are obtained by splitting check nodes and connecting them by degree-2 nodes. This guarantees the linear minimum distance property for the lower-rate codes. Excluding checks connected to degree-1 nodes, we show that the number of degree-2 nodes should be at most one less than the number of checks for the protograph LDPC code to have linear minimum distance. Iterative decoding thresholds are obtained by using the reciprocal channel approximation.

The new generalized LDPC codes are defined by a small number of parameters and cover a large set of code lengths and rates.

The proposed symmetric N user model captures physical layer parameters such as the encoding rate, transmit power and medium access control (MAC) layer metrics such as queue stability. Two alternative medium access strategies are considered: centralized scheduling and ALOHA. Next, a cross-layer approach is taken wherein the maximum stable throughput of the system is achieved by a joint optimization over the MAC parameters (viz., scheduling set size with scheduling and transmission probability with ALOHA) and the encoding rate. Performance comparisons with traditional layered designs are given. It is shown that in the low and high SNR regimes, layered designs are close to optimal whereas in the moderate SNR range, cross-layer designs outperform layered schemes. Exact characterizations of the \"low\" and \"high\" SNR regimes are given quantitatively.

Therefore we can give presently only a bound for the rank in case of binary extension fields","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261736","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261736","startPage":"861","endPage":"865","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036086.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the rank of LDPC matrices constructed by Vandermonde matrices and RS codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036086/","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"On the rank of LDPC matrices constructed by Vandermonde matrices and RS codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9164553","publicationDate":"July 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4036086/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the rank of LDPC matrices constructed by Vandermonde matrices and RS codes","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-190.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062562S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4036087,"authors":[{"name":"Venkat Chandar","affiliation":["Department EECS, MIT Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkat","lastName":"Chandar","id":"37546049200"},{"name":"Emin Martinian","affiliation":["Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Emin","lastName":"Martinian","id":"37284179100"},{"name":"Gregory W.

The proof uses several ideas from earlier works on the problem including the recent converse proof by Weingarten, Steinberg and Shamai. First the duality between Gaussian multiple access and broadcast channels is employed to show that every point on the boundary of the dirty paper coding region can be represented as the optimal solution to a convex optimization problem. Using the optimality conditions for this convex problem, a degraded broadcast channel is constructed for each point. It is then shown that the capacity region for this degraded broadcast channel contains the capacity region of the original channel. Moreover, the same point lies on the boundary of the dirty paper coding region for this degraded channel.

Deploying DPC in real-time systems is, however, impractical. Block diagonalization (BD) is an alternative precoding technique for downlink multiuser MIMO systems, which can eliminate interuser interference at each receiver, at the expense of suboptimal sum capacity vs. DPC. In this paper, we study the sum capacity loss of BD for a fixed channel. We show that 1) if the user channels are orthogonal to each other, then BD achieves the complete sum capacity; and 2) if the user channels lie in a common row vector space, then the gain of DPC over BD can be bounded by the minimum of the number of transmit and receive antennas and the number of users. We also compare the ergodic sum capacity of DPC with that of BD in a Rayleigh fading channel. Simulations show that BD can achieve a significant part of the total throughput of DPC. An upper bound on the ergodic sum capacity gain of DPC over BD is derived, which can be evaluated with a few numerical integrations. With this bound, we can easily estimate how far away BD is from being optimal in terms of ergodic sum capacity, which is useful in directing practical system designs","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261786","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036091.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","startPage":"886","endPage":"890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum Capacity of Multiuser MIMO Broadcast Channels with Block Diagonalization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036091","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sum Capacity of Multiuser MIMO Broadcast Channels with Block Diagonalization","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036091/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9164556","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4036091/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum Capacity of Multiuser MIMO Broadcast Channels with Block Diagonalization","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095045S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036091","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4036092,"authors":[{"name":"Jianqiu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of New Hampshire, Durham, NH, USA"],"firstName":"Jianqiu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38185762700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036092","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":65},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Fading","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Upper bound","H infinity control","Mutual information","Entropy","Gaussian channels","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","fading channels","receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncoherent MIMO channels","channel capacity","multiple-input multiple-output channels","fading channels","receive antennas","independent Euclidean","phase-amplitude-ratio vector","single-input multiple-output","SIMO"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the capacity of non-coherent multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels with memory. A general decomposition for the MIMO mutual information is found first, then asymptotic lower and upper bounds are derived based on the decomposition. It is found that the upper and the lower bound will converge and a MIMO fading number is derived when the number of receive antennas approaches to infinity.

The former corresponds to conventional CDMA while the latter to impulse-radio (IR). Recent work showed that the fully impulsive signal maximizes the average signal to interference ratio (ASIR) in asynchronous multiple user environment. We extend this result to information measures, and show that by adapting the impulsiveness figure (i.e., the number of non zero chips) to the channel conditions, the system can create a favorable interference environment for the other users. In particular, fully impulsive signaling maximizes the Shannon capacity of each user (treating interference from other users as noise). On the other hand, at transmission rates strictly below capacity, less impulsive signaling is better in terms of decoding error probability","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Most Favorable Impulsive Interference for Ternary CDMA","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261798","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036103.pdf","startPage":"942","endPage":"946","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261798","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036103","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036103/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"The Most Favorable Impulsive Interference for Ternary CDMA","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036103/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9164564","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Most Favorable Impulsive Interference for Ternary CDMA","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063012S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036103","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4036105,"authors":[{"name":"Yingbin Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Yingbin","lastName":"Liang","id":"37275171000"},{"name":"H.

This channel generalizes the multiple access channel (MAC) in that the two users also receive channel output. It is assumed that each user views the other user as a wiretapper, and wishes to keep its confidential information as secret as possible from the other user. The level of secrecy of the confidential information is measured by the equivocation rate. The performance measure of interest is the rate-equivocation tuple that includes the common rate, two private rates and two equivocation rates as components. The set that includes all achievable rate-equivocation tuples is referred to as the capacity-equivocation region. For the GMAC with one confidential message set, where only one user (user 1) has private (confidential) information for the destination, inner and outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation region are derived. The outer bound provides a tight converse to the secrecy capacity region, which is the set of all achievable rates with user 2 being perfectly ignorant of confidential messages of user 1, thus establishing the secrecy capacity region. Furthermore, the degraded GMAC with one confidential message set is further studied, and the capacity-equivocation region and the secrecy capacity region are established. For the GMAC with two confidential message sets, where both users have confidential messages for the destination, an inner bound on the capacity-equivocation region is obtained.

An achievable sum rate defines a sum rate that can be achieved in the MIMO multiuser relay channel with zero error probability for any user, hence it is also a lower bound of the capacity of this channel.

In this paper, we propose a model for sparse multipath channels and study coherent MIMO capacity as a function of SNR for a fixed number of antennas. In a recent work, we had shown that the spatial distribution of the sparse multipath has a significant impact on capacity and had also characterized the optimal distribution (the ideal MIMO channel) that maximizes capacity at any operating SNR. In this paper, we refine these results and develop a framework for maximizing MIMO capacity at any SNR by systematically adapting the array configurations (antenna spacings) at the transmitter and receiver to the level of sparsity. Surprisingly, three canonical array configurations are sufficient for near-optimum performance over the entire SNR range. In a scattering environment with randomly distributed paths, the capacity gain due to optimal configuration is directly proportional to the number of antennas at low SNR's. Numerical results based on a realistic physical model are presented to illustrate capacity gains with reconfigurable antenna arrays","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Ideal MIMO Channel: Maximizing Capacity in Sparse Multipath with Reconfigurable Arrays","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261885","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036122.pdf","startPage":"1036","endPage":"1040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036122","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"The Ideal MIMO Channel: Maximizing Capacity in Sparse Multipath with Reconfigurable Arrays","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036122/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9164575","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Ideal MIMO Channel: Maximizing Capacity in Sparse Multipath with Reconfigurable Arrays","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-226.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11284S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036123,"authors":[{"name":"Igor Bjelakovic","affiliation":["Heinrich-Hertz-Chair for Mobile Communications, Berlin University of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Bjelakovic","id":"38229159900"},{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Heinrich-Hertz-Chair for Mobile Communications, Berlin University of Technology, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Boche","id":"37276597900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036123","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Covariance matrix","MIMO","Feedback","Fading","Mobile communication","Communication systems","Channel state information","Transmitters","Receiving antennas","Quantum entanglement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","fading channels","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal input covariance matrices","MIMO systems","covariance feedback","correlated fading","Kronecker product models"]}],"abstract":"We describe the structure of optimal Input covariance matrices for single user multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) communication system with covariance feedback and for general correlated fading.

Then, we propose a number of algorithms for puncturing the codes in a rate compatible manner to construct codes of higher rates. The two most promising ones are the random puncturing search technique and progressive node puncturing. We show that using the techniques in this paper one could construct a high throughput rate compatible family with codes whose rates are in the range from 0.1 to 0.9 and which are within 1 dB from the channel capacity and have good error floors","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261961","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036142.pdf","startPage":"1134","endPage":"1138","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"H-ARQ Rate-Compatible Structured LDPC Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"H-ARQ Rate-Compatible Structured LDPC Codes","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036142/","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9176018","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036142/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"H-ARQ Rate-Compatible Structured LDPC Codes","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-246.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086651S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036142","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4036143,"authors":[{"name":"Jaehong Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Jaehong","lastName":"Kim","id":"37281207800"},{"name":"Woonhaing Hur","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Woonhaing","lastName":"Hur","id":"37839338100"},{"name":"Aditya Ramamoorthy","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Aditya","lastName":"Ramamoorthy","id":"37269688700"},{"name":"Steven W.

Encoding and decoding is done in a row-by-row manner, and is sliding-block decodable. Essentially, the 2-D constraint is turned into a set of independent and relatively simple one-dimensional (1-D) constraints; this is done by dividing the array into fixed-width vertical strips. Each row in the strip is seen as a symbol, and a graph presentation of the respective 1-D constraint is constructed. The maxentropic stationary Markov chain on this graph is next considered: a perturbed version of the corresponding probability distribution on the edges of the graph is used in order to build an encoder which operates in parallel on the strips.

Both full duplex and half duplex relay are considered. In the past, when a fixed rate code word spans a finite number of fading blocks, the capacity is zero. Therefore, a large amount of research has tried to reduce outage probability and increase throughput, such as the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) diversity-and-multiplexing-gain-tradeoff study of relay channels. Differently, the protocol in this paper achieves a significant information rate with asymptotically zero error probability (no outage) when the number of information bits represented by a code word increases to infinity. This performance is achieved by employing rateless codes and acknowledgements so that the destination obtains just enough mutual information to decode. This approach has the advantages that the protocol is not channel statistics dependent, has low complexity, is power efficient, has high performance, and can be easily generalized to other network communication settings","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Low Complexity Protocol for Relay Channels Employing Rateless Codes and Acknowledgement","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.262004","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036164.pdf","startPage":"1244","endPage":"1248","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.262004","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036164","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Low Complexity Protocol for Relay Channels Employing Rateless Codes and Acknowledgement","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036164/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9176023","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Low Complexity Protocol for Relay Channels Employing Rateless Codes and Acknowledgement","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-268.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083274S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4036171,"authors":[{"name":"Hon Fah Chong","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hon Fah","lastName":"Chong","id":"37285477800"},{"name":"Mehul Motani","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Mehul","lastName":"Motani","id":"37278670800"},{"name":"Hari Krishna Garg","affiliation":["Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Hari Krishna","lastName":"Garg","id":"37281044200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036171","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":63},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Probability distribution","Information theory","Broadcasting","Downlink","Interference channels","Ad hoc networks","Mathematical model","Capacity planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","Gaussian channels","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity theorems","two-user Gaussian zigzag channel","discrete memoryless zigzag channel","strong interference","crossover link gain"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036171","abstract":"We consider the two-user Gaussian zigzag channel, where there are two senders and two receivers.

However, they are not often encountered in practice since the assumption of a single propagation eigenmode is only a rough approximation of real propagation environments. To overcome this problem, the paper extends the single-keyhole channel model by introducing a \"multi-keyhole channel\", which includes a number of statistically independent keyholes. Correlated full-rank and rank-deficient multi-keyhole channels are considered in detail. It is shown that under some general conditions the full-rank multi-keyhole channel is asymptotically Rayleigh fading, if the number of keyholes is large. When the number of both Tx and Rx antennas is large, the asymptotic capacity of a rank-deficient multi-keyhole channel is a sum of the capacities of the equivalent single-keyhole channels. The outage capacity distribution of both full-rank and rank-deficient multi-keyhole channels is asymptotically Gaussian.

We use mutual information as the performance criterion because it determines the possible rate of communication when using an outer code. In this context, linear dispersion codes, first proposed by Hassibi and Hochwald, are appealing because of the high mutual information they provide, as well as their simplicity. Because complexity increases with the number of symbols, it may be sensible in some settings to fix the number of symbols sent per data bit. In the dissertation of Y.

The usage of coding for distributed data storage has also been explored. In this work, we study a joint storage and transmission problem, where a source transmits a file to storage nodes whenever the file is updated, and clients read the file by retrieving data from the storage nodes. The cost includes the transmission cost for file update and file read, as well as the storage cost. We show that such a problem can be transformed into a pure flow problem and is solvable in polynomial time using linear programming. Coding is often necessary for obtaining the optimal solution with the minimum cost. However, we prove that for networks of generalized tree structures, where adjacent nodes can have asymmetric links between them, file splitting instead of coding - is sufficient for achieving optimality. In particular, if there is no constraint on the numbers of bits that can be stored in storage nodes, there exists an optimal solution that always transmits and stores the file as a whole. The proof is accompanied by an algorithm that optimally assigns file segments to storage nodes","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036188.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.262068","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.262068","startPage":"1359","endPage":"1363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network Coding for Joint Storage and Transmission with Minimum Cost","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036188/","displayDocTitle":"Network Coding for Joint Storage and Transmission with Minimum Cost","htmlLink":"/document/4036188/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9164616","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network Coding for Joint Storage and Transmission with Minimum Cost","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-292.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055724S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4036189,"authors":[{"name":"Roxana Smarandache","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics and Stat, San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Roxana","lastName":"Smarandache","id":"37283033400"},{"name":"Ali Emre Pusane","affiliation":["Department of EE, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Ali Emre","lastName":"Pusane","id":"37640330500"},{"name":"Pascal O.

In this paper we study the pseudo-codeword problem for the class of LDPC convolutional codes decoded continuously using an iterative, sliding window, message-passing decoder. In particular, for an LDPC convolutional code derived by unwrapping a quasi-cyclic LDPC block code, we show that the free pseudo-weight of the convolutional code is at least as large as the minimum pseudo-weight of the underlying quasi-cyclic code. This result parallels the well-known relationship between the free Hamming distance of convolutional codes and the minimum Hamming distance of their quasi-cyclic counterparts.

We then prove that for expander codes, the active set of any fractional pseudocodeword is smaller by a constant fraction than the active set of any codeword. We exploit this fact to devise a decoding algorithm that provably outperforms the LP decoder for finite blocklengths. It proceeds by guessing facets of the polytope, and resolving the linear program on these facets. While the LP decoder succeeds only if the ML codeword has the highest likelihood over all pseudocodewords, we prove that for expander codes the proposed algorithm succeeds even with a constant number of pseudocodewords of higher likelihood.

The bit error rate (BER) performance of the TTCM coded OFDM systems over both AWGN channel and UWB channel with impulsive noise is evaluated through simulation. The study shows several essential requirements to achieve high data rate transmission for non-Gaussian channels","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.262074","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036194.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.262074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","startPage":"1389","endPage":"1393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Turbo TCM Coded OFDM Systems for Non-Gaussian Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036194","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Turbo TCM Coded OFDM Systems for Non-Gaussian Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036194/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9176035","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4036194/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Turbo TCM Coded OFDM Systems for Non-Gaussian Channels","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-298.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060022S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036194","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036195,"authors":[{"name":"Kibeom Seong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Kibeom","lastName":"Seong","id":"37286910100"},{"name":"Mehdi Mohseni","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Mohseni","id":"37283989900"},{"name":"John M.

If all users have the same priority weight, then the optimized threshold increases as log K minus a second-order term, which is asymptotically bounded between log log K and log log log K. Furthermore, the sum capacity per sub-channel increases as log log K plus a second-order term, which decreases to a constant as log log K/ log K. We then consider two classes of users, each assigned a different weight, and show that the capacity of the low priority group tends to zero.

Under this setting, the relevant fairness criterion is the stabilization of all buffer queues which guarantees a bounded average delay for all users. In the case of perfect CSIT, different linear beamforming schemes are compared with the stability optimal policy based on dirty-paper coding (DPC). It is found that simple linear beamforming schemes with greedy user selection achieve near DPC performance in terms of the average delay. In the case of non-perfect CSIT due to a delayed feedback, we propose a novel greedy beamforming (heuristic) scheme together with \"analog feedback\" of CSI, where each user sends back its estimated channel vector without quantizing and coding.

We generalize the power-bandwidth tradeoff analysis framework to draw insights for a specific form communication under a non-ergodic fading model. In particular, we study the power-bandwidth tradeoff in a one-dimensional slow-fading multi-hop relay network. We characterize the impact of multi-hopping on the statistical properties of the end-to-end conditional mutual information (conditioned on the specific values of the channel fading parameters and therefore treated as a random variable) and on the energy and spectral efficiency measures computed from the conditional mutual information. Our non-ergodic power-bandwidth tradeoff analysis focuses on two asymptotic regimes: (i) Power-limited (low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) regime and (ii) bandwidth-limited (high SNR) regime. In both regimes, we investigate the performance of open-loop (fixed-rate) and closed-loop (rate-adaptive) multi-hop relaying mechanisms in terms of their power-band width tradeoffs and end-to-end outage probabilities.

Unfortunately, its performance is usually inferior to the all-digital solution, consisting of a rate-distortion code for the source followed by a capacity achieving code for the channel. The performance loss of uncoded transmission comes from the fact that except for very special cases, it is impossible to achieve simultaneous matching of source to channel and channel to source by linear means. We show that by combining prediction and modulo-lattice arithmetic, we can match any stationary Gaussian source to any inter-symbol interference, colored-noise Gaussian channel, hence we achieve Shannon's optimum attainable performance R(D) = C. This scheme is based upon a novel analog modulo-lattice solution to the joint source-channel coding problem for a Gaussian Wyner-Ziv source and a dirty-paper channel","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.262126","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036225.pdf","startPage":"1539","endPage":"1543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.262126","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Analog Matching of Colored Sources to Colored Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036225/","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9164639","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036225/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analog Matching of Colored Sources to Colored Channels","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-329.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050694S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4036226,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled A.s.

Specifically, for a system with a large number of users n, we analyze the scaling laws of the sum-rate for the dirty paper coding and for different types of beamforming transmission schemes. When the channel is i.i.d., it has been shown that for large n, the sum rate is equal to M log log n + M log P/M + o(1) where M is the number of transmit antennas, P is the average signal to noise ratio, and o(1) refers to terms that go to zero as n rarr infin. When the channel exhibits some spatial correlation with a covariance matrix R (non-singular with tr(R) = M), we prove that the sum rate of dirty paper coding is M log log n + M log P/M + log det(R) + o(1). We further show that the sum-rate of various beamforming schemes achieves M log log n + M log P/M + M log c + o(1) where c les 1 depends on the type of beamforming. We can in fact compute c for random beamforming proposed in M. Sharif et al. (2005) and more generally, for random beamforming with preceding in which beams are pre-multiplied by a fixed matrix.

The channel between the transmitters and the receivers is Rayleigh flat fading with fading coefficients unknown to both transmitters and receivers. The lower bound is derived from a practicable successive decoding scheme, and when N is significantly larger than K, it approaches the upper bound with increasing coherence length of the fading process. Obviously, in the limit of large coherence lengths, the system becomes coherent and so is trivial. However, the lower and upper bounds of this paper are close to the MIMO capacity even when the system is highly non-coherent. For example, with N = 50, K = 15 and a coherence length of 200, the achievable rate of the successive decoding scheme diverges from the upper bound by just 6%, even when it is only 40% of coherent capacity. At this design point, the scheme achieves a rate of 13 bits/sec/Hz, significantly greater than any current cellular standards","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261542","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036233.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261542","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","startPage":"1579","endPage":"1583","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculating and Achieving Capacity on the Unknown Fading MIMO Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036233","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Calculating and Achieving Capacity on the Unknown Fading MIMO Channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036233/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9176044","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4036233/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculating and Achieving Capacity on the Unknown Fading MIMO Channel","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038617S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036243,"authors":[{"name":"Anders Nilsson","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Telecommunication Theory Group, Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Nilsson","id":"37387404200"},{"name":"Tor M.

Previous approaches assumed a threshold-based link layer model in which a packet transmission is successful if the SINR at the receiver is greater than a fixed threshold. In reality, the mapping from SINR to packet success probability is continuous. Hence, over each hop, for every finite SINR, there is a non-zero probability of packet loss. With this more realistic link model, it is shown that for a broad class of routing and scheduling schemes, a fixed fraction of hops on each route have a fixed non-zero packet loss probability. In a large network, a packet travels an asymptotically large number of hops from source to destination. Consequently, it is shown that the cumulative effect of per-hop packet loss results in a per-node throughput of only O (1/n) (instead of thetas[1/radic(n log n)] as shown previously for the threshold-based link model)","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036255/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"9188088","publicationDate":"July 2006","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036255/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The Impact of Link Layer Model on the Capacity of a Random Ad hoc Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Impact of Link Layer Model on the Capacity of a Random Ad hoc Network","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-359.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05532S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036255","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036258,"authors":[{"name":"Raymond Moberly","affiliation":["San Diego State University, San Diego, USA"],"firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Moberly","id":"37832363800"},{"name":"Michael O'Sullivan","affiliation":["San Diego State University, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"O'Sullivan","id":"37283035800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036258","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":36},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Iterative algorithms","Iron","Artificial intelligence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative soft-decision decoder algorithm","visualization strategy","LDPC codes","iterative belief-propagation"]}],"abstract":"Multiple formulations of the soft-decision decoding algorithm have been published based upon Gallagher's foundational work on LDPC codes (R.

We formulate a Convolutional network code by associating every pair of adjacent channels with a rational power series over the base field, called the local encoding kernel, and every channel with a concomitant global encoding kernel, which is a vector of rational power series.

The MILP is further relaxed to a linear program (LP), which can be readily solved using the standard simplex method. We show that in some cases the solution of the LP is guaranteed to be that of the MILP. The LPD is also extended to the joint detection and decoding of linear block coded MIMO systems.

We show that this region is given by the capacity region of a dual multi-access channel with a noise covariance that depends on the transmit power. We explore this duality to give the asymptotic behavior of the sum-rate for a system with a large number of user, i.e., n rarr infin. It is shown that as long as the estimation error is of fixed (w.r.t n) variance, the sum-capacity is of order M log log n, where M is the number of antennas deployed at the transmitter. We further obtain the sum-rate loss due to the estimation error. Finally, we consider a training-based scheme for block fading MISO Gaussian broadcast channels.

The solution proposed may be summarized as a generic iterative detection scheme for coded interference channels called bit-level equalization and soft detection (BLESD). It is shown that this novel approach avoids the exponential complexity of a posteriori probability (APP) detection by optimizing a closely-related, but much more manageable, objective function called variational free energy. It also fundamentally differs from the conventional symbol detector, in that data symbols are transparent to the new detector. Instead, soft estimates of the bits that make up the symbols are directly and naturally obtained at the detector output, in terms of posterior probabilities given the channel observation, facilitating efficient message-passing in joint detection and decoding","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Detection of M-QAM Symbols via Bit-Level Equalization and Soft Detection","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261813","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036300.pdf","startPage":"1909","endPage":"1913","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261813","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036300","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Detection of M-QAM Symbols via Bit-Level Equalization and Soft Detection","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036300/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9164679","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Detection of M-QAM Symbols via Bit-Level Equalization and Soft Detection","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-404.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049213S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036301,"authors":[{"name":"Javad Kazemitabar","firstName":"Javad","lastName":"Kazemitabar","id":"37320289900"},{"name":"Hamid Jafarkhani","firstName":"Hamid","lastName":"Jafarkhani","id":"37274579200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036301","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference cancellation","Transmitting antennas","Receiving antennas","Block codes","Transmitters","Fading","Wireless communication","Decoding","Modulation coding","Random variables"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","interference suppression","matrix algebra","multiuser detection","radiofrequency interference","Rayleigh channels","receiving antennas","space-time codes","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiuser interference cancellation","four transmit antennas","users detection","wireless Rayleigh fading channel","receive antennas","quasi-orthogonal space-time block codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036301","abstract":"We consider J transmitter units each equipped with N transmit antennas over a wireless Rayleigh fading channel.

It is proved that in this case a receiver with J receive antennas can separate the transmitted signals of all units and provide each unit with the same diversity order of N = 4","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261814","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261814","startPage":"1914","endPage":"1918","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036301.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Interference Cancellation and Detection for Users with Four Transmit Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Interference Cancellation and Detection for Users with Four Transmit Antennas","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036301/","accessionNumber":"9176064","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036301/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Interference Cancellation and Detection for Users with Four Transmit Antennas","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072129S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4036302,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Hui Tan","affiliation":["Institute for Infocomm Research, Singapore"],"firstName":"Peng Hui","lastName":"Tan","id":"37271340100"},{"name":"Lars K.

The performance of the iterative decoding process is investigated based on parallel scheduling of the outer BP algorithm.

Based on the opportunistic beamforming principle, it has been recently shown that the optimal scaling law of the sum-rate with respect to n, for fixed signal to noise ratio and number of transmitting antennas M, (i.e., M log log n) can be achieved by employing a feedback of only one real and one integer number per user. Moreover, it was proved that a linear scaling with respect of M can be guaranteed only if M scales no faster than log n. In this paper, the optimal scaling law of the sum-rate with respect to n is proved to be achievable with only one bit of feedback per user. The proof builds on opportunistic beamforming and binary quantization of the signal to noise plus interference ratio. Moreover, the linear scaling of the sum-rate with M is demonstrated to hold for M growing no faster than log n even with such a reduced feedback.

In this paper, we show that these metrics are intimately related, and consequently, as in the case of outage capacity, the growth rate of throughput with SNR rho is t log rho for a general class of fading channels (with channel state information at the receiver (CSIR) and with or without CSI at the transmitter (CSIT)) whose channel matrix is of rank t with probability one. However, while asymptotically tight affine lower bounds of the form t log rho + 0(1) were recently derived for outage capacity for such channels, in the sense that the limit as rho rarr infin of the difference between the outage capacity and the lower bound is zero, such affine lower bounds are not possible in general for the throughput. Using the t log rho + O(1) bounds on outage capacity however, lower bounds on throughput are specified where the high SNR limit of the ratio of the throughput and its lower bound is unity. These bounds reveal that the throughput optimal outage probability approaches zero as rho rarr infin. An important exception is the scenario where both the transmitter and receiver have CSI under the long-term power constraint (LTPC), for which we obtain a lower bound of the form t log rho + O(1) which is asymptotically tight (in the stronger sense) and interestingly, this lower bound is identical to the asymptotic delay-limited capacity. The throughputs of MISO and SIMO fading channels are extensively analyzed and it is shown that asymptotically, isotropic Gaussian input is throughput optimal, correlation is detrimental whereas increase in the Rice factor is beneficial and that throughput is schur-concave in the correlation eigenvalues","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261822","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036309.pdf","startPage":"1954","endPage":"1958","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261822","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput analysis for MIMO systems in the high SNR regime","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036309","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036309/","displayDocTitle":"Throughput analysis for MIMO systems in the high SNR regime","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9219343","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036309/","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput analysis for MIMO systems in the high SNR regime","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058317S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036309","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4036310,"authors":[{"name":"Meritxell Lamarca","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Meritxell","lastName":"Lamarca","id":"37266547500"},{"name":"Hanqing Lou","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Delaware, USA"],"firstName":"Hanqing","lastName":"Lou","id":"37266768100"},{"name":"Javier Garcia-Frias","affiliation":["Department of ECE, University of Delaware, USA"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Garcia-Frias","id":"38274987800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036310","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":44},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Labeling","MIMO","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Antennas and propagation","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas","Channel coding","Iterative decoding","Binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","channel coding","fading channels","MIMO systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["random labeling","quasi-static fading channels","MIMO channels","channel capacity","multilevel codes","multiple antenna"]}],"abstract":"We introduce a layered scheme based on multilevel codes and random labeling of the MIMO constellation that attains constellation-constrained outage capacity in quasi-static fading channels.

Due to the distributed nature of the primary user's spectral activity, the cognitive receiver does not have full knowledge of the channel used at the transmitter for secondary communication. Tracking the transmitter state at the receiver is therefore a primary issue in such channels. The problem is further complicated as the channel availability changes with time. The tracking uncertainty also makes decoding at the receiver non-trivial. Using genie based outer bounds and training based lower bounds, we estimate the capacity of the secondary link.

The problem is posed as a controlled Markov decision process problem with the goal of minimizing the average transmission power with the constraint on the average delay that can be interpreted as the quality of service (QoS) requirement of a given application. Several structural results on the nature of the optimal randomized policies and costs are derived. In particular, it is shown that number of actions to be considered can be reduced by dividing the rate allocation problem into bit-loading problem across individual antennas and the total rate allocation based on the current buffer and channel state. Further, optimal rate allocation policies are shown to be a mixture of two pure policies that are nondecreasing in the buffer state.

As an application of the result, we provide an analytical expression for the asymptotic system capacity of GMD-based transceivers","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261923","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036341.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","startPage":"2109","endPage":"2113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Asymptotic Geometric Mean of MIMO Channel Eigenvalues","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036341","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Asymptotic Geometric Mean of MIMO Channel Eigenvalues","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036341/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9176089","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4036341/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Asymptotic Geometric Mean of MIMO Channel Eigenvalues","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074562S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036342,"authors":[{"name":"Michel T.

The classical Chase-Pyndiah algorithm seems to be one with the best trade-off between complexity and performance, especially for low error correction capability t (typically 1 or 2) where it is nearly optimal. However, as an algebraic decoding-based algorithm, the lack of codeword diversity is one of its weakness for BTCs with higher error correction capability and/or non binary BTCs. In this paper, we propose an improved iterative decoding algorithm for BTCs. We present a simple sliding encoding-window (SEW) based decoding algorithm which exploits the cyclic and systematic properties of RS and BCH codes. By adding the SEW algorithm to a classical algebraic decoding method, the proposed decoder can easily generate a list of codewords that are close to the decoded codeword. With the codeword diversity, we can compute more reliable soft output necessary in the turbo decoding process, Monte-Carlo simulations of binary and non-binary BTCs are carried out on Gaussian channels. The results show that the algorithm can improve the error performance up to 1.5 dB relative to the conventional Chase-Pyndiah decoder, while the increase in complexity due to the encoding is minor since it is a low-cost process compared to that of algebraic decoding. Compared to the other encoder-based decoding algorithms in the literature, the proposed algorithm has the advantage that there is no requirement to recompute the generator of parity-check matrix by using Gaussian elimination operations, thus a lower computational complexity","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.262019","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036401.pdf","startPage":"2403","endPage":"2407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.262019","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved iterative decoding algorithm for block turbo codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An improved iterative decoding algorithm for block turbo codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9210379","publicationDate":"July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036401/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036401/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved iterative decoding algorithm for block turbo codes","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04473S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4036403,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandar Jovicic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Jovicic","id":"38229325700"},{"name":"Pramod Viswanath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Pramod","lastName":"Viswanath","id":"37271448800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036403","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":170,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":529},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Decoding","Receivers","Interference channels","Interference constraints","Signal to noise ratio","Degradation","Radio transmitters","Character generation","FCC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","encoding","radio receivers","radio transmitters","radiofrequency interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","information-theoretic perspective","interference","transmitter","primary encoder-decoder pair","receivers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036403","abstract":"Cognitive radios have been proposed as a means to implement efficient reuse of the licensed spectrum.

We first establish an upper-bound on the DMT for any half-duplex SAF scheme with an arbitrary number of relays N and number of slots M. Then, we propose a naive SAF scheme that can exploit the potential diversity gain in the high multiplexing gain regime. More precisely, in certain conditions, the naive SAF scheme achieves the proposed DMT upper-bound which tends to the transmit diversity bound when M goes to infinity. In particular, for the two-relay case, the three-slot naive SAF scheme achieves the proposed upper-bound and outperforms the NAF scheme of Azarian et al. for multiplexing gains r les 2/3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Slotted Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Diversity Schemes","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.262049","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036410.pdf","startPage":"2446","endPage":"2450","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.262049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036410","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"On Slotted Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Diversity Schemes","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036410/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9176125","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Slotted Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Diversity Schemes","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058158S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4036411,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Stauffer","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Erik","lastName":"Stauffer","id":"37296074200"},{"name":"Djordje Tujkovic","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Djordje","lastName":"Tujkovic","id":"37268977500"},{"name":"Arogyaswami Paulraj","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Laboratory, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Arogyaswami","lastName":"Paulraj","id":"37278294900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036411","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":39},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Transmitters","Fading","Channel state information","Receiving antennas","Covariance matrix","Information systems","Laboratories","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","covariance matrices","fading channels","MIMO systems","multiplexing","probability","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["partially cooperative MIMO channels","scaled identity transmit covariance","MIMO wireless","MIMO fading channel","SISO channel","transmit antennas","horizontally coded spatial multiplexing","transmit covariance matrix","outage probability","diversity order"]}],"abstract":"Recently, there has been a great deal of interest on the performance of MIMO wireless systems as the MIMO fading channel offers an increase in capacity and reliability over that of a SISO channel. When channel state information is not known at the transmitter, the level of performance obtained depends on the degree of cooperation between the transmit antennas. With no cooperation between the antennas, horizontally coded spatial multiplexing is diversity suboptimal since each message bit is encoded and transmitted by only one antenna.

An under-sampled receiver can sample the received baseband signals at only a fraction of the Nyquist rate and turns out to be an effective solution to the bottleneck of high-rate sampling and processing in ultra-wideband (UWB) communications. The spectrum aliasing problem can be solved by an analogy between an under-sampled system and a multiple-antenna one. However, underlying differences between the two systems exist and motivate the study of the fundamental limits of a coded under-sampled system. The study is carried out by characterizing the optimal coding structures with and without channel state information at transmitter (CSIT). A practical selective coding structure is also developed to provide satisfactory performance with reduced CSIT requirement. Finally, simulations are conducted to verify the theoretical characterization.

Using this connection we conclude that designing sequences with good properties for samples of timing delay guarantees that the same sequence to be good for all timing delays. Finally using generalized bent function we manage to construct a family of sequences which are good for asynchronous phase encoding OCDMA systems and using these sequences we introduce an M-ary modulation scheme for phase encoding OCDMA","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.262132","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036451.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.262132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","startPage":"2642","endPage":"2646","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spreading Sequences for Asynchronous Spectrally Phase Encoded Optical CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036451","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spreading Sequences for Asynchronous Spectrally Phase Encoded Optical CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036451/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9188106","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4036451/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spreading Sequences for Asynchronous Spectrally Phase Encoded Optical CDMA","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-555.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113298S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036451","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036453,"authors":[{"name":"Xuanlong Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, USA"],"firstName":"Xuanlong","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37561920600"},{"name":"Martin J.

They considered the case of no channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) but perfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR).

An accompanying sudodecoding strategy efficiently recovers x given y. Sudocodes require only M = O(Klog(N)) measurements for exact reconstruction with worst-case computational complexity O(Klog(K) log(N)).

In this paper, we identify and study the above scenario from an information-theoretic viewpoint. We explore the gain provided by collaborating hearing aids as a function of the communication rate.

Jedynak and S. Khudanpur (2005) as an effective, parameter-free technique for estimating a probability mass function (pmf) from sparse data. The MLS contains all pmfs that assign merely a higher likelihood to the observed counts than to any other set of counts, for the same sample size. In this paper, the MLS is extended to the case of conditional pmf estimation. First, it is shown that, when the criterion for selecting a pmf from the MLS is the KL-divergence, the selected conditional pmf naturally has a back-off form, except for a ceiling on the probability of high frequency symbols that are not seen in particular contexts. Second, the pmf has a sparse parameterization, leading to efficient algorithms for KL-divergence minimization. Experimental results from bigram and trigram language modeling indicate that pmfs selected from the MLS are competitive with state-of-the-art estimates","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261575","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261575","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","startPage":"2814","endPage":"2818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Language Modeling with the Maximum Likelihood Set: Complexity Issues and the Back-off Formula","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036486","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Language Modeling with the Maximum Likelihood Set: Complexity Issues and the Back-off Formula","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036486/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9164754","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4036486/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Language Modeling with the Maximum Likelihood Set: Complexity Issues and the Back-off Formula","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-590.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059052S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4036487,"authors":[{"name":"Markus E.

In contrast, space-time/frequency coding for multiple-access channels (MACs) seems largely unexplored. Building on the framework in Gallager, IEEE Trans. IT, 1985 for characterizing the dominant error event regions in single-antenna additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) MACs, we derive rate-dependent space-time/frequency code design criteria for fading multiantenna MACs with perfect channel state information at the receiver. It is demonstrated that, depending on the transmission rate tuple, joint designs taking the presence of multiple users explicitly into account may be necessary. Our results furthermore allow to identify the rate regions where, for each user, employing codes designed for the single-user case is optimal. Finally, we show that the number of receive antennas has a significant impact on the dominant error event regions and hence, plays an important role in the code design criteria. As a byproduct of our analysis, we find that the classical code design criteria (based on pairwise error probabilities) are recovered using a completely different approach aimed at minimizing the probability of encountering a bad effective channel realization","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261576","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036487.pdf","startPage":"2819","endPage":"2823","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiuser Space-Time/Frequency Code Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036487","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-14 July 2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036487/","displayDocTitle":"Multiuser Space-Time/Frequency Code Design","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9176132","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036487/","conferenceDate":"9-14 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiuser Space-Time/Frequency Code Design","confLoc":"Seattle, WA, USA","sourcePdf":"ISIT-00-591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042921S","chronDate":"9-14 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035458","isNumber":"4035896","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035458","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4035896","articleId":"4036487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4036489,"authors":[{"name":"Chadi Abou-Rjeily","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electronics and Information Technology, Atomic Energy Commission, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Chadi","lastName":"Abou-Rjeily","id":"37541911000"},{"name":"Norbert Daniele","affiliation":["Laboratory of Electronics and Information Technology, Atomic Energy Commission, Grenoble, France"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Daniele","id":"37298906500"},{"name":"Jean-claude Belfiore","affiliation":["Communications and Electronics Department, Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-claude","lastName":"Belfiore","id":"37284731700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0505-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0504-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4036489","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":46},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse modulation","Space time codes","Amplitude modulation","Modulation coding","Fading","Algebra","Laboratories","Information technology","Ultra wideband technology","Modular construction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","diversity reception","modulation coding","pulse amplitude modulation","pulse position modulation","space-time codes","transmitting antennas","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space-time codes","position modulated UWB systems","carrier-less ultra-wideband transmissions","pulse position modulation","hybrid pulse amplitude modulation","full diversity","transmit antennas"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036489","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2006.261578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2006.261578","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4035896","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035458/4035896/04036489.pdf","startPage":"2829","endPage":"2833","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Family of Space-Time Codes for Pulse Amplitude and Position Modulated UWB Systems","abstract":"This paper presents the construction of new totally-real space-time coding schemes suited for carrier-less ultra-wideband transmissions.

Using Lagrange duality, we develop an easily computable, tight upper bound on the loss in information rate due to the use of any given input covariance for this channel. This bound is applied to two simple transmission strategies.

Recently, a great number of fast block matching algorithms (BMAs) have been proposed in the literature based on the discovery of the center-biased characteristics of motion-vector distribution. In this paper, a novel oriented adaptive cross search (OACS) algorithm is proposed, where small cross, large cross and T-shape search patterns are defined and utilized adaptively. In accordance with the adaptive tracing of orientation change or optimal point, three kinds of key points are defined to decide which kind or which oriented pattern may be chosen for the next step. Experimental results on the benchmarks have shown that the OACS algorithm can provide average speed ups of 74.65%, 39.78%, 42.44%, and 7.84% over DS, SDS, CDS, and SCDS, respectively.

In recent researches of finding coupling points, Approximate K-D tree search algorithm (AK-D tree) is an efficient nearest neighbor search algorithm with comparable results. We proposed adaptive dual AK-D tree search algorithm (ADAK-D tree) for searching and synthesizing coupling points as significant control points to improve the registration accuracy in ICP registration applications. ADAK-D tree utilizes AK-D tree twice in different geometrical projection orders to reserve true nearest neighbor points used in later ICP stages. An adaptive threshold in ADAK-D tree is used to reserve sufficient coupling points for a smaller alignment error. Experimental results are shown that the registration accuracy of using ADAK-D tree is improved more than the result of using AK-D tree and the computation time is acceptable","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2006.262598","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4036510","startPage":"177","endPage":"180","pdfPath":"/iel5/4036509/4036510/04036565.pdf","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2006.262598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Dual AK-D Tree Search Algorithm for ICP Registration Applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative closest point algorithm","Iterative algorithms","Nearest neighbor searches","Biomedical imaging","Hospitals","Augmented reality","Neurosurgery","Testing","Robustness","Runtime"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","image registration","iterative methods","medical image processing","tree searching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative closest point algorithm","ICP","registration application","medical image","3-D architecture area","approximate K-D tree search algorithm","adaptive dual AK-D","coupling point","geometrical projection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Dual AK-D Tree Search Algorithm for ICP Registration Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036565/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036565/","accessionNumber":"9098402","publicationDate":"July 2006","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Dual AK-D Tree Search Algorithm for ICP Registration Applications","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-55.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042092S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4036509","isNumber":"4036510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4036509","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4036510","articleId":"4036565","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036574,"authors":[{"name":"Nukhet Ozbek","affiliation":["International Computer Institute, Ege University, Bornova, Izmir, Turkey"],"firstName":"Nukhet","lastName":"Ozbek","id":"37565174300"},{"name":"A.

This face detector is based on a feature extraction and classification technique which consists in a pipeline of convolutions and subsampling operations. Design of embedded systems must find a good trade off between performance and code size due to the limited amount of resource available. We propose a methodology to cope with the main drawbacks of the CFF original implementation like floating point computation and memory allocation, to allow parallelism exploitation and perform algorithm optimizations.

This paper presents a new rain removal algorithm that incorporates both temporal and chromatic properties of rain in video. The temporal property states that an image pixel is never always covered by rain throughout the entire video. The chromatic property states that the changes of R, G, and B values of rain-affected pixels are approximately the same. By using both properties, the algorithm can detect and remove rain streaks in both stationary and dynamic scenes taken by stationary cameras. To handle videos taken by moving cameras, the video can be stabilized for rain removal, and destabilized to restore camera motion after rain removal. It can handle both light rain and heavy rain conditions.

In this paper, we develop a new block-based DCT framework in which the first transform may follow a direction other than the vertical or horizontal one, while the second transform is arranged to be a horizontal one. Compared to the conventional DCT, the resulting directional DCT framework is able to provide a better coding performance for image blocks that contain directional edges-a popular scenario in many image signals.

The framework is tolerant to de-synchronizing errors in feature estimates, which have hitherto crippled feature-based embedding methods. The method uses a concatenated coding system comprising of an outer q-ary LDPC code and an inner insertion-deletion code to recover from both de-synchronization caused by feature estimation discrepancies between the transmitter and receiver; and errors in estimated symbols arising from other channel perturbations. We illustrate the framework in a speech watermarking application employing pitch modification for data-embedding. We show that the method indeed allows recovery of watermark data even in the presence of de-synchronization errors in the underlying pitch-based embedding.

The time-varying channel characteristics make it difficult to find the exact relationship between the packet size and the throughput and decide an optimal packet size in advance. Furthermore, every node would suffer different channel conditions. In this paper, we tackle this problem by an optimization approach. A context-aware framework is designed to optimize the packet size adaptively in order to maximize the throughput. In this approach each node abstracts its specific context via the throughput from the time-varying wireless environments. The obtained throughput information is the instantaneous integrated effect of all contexts in wireless LAN environments. This approach adopts neural networks to learn the complex nonlinear function between the packet size and the throughput and adaptively adjusts the packet size.

Through mathematical analysis, it was found that the steady-state weight fluctuation and large values of convergence parameter can lead to an increase of variance of center-gradient, which induces ill-behaving convergence.

It has become a well-known theory that the high-level semantics in sport video can be \"computationally interpreted\" based on the occurrences of specific audio and visual features which can be extracted automatically. State-of-the-art solutions for features-based event classification have only relied on either manual-knowledge based heuristics or machine learning. To bridge the gaps, we have successfully combined the two approaches by using learning-based heuristics. The heuristics are constructed automatically using decision tree while manual supervision is only required to check the features and highlight contained in each training segment. Thus, fully automated construction of classification system for sports video events has been achieved.

This is due to the fact that in most cases, the number of training samples is much smaller than the dimensionality of the sample space. The problem becomes even more severe if only one training sample is available for each subject. In this paper, followed by the well-known unsupervised technique, kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), a novel feature selection scheme is proposed to establish a discriminant feature subspace in which the class separability is maximized. Extensive experiments performed on the FERET database indicate that the proposed scheme significantly boosts the recognition performance of the traditional KPCA solution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Face recognition","Principal component analysis","Spatial databases","Linear discriminant analysis","Supervised learning","Humans","Unsupervised learning","Data mining","Image databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","feature extraction","learning (artificial intelligence)","principal component analysis","visual databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["eigenface selection","face recognition","supervised learning technique","training sample","kernel principal component analysis","KPCA","feature selection scheme","FERET database"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICME.2006.262861","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4036509/4036510/04036930.pdf","startPage":"1637","endPage":"1640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4036510","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2006.262861","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selecting Kernel Eigenfaces for Face Recognition with One Training Sample Per Subject","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Selecting Kernel Eigenfaces for Face Recognition with One Training Sample Per Subject","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036930/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036930/","accessionNumber":"9112715","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selecting Kernel Eigenfaces for Face Recognition with One Training Sample Per Subject","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049276S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4036509","isNumber":"4036510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4036509","xplore-issue":"4036510","articleId":"4036930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4036931,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio Rama","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Rama","id":"38302136500"},{"name":"Francesc Tarres","affiliation":["Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Francesc","lastName":"Tarres","id":"37295286300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0367-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1945-7871"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1945-788X"}],"articleNumber":"4036931","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"abstract":"Recently, 3D face recognition algorithms have outperformed 2D conventional approaches by adding depth data to the problem. However, independently of the nature (2D or 3D) of the approach, the majority of them required the same data format in the test stage than the data used for training the system. This issue represents the main drawback of 3D face research since 3D data should be acquired under highly controlled conditions and in most cases require the collaboration of the subject to be recognized. Thus, in real world applications (control access points or surveillance) this kind of 3D data may not be available during the recognition process. This leads to a new paradigm using some mixed 2D-3D face recognition systems where 3D data is used in the training but either 2D or 3D information can be used in the recognition depending on the scenario. Following this new concept, partial linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) is presented in this paper. Preliminary results have shown an improvement with respect to the partial PCA approach","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","pdfPath":"/iel5/4036509/4036510/04036931.pdf","startPage":"1641","endPage":"1644","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo","doi":"10.1109/ICME.2006.262862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2006.262862","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4036510","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4036931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Partial LDA vs Partial PCA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear discriminant analysis","Principal component analysis","Face recognition","Image recognition","Lighting","System testing","Collaboration","Surveillance","Computational efficiency","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","principal component analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D face recognition algorithm","partial linear discriminant analysis","PLDA","principal component analysis","partial PCA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4036931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-12 July 2006","displayDocTitle":"Partial LDA vs Partial PCA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4036931/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2006","accessionNumber":"9112716","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","conferenceDate":"9-12 July 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Partial LDA vs Partial PCA","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"ICME-00-421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060875S","chronDate":"9-12 July 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4036509","isNumber":"4036510","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4036509","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4036510","articleId":"4036931","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4036950,"authors":[{"name":"P.

However, previous works are poor in the power performance. In this paper, the first low power context-based adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC) scheme named the side information aided (SIA) symbol look ahead (SLA) one-pass CAVLC is proposed, with the non-zero and abs-one SIA flags.

In this paper, a depth image based rendering system is proposed from algorithm level to hardware architecture level. We propose a novel depth image based rendering algorithm with edge-dependent Gaussian filter and interpolation to improve the rendered stereo image quality. Based on our proposed algorithm, a fully-pipelined depth image based rendering hardware accelerator is proposed to support real-time rendering. The proposed hardware accelerator is optimized in three steps. First, we analyze the effect of fixed point operation and choose the optimal wordlength to keep the stereo image quality. Second, a three-parallel edge-dependent Gaussian filter architecture is proposed to solve the critical problem of memory bandwidth. Finally, we optimize the hardware cost by the proposed hardware architecture. Only 1/21 amounts of vertical PEs and 1/11 amounts of horizontal PEs is needed by the proposed folded edge-dependent Gaussian filter architecture. Furthermore, by the proposed check mode, the whole Z-buffer can be eliminated during 3D image warping. In additions, the on-chip SRAMs can be reduced to 66.7 percent compared with direct implementation by global and local disparity separation scheme. A prototype chip can achieve real-time requirement under the operating frequency of 80 MHz for 25 SDTV frames per second (fps) in left and right channel simultaneously.

New innovations often loose momentum due to a lack of resources required to fully explore and develop a concept when such new potential product innovations are not effectively communicated and conceptualized. Hence engagement and effective communication with stakeholders is essential to ensure required resources are maintained. This paper studies how appropriate product concept visioning coupled with multiple scenario building as part of an innovation roadmap can formulate product innovation and provide effective communication with the required stakeholders. Several consumer electronic product concept projects undertaken by a major MNC based in Singapore were analyzed. Critical characteristics of an integrative innovation process were identified and linkages to existing product & technology roadmaps identified. The scope considered is that of convergent innovation where technologies and product features are used in new application areas. Several key roles emerge as necessary to manage such an innovation process. These include concept architect, integration agent and market interface roles and how these can be combined to provide an integrated innovation process. This process is also used to augment and support the product & technology roadmaps of business units who are responsible for product development and commercialization. The paper concludes that innovation requires pushing existing roadmap boundaries using concept visioning and scenario building. These tools are necessary to identify the market context, including varying and emerging markets and build the business case to justify resources for further development. Too far over the roadmap event horizon and the concept vision can be lost and difficult to communicate, however if the concept does not push the existing roadmap boundaries enough it falls into existing product development pipelines which are already time pressured and resource allocated","doi":"10.1109/ICMIT.2006.262290","publicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Management of Innovation and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2006 IEEE International Conference on Management of Innovation and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4035773/4037069/04037088.pdf","startPage":"604","endPage":"607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037069","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICMIT.2006.262290","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4037088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Targeting the Innovation Roadmap Event Horizon: Product Concept Visioning & Scenario Building","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4037088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-23 June 2006","displayDocTitle":"Targeting the Innovation Roadmap Event Horizon: Product Concept Visioning & Scenario Building","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"June 2006","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","htmlLink":"/document/4037088/","conferenceDate":"21-23 June 2006","accessionNumber":"9177280","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Targeting the Innovation Roadmap Event Horizon: Product Concept Visioning & Scenario Building","confLoc":"Singapore","sourcePdf":"ICMIT-2-19.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124628S","chronDate":"21-23 June 2006","xplore-pub-id":"4035773","isNumber":"4037069","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4035773","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4037069","articleId":"4037088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4037171,"authors":[{"name":"Bonggyun Kim","affiliation":["Policy Research Center, Korea Industrial Technology Foundation, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Bonggyun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37831661900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"1-4244-0147-X","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"1-4244-0148-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4037171","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Research and development","Technology planning","Aerospace industry","Military aircraft","Appropriate technology","Air safety","Aerospace safety","Strategic planning","Commercialization","Aerospace testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace industry","aerospace safety","aircraft","innovation management","monopoly","product life cycle management","strategic planning","supply and demand","technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["technology roadmapping","R&D planning coordination","T-501 aircraft","aerospace industry","aircraft system integrator","demand monopoly firms","military","airliners","component supplying firms","aerospace component","safety regulations","value chain structure","cooperative development strategies","aircraft development","planning system","commercialization","strategic forecasts"]}],"abstract":"This study conducted experiments to test how technology division structures are expressed and analyzed on a technology roadmap by identifying the relationships between system integration and components during the development of the T-50\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n aircraft in the aerospace industry. The aerospace industry has the typical features of a complex structure, requiring the integration of several million components and requires a high technology concentration in each assembly phases. Further, the aerospace industry also has unique features that undergo a great value chain variation in accordance with the purchasing power between an aircraft system integrator (final manufacturer) and a few demand monopoly firms (military or airliners). Accordingly, a system integrator shall need an operational plan, which combines an appropriate development of demand firm's needs with existing technology resources, further requiring close cooperation among several component supplying firms. On the other side, an aerospace component has very complex and precise operational procedures that must meet strict safety regulations due to their effects of aircraft safety and reliability. Because of these reasons, system integrators and component suppliers have a strong value chain structure of technology dependence and operations. Thus, reciprocal information sharing and cooperative development strategies between firms form an indispensable operational foundation for aircraft development. That is, it is necessary to have an appropriate planning system to consider both commercialization and vast R&D costs when establishing common development strategies among technology organizations. A technology roadmap is designed around detailed strategic forecasts of technology in the developmental phase, and includes time planning between organizations that, in turn creates new technologies for future development strategies.

However, these echoes often are overlapped due to closely spaced reflectors and/or microstructure scattering. The decomposition of these echoes is a major and challenging problem. Therefore, signal modeling and parameter estimation of the nonstationary ultrasonic echoes is critical for image analysis, target detection, arid object recognition. In this paper, a successive parameter estimation algorithm based on the chirplet transform is presented. The chirplet transform is used not only as a means for time-frequency representation, but also to estimate the echo parameters, including the amplitude, time-of-arrival, center frequency, bandwidth, phase, and chirp rate. Furthermore, noise performance analysis using the Cramer Rao lower bounds demonstrates that the parameter estimator based on the chirplet transform is a minimum variance and unbiased estimator for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as low as 2.5 dB. To demonstrate the superior time-frequency and parameter estimation performance of the chirplet decomposition, ultrasonic flaw echoes embedded in grain scattering, and multiple interfering chirplets emitted by a large, brown bat have been analyzed. It has been shown that the chirplet signal decomposition algorithm performs robustly, yields accurate echo estimation, and results in SNR enhancements.

Previously, we reported three-dimensional (3D) and 2D reconstruction methods utilizing a typical Poisson's ratio very close to 0.5 (nearly incompressible). However, because a decrease in the accuracy of the reconstructed value was confirmed to be due to the difference between the original value and the set value, we proposed 3D and 2D methods of reconstructing Poisson's ratio as well. Furthermore, we proposed methods of reconstructing density and dealing with dynamic deformation. However, due to tissue incompressibility, the reconstructions of shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, and density became unstable. In this report, to obtain stable, unique reconstructions, we describe a new reconstruction method using mean normal stress approximated by the product of one of Lame's constants lambda and volume strain epsiv\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">alphaalpha</sub>\n as an unknown. Regularization is simultaneously applied to the respective distributions to decrease the instability of the reconstructions due to measurement errors of the deformation. This method also enables stable, unique reconstructions of shear modulus and density under the condition that the mean normal stress remains unknown.

The function is approximated by a polyhedron, or its N-dimensional equivalent, and this polyhedral model is generated directly by the circuit. The circuit is formed of two cascaded sections: the first, using resistive networks, generates voltages representing each of the faces of the polyhedron; the second section, using analog diode logic, selects the appropriate voltage as the output. The analog diode logic uses basic circuits similar to those used in digital logic. It is shown that the analog logic can be described by a distributive lattice, closely related to Boolean algebra. Methods of logic synthesis are developed. Circuit design is discussed, and it is shown how the effect on the logic section of the finite source impedance of the resistive networks which feed it can be turned to practical advantage. The specific example of the multiplication of two variables is studied in some detail, providing a basis of comparison with the known techniques such as the quarter-squares and log-antilog methods. Finally, test results on a simple three-variable function generator are given. The method is not incremental in nature, and differs from current techniques in this regard. Thus the setting up of a function on a generator is simplified, owing to the noninteraction between segments. Also, the area of the input space to be covered is adjustable to correspond with the input domain of the function.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1963.263420","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4037797/04037806.pdf","startPage":"112","endPage":"129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1963.263420","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Method of Generating Functions of Several Variables Using Analog Diode Logic","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4037806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1963","displayDocTitle":"A Method of Generating Functions of Several Variables Using Analog Diode Logic","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4037806/","publicationDate":"April 1963","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-12","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1963","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Method of Generating Functions of Several Variables Using Analog Diode Logic","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-12-n2-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040889S","chronDate":"April  1963","isNumber":"4037797","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"27","articleId":"4037806","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4037854,"authors":[{"name":"Leo Hellerman","affiliation":["Development Laboratory, Data Systems Division, IBM, Corporation, Poughkeepsie, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Leo","lastName":"Hellerman","id":"37319895800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0367-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4037854","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":64,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":144},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4037854","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic circuits","Logic functions","Logic design","Circuit synthesis","Costs","Low earth orbit satellites","Art","Design methodology","Relays"]}],"abstract":"This report gives a complete catalog of minimal NOR circuits and minimal NAND circuits, assuming complements not available, for all logic functions of three variables.

The notion of a definite event introduced by Kleene, as well as the related concepts of definite automata and tables, are studied here in detail. Basic results relating to the minimum number of states required for synthesizing an automaton of a given degree of definiteness are proved. We give a characterization of all k-definite events definable by k+1 state automata. Various decision problems pertaining to definite automata are effectively solved. We also solve effectively the problem of synthesizing a minimal automaton defining a given definite event. The solutions of decision and synthesis problems given here are practical in the sense that if the problem is presented by n units of information, then the algorithm in question requires about n3 steps of a very elementary nature (rather than requiring about 2n steps as some algorithms for automata do, which puts them beyond the capacity of the largest computers even for relatively small values of n). A notion of equivalence of definite events is introduced and the uniqueness of the minimal automaton defining an event in an equivalence class is proved.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1963.263534","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1963.263534","startPage":"233","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4037847/04037857.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Theory of Definite Automata","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4037857/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1963","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1963","displayDocTitle":"The Theory of Definite Automata","volume":"EC-12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"June 1963","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Theory of Definite Automata","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-12-n3-10.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038818S","chronDate":"June  1963","isNumber":"4037847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"83","articleId":"4037857","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4037861,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The requirements include absence of pattern sensitivity, controllable input impedance, a wide band pass, stable gain, high common mode rejection, the ability to handle bipolar signals, stable reference levels, a fast comparator, low threshold level, and, one hopes, low cost. This paper discusses a new circuit which fulfills these requirements with simplicity. Intended for large size (> 1000 words) random access core and thin-film memories, it is capable of handling, for example, a 50-mv ``1'' with approximately 50-nsec delay for transmission and comparison. Common mode signals of as high as 10 volts do not affect discriminator performance. Two key features of the circuit are the use of a dc-coupled, ``long-tail pair'' preamplifier and a pair of tunnel diodes as the discrimination elements. The dc-coupled differential preamplifier provides high common mode rejection, stable gain, is pattern insensitive, and has the ability to handle bipolar signals. The tunnel diode provides a superior discriminator, since it is fast, and has a low-level threshold which is controllable and stable with temperature variations. Thus, requirements on the magnitude and stability of the preamplifier gain are less severe. Design equations are derived and a complete dc worst-case analysis is performed. Variations in the circuit for several specific applications and experimentally determined performance data are described. The generalized problem of a tunnel-diode discriminator used with a preamplifier is treated in Appendix II.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4037865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1963","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1963","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"June 1963","volume":"EC-12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A High-Speed Direct-Coupled Magnetic Memory Sense Amplifier Employing Tunnel-Diode Discriminators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Speed Direct-Coupled Magnetic Memory Sense Amplifier Employing Tunnel-Diode Discriminators","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-12-n3-18.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02608S","chronDate":"June  1963","isNumber":"4037847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4037865","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4037912,"authors":[{"name":"George Nagy","affiliation":["Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Nagy","id":"37830998300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0367-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4037912","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4037912","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Analog memory","Concurrent computing","Analog computers","Logic devices","Brain modeling","Computer displays","Laboratories","Logic functions","Computer simulation","Probabilistic logic"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1963.263470","endPage":"393","startPage":"388","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4037902/04037912.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1963.263470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey of Analog Memory Devices","abstract":"Widespread and persistent interest in the implementation of multilevel logic, conditional probability computers, learning machines, and brain models has created a need for an inexpensive analog or quasi-digital storage element.

In the construction, every machine is assumed to have an input terminal, an output terminal and a special starting input terminal. The methods described [1], [2] involve a recursive procedure. For example, if machines M\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</inf>\n and M\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</inf>\n realize the regular expressions E and F respectively, then the machine realizing the concatenation, R = EF, is obtained [1], [2] by connecting the output of M\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">E</inf>\n to the starting terminal of M\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">F</inf>\n. In this paper it is shown that a submachine generated by the algorithm in the middle of the synthesis procedure cannot be replaced in general, by an equivalent machine. It is felt that the proofs of the original algorithms [1], [2] are rather brief and do not point out the difficulties which might arise if proper precautions are not taken. To remedy this situation, this paper examines the construction in detail. The notion of recurrent realization of a regular expression is introduced, and a theorem is proved that the construction is valid if the proper precautions are taken.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Construction of Sequential Machines from Regular Expressions","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1963.263474","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4037902/04037916.pdf","startPage":"402","endPage":"403","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1963.263474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037902","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4037916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4037916/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1963","displayDocTitle":"On the Construction of Sequential Machines from Regular Expressions","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-12","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Aug. 1963","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Construction of Sequential Machines from Regular Expressions","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-12-n4-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036115S","chronDate":"Aug.  1963","isNumber":"4037902","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4037916","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4037956,"authors":[{"name":"P.

For threshold gates in which the logical ``zero'' corresponds to a constant signal of zero value and in which the coefficients are all positive or all negative, these tolerances are functions only of the gap boundaries of the map realized by the component. A set of theorems is presented that define ``algebraic-like'' operations which provide a means for performing a sequence of symbolic operations on the desired logical function whereby the latter is transformed into a description of a network of threshold components which is its realization. Using these theorems a procedure is given for realizing an arbitrary logical function as a network of threshold components with specified sensitivity.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1963.263624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4037952","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4037952/04037956.pdf","endPage":"454","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realization of Logical Functions by a Network of Threshold Components with Specified Sensitivity","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1963.263624","startPage":"443","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4037956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1963","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1963","displayDocTitle":"Realization of Logical Functions by a Network of Threshold Components with Specified Sensitivity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4037956/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 1963","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"EC-12","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realization of Logical Functions by a Network of Threshold Components with Specified Sensitivity","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-12-n5-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034978S","chronDate":"Oct.  1963","isNumber":"4037952","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"15","articleId":"4037956","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4037974,"authors":[{"name":"Amarendra Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Dept. of Elec.

The digital command storage and processing element will permit reprogramming of spacecraft orientation and astronomical experiments on each orbit, even when the satellite is not in contact with the ground, while the core memory element will permit storage of experiment data for subsequent transmission to the ground.

The PAU has been shown to be a processor of fundamentally new design-its logical organization has no analog in the central processing unit of existing computers. The PAU is the first modular parallel processor which because of its digital organization is capable of more reliable visual identification than part analog/part digital preprocessors of much less generality and potential virtuosity; is faster than any presently suggested alternative realizable today at comparable cost; and can serve as a prototype to a new generation of parallel computers that will capitalize upon thin film and integrated semiconductor circuitry of the immediate future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038028/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1963","volume":"EC-12","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 1963","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"The Illinois Pattern Recognition Computer-ILLIAC III","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Illinois Pattern Recognition Computer-ILLIAC III","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-12-n6-22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026125S","chronDate":"Dec.  1963","isNumber":"4038006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"88","articleId":"4038028","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4038031,"authors":[{"name":"T.

From research in the automatic analyzer of speech sound, a monosyllable recognition system was constructed in which the phoneme is used as the basic recognition unit. Recently this system has been developed to accept the conversational speech sound with unlimited vocabulary. The mechanical recognition of conversational speech sound requires two basic operations. One is the segmentation of the continuous speech sound into several discrete intervals (or segments), each of which may be thought to correspond to a phoneme, and the other is the pattern recognition of such segments. For segmentation, by defining two criteria, ``stability'' and ``distance,'' the properties of the time pattern obtained by the analysis of input speech sound may be examined. The principle of the recognition is based on the mechanism of the articulation in our speech organ. Corresponding to this, the machine has the functions called phoneme classification, vowel analysis and consonant analysis. A conversational speech recognition system with the phonetic contextual approach is also applied to the vowel recognition where the time pattern of input speech is matched with the stored standard patterns in which the phonetic contextual effects are taken into consideration. The time pattern which has great variety may be effectively expressed by the new representation of ``sequential pattern'' and ``weighting pattern.''","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038006","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038006/04038031.pdf","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1963.263565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1963.263565","startPage":"835","endPage":"846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Automatic Speech Recognition System for Conversational Sound","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1963","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038031/","displayDocTitle":"The Automatic Speech Recognition System for Conversational Sound","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-12","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 1963","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Automatic Speech Recognition System for Conversational Sound","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-12-n6-25.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075149S","chronDate":"Dec.  1963","isNumber":"4038006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"30","articleId":"4038031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038032,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The first section describes the principle of learning matrices. So-called conditioned connections between the characteristics of an object and the meaning of an object are formed in the learning phase. During the operation of connecting the characteristics of an object with its meaning (EB operation of the knowing phase) upon presenting the object characteristics, the associated most similar meaning is realized in the form of a signal by maximum likelihood decoding. Conversely, in operation from the meaning of an object to its characteristics (BE operation) the associated object characteristics are obtained as signals by parallel reading upon application of an object meaning. According to the characteristic signals processed (binary or analog signals) discrimination must be made between binary and nonbinary learning matrices. In the case of the binary learning matrix the conditioned connections are a statistical measure for the frequency of the coordination of object characteristics and object meaning, in the case of the nonbinary learning matrix they are a measure for an analog value proportional to a characteristic. Both types of matrices allow for the characteristic sets applied during EB operation to be unsystematically disturbed within limits. Moreover, the nonbinary learning matrix is invariant to systematic deviations between presented and learned characteristic sets (invariance to affine transformation, translation and rotated skewness).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038032/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1963","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1963","volume":"EC-12","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 1963","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Learning matrices and their applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning matrices and their applications","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-12-n6-26.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07016S","chronDate":"Dec.  1963","isNumber":"4038006","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"72","articleId":"4038032","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1963","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4038069,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The run measure of a function can be defined in terms of its conventional truth-table representation. The output column of the truth table is an ordered sequence of zeros and ones that are disposed in runs; i.e., groups of like digits, of various lengths. The run measure of the function is simply the number of runs in this output sequence. It is often convenient to consider two functions to be equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by some permutation or complementation of the input variables. In this context, the cost of a function can be taken as the minimum value of the run measure over the equivalence class that contains the function. This paper derives a firm upper bound on the run measure for arbitrary n-variable switching functions when arbitrary permutations and complementations of the input variables are permitted. It is also shown that this bound is attained only in the case of the parity functions and that, hence in this sense, all other functions are less complex.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4038069","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Input variables","Cost function","Upper bound","Application software","Logic arrays","Circuits","Laboratories","Aerospace electronics"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038065/04038069.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1964.263828","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1964.263828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bound on the Run Measure of Switching Functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038069/","displayDocTitle":"A Bound on the Run Measure of Switching Functions","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 1964","volume":"EC-13","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bound on the Run Measure of Switching Functions","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-13-n1-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038043S","chronDate":"Feb.  1964","isNumber":"4038065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4038069","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038070,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Criteria for selecting the moduli, and general techniques for implementing the residue arithmetic operations by simple modifications of conventional circuitry are described. A specific system with a conventional word length of 25 bits and a residue system with moduli 128, 127, 63 and 31 are treated in detail, showing that in comparison to the conventional mode of computation, residue arithmetic addition and subtraction are 3 times faster and multiplication is 12 times faster. As an example of the usefulness of the approach, the problem of solving systems of simultaneous linear equations is considered. It is shown that in obtaining solutions by residue arithmetic, the residue mode computation time approaches one sixth that required in the conventional mode as the equation systems become more complex.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1964.263777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1964.263777","startPage":"93","endPage":"101","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038099/04038105.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038099","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving Digital Computer Performance Using Residue Number Theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1964","displayDocTitle":"Improving Digital Computer Performance Using Residue Number Theory","volume":"EC-13","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"April 1964","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving Digital Computer Performance Using Residue Number Theory","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-13-n2-6.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080808S","chronDate":"April  1964","isNumber":"4038099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"13","articleId":"4038105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4038109,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The first is a syntactic extension, in which the class of expressions interpretable within a language is widened. The second is an extension of the functional domain in which operations not previously performable are added to the language. These extensions may be implemented by completely reprogramming the basic language processor (the compiler or interpreter), but such extensions may often be achieved at far less cost by embedding. The authors give an example of each of these two types of extensions by embedding, adding list-processing facilities to the FORTRAN language, and extending the list processing language LISP to facilitate expression and interpretation of string transformations. As an aid to those unfamiliar with list processing, there is a section which reviews this subject. Included are descriptions and explanations of list structures, the various notations used for lists, the basic processes of list processing, and the different notations (machine language, functional, and prototype) used for expressing processing of lists.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1964.263820","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1964.263820","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038191/04038203.pdf","startPage":"395","endPage":"400","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"List Processing and Extension of Language Facility by Embedding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1964","displayDocTitle":"List Processing and Extension of Language Facility by Embedding","volume":"EC-13","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1964","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1964","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038203/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"List Processing and Extension of Language Facility by Embedding","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-13-n4-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018493S","chronDate":"Aug.  1964","isNumber":"4038191","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4038203","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4038207,"authors":[{"name":"Roy M.

The only restriction placed on these circuits is the fact that they are assumed to be clocked. The internal logic is realized with two-level diode or transistor circuitry, and the methods given here minimize both the number of gates and of gate inputs (diodes) required to realize a given sequential circuit. Methods are first developed for the coding of small fully specified state tables for which only the internal logic is to be minimized. These methods are then successively extended to cover the situations where it is desired to minimize simultaneously both the internal logic and the output logic of a sequential circuit, where the state tables are not fully specified, and where the size of the state tables is arbitrarily large. A method for dealing with the special class of ``counter-like'' state tables is also given. All the procedures presented here are designed to be easily programmable on a digital computer, and several of these methods have been so programmed. Our methods are discussed and compared with other existing procedures.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","startPage":"549","endPage":"562","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1964.263726","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1964.263726","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038239/04038248.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038239","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Coding of Internal States of Sequential Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038248/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1964","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1964","displayDocTitle":"The Coding of Internal States of Sequential Circuits","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Oct. 1964","volume":"EC-13","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Coding of Internal States of Sequential Circuits","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-13-n5-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03613S","chronDate":"Oct.  1964","isNumber":"4038239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"57","articleId":"4038248","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038262,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Basic to this method are two languages, Boolean algebra and a register transfer language. From a Boolean algebra description a digital system can be constructed while the second language can be used in a step by step description of the execution of each instruction. To illustrate, a register transfer language is used to give a description of an adder considered as part of a digital system. This description is then translated into a set of Boolean equations. Next, the automation of this translation by using a syntax-directed compiler is explained. The compiler requires a syntactic description of register transfers. This description is given using a meta-language called Backus normal form. A Backus normal form description of Boolean equations that is used for translating Boolean equations into register transfers is also given; this translation process is called analysis. The feasibility of computer-aided design and analysis is thereby demonstrated. The computer-aided design method described in this paper, besides eliminating drudgery and error, would permit several system designs to be attempted and evaluated; a permanent record of the chosen system would also be available for future modifications, maintenance, and simulation. The analysis programs could be used to check the effect on the system of any changes made in the Boolean equations (or equivalently the logical diagrams) and the effect of any unused operation codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038305/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1964","publicationDate":"Dec. 1964","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","volume":"EC-13","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Computer-Aided Digital System Design and Analysis Using a Register Transfer Language","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-Aided Digital System Design and Analysis Using a Register Transfer Language","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-13-n6-11.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050253S","chronDate":"Dec.  1964","isNumber":"4038294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"21","articleId":"4038305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038306,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The circuits are without special starting units. One method of analysis of a circuit leads to a set of equations whose solutions are regular expressions related to the state diagram of the circuit. In another approach, a set of regular equations, identical in form to the next state equations, is obtained directly from the circuit. By reversing the regular equations and using derivatives, the regular equations are transformed to a form related to the reverse state diagram. The discussion clarifies the relationship among circuits, regular expressions and state diagrams. Moreover, further insight is obtained into the solution of equations with regular expressions as unknowns.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Regular Expressions from Sequential Circuits","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1964.263932","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038294/04038308.pdf","startPage":"741","endPage":"744","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1964.263932","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4038308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038308/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1964","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1964","displayDocTitle":"Regular Expressions from Sequential Circuits","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-13","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 1964","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regular Expressions from Sequential Circuits","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-13-n6-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052933S","chronDate":"Dec.  1964","isNumber":"4038294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"3","articleId":"4038308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1964","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038311,"authors":[{"name":"B.

All threshold functions of n variables are difficult to construct for a general value of n, but it is shown that a large number of them can be constructed recursively from threshold functions of fewer variables. Schemes of such generation and related proper ties are discussed. Threshold functions generated in this way are so numerous that they constitute a constructive proof of a good lower bound on the number of threshold functions. By a similar procedure, we can derive a lower bound on the maximum of minimum weights of a threshold element. In this paper, discussion is limited to self-dual threshold functions, but this does not sacrifice generality, because any threshold function can be derived from a self-dual threshold function by assigning 1 or 0 to a certain variable.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lower Bounds of the Number of Threshold Functions and a Maximum Weight","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1965.263958","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038385/04038392.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1965.263958","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038385","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4038392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038392/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1965","displayDocTitle":"Lower Bounds of the Number of Threshold Functions and a Maximum Weight","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-14","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"April 1965","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lower Bounds of the Number of Threshold Functions and a Maximum Weight","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-14-n2-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065971S","chronDate":"April  1965","isNumber":"4038385","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"24","articleId":"4038392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4038393,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The Chow parameters for each function were calculated, and the final enumeration was ordered lexicographically by these parameters to afford a trivial test-synthesis procedure for n\u22647. The enumeration demonstrated that minimal 1-realizations are still integral for n\u22647; it corroborated Cobham's result that complete monotonicity is equivalent to 1-realizability, and established hyper-2-monotonicity as a useful characterization, for n\u22647.

It is shown that a family of surfaces having d degrees of freedom has a natural separating capacity of 2d pattern vectors, thus extending and unifying results of Winder and others on the pattern-separating capacity of hyperplanes. Applying these ideas to the vertices of a binary n-cube yields bounds on the number of spherically, quadratically, and, in general, nonlinearly separable Boolean functions of n variables. It is shown that the set of all surfaces which separate a dichotomy of an infinite, random, separable set of pattern vectors can be characterized, on the average, by a subset of only 2d extreme pattern vectors. In addition, the problem of generalizing the classifications on a labeled set of pattern points to the classification of a new point is defined, and it is found that the probability of ambiguous generalization is large unless the number of training patterns exceeds the capacity of the set of separating surfaces.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1965.264137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1965.264137","startPage":"326","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038444/04038449.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometrical and Statistical Properties of Systems of Linear Inequalities with Applications in Pattern Recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038449/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1965","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1965","displayDocTitle":"Geometrical and Statistical Properties of Systems of Linear Inequalities with Applications in Pattern Recognition","volume":"EC-14","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"June 1965","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometrical and Statistical Properties of Systems of Linear Inequalities with Applications in Pattern Recognition","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-14-n3-5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030503S","chronDate":"June  1965","isNumber":"4038444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"1130","articleId":"4038449","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-26"},{"_id":4038451,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The problem of coding the output states is studied here. Two algorithms for making the assignments are considered. The first gives those encodings for which the sum of the costs of all the output functions is minimum; the second minimizes the variable dependency of the output functions. In problems where reduced variable dependency is possible it has been found that the second algorithm yields minimum or near-minimum cost networks. Since this algorithm is easily applied it is useful for finding economical networks in situations where a large number of variables are involved since in such cases the first algorithm becomes lengthy. Attention is also directed to the problem of determining the optimum number of output variables to use for an encoding. An upper bound is derived and an example is presented which requires this bound.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","startPage":"343","endPage":"349","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1965.264139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1965.264139","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038444/04038451.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State Assignments in Combinational Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038451/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1965","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1965","displayDocTitle":"State Assignments in Combinational Networks","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"June 1965","volume":"EC-14","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State Assignments in Combinational Networks","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-14-n3-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040546S","chronDate":"June  1965","isNumber":"4038444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4038451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038452,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The selection of the diode breakpoints and the output level at each of them involves essentially the optimization of a straight-line segment approximation to the ideal parabolic output. This optimization has often been discussed and actually carried out in commercial multipliers using the least value of the integral of squared error as the optimization criterion. This and other published criteria, however, focus on smoothing the error, but allow a large per cent error in the region of small input. To smooth the per cent error over the whole range a new criterion of the square root of the integral of per cent error squared was applied. The design was carried out on a computer using a type of dynamic programming search process which allowed easy experimentation with the criterion as well as the easy incorporation of practical design requirements. The resulting design showed a substantially smoother per cent error over the entire range with only a very slight increase in per cent error in the region of higher inputs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038465/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1965","publicationDate":"June 1965","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","volume":"EC-14","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optimum Design of a Diode Squarer by Applying the Criterion of Square Root of the Integral of Per Cent Error Squared","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum Design of a Diode Squarer by Applying the Criterion of Square Root of the Integral of Per Cent Error Squared","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-14-n3-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04597S","chronDate":"June  1965","isNumber":"4038444","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","articleId":"4038465","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038469,"authors":[{"name":"Stephen H.

The accumulator register operates in conjunction with another register called the memory exchange register. The memory exchange register can be added to the accumulator, subtracted from the accumulator, ANDed with, and ORed with the accumulator; the result in each case being placed in the accumulator. The accumulator can also be shifted right or left. The problem of carry propagation during addition is alleviated by carry bridging. The accumulator circuitry has been made simpler by treating the operations to be performed collectively rather than individually, and by careful assignment of input-values to the storage devices.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1965","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1965","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038508/","volume":"EC-14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1965","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design of an Accumulator for a General Purpose Computer","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an Accumulator for a General Purpose Computer","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-14-n4-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025585S","chronDate":"Aug.  1965","isNumber":"4038499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"4","articleId":"4038508","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1965","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038510,"authors":[{"name":"Harold K.

Many circuit elements and configurations can be described by this model. An approach, based on conventional single-threshold threshold elements, is developed for the analysis and synthesis of multithreshold threshold elements. It is shown that the basic properties of such elements are similar to conventional threshold elements, and that k-threshold threshold-element realizability of an arbitrary n-variable Boolean function can be related to conventional threshold-element realizability of a related (n+k-1)-variable Boolean function. Foundations for two basically different methods for the synthesis of a single-element realization of an arbitrary Boolean function are developed, as are procedures for transforming such a realization into both two-level and multilevel loop-free networks of k-threshold threshold elements k\u22651. Every element in the networks has the identical weight vector for the independent variables, which is some-times desirable. The transformation technique is a useful approach to the synthesis of functions by networks of conventional threshold elements. It is proved that if the given function requires a k-threshold threshold element, then at least [k/2+I] conventional threshold elements in a two-level network or [1+log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n k] such elements in a multilevel network are required.

The procedure should prove useful for nets which are too large to be treated by more exact methods [2]. The set of tests so found also appears useful for diagnosing (i.e., locating) faults. The class of faults considered is that which causes connections to be stuck at logical one or logical zero. The nets considered may include AND, OR, NAND, NOR, and NOT gates. The bases of the procedure are the ``path sensitizing'' concept, and reduction of a net to its ``equivalent normal form,'' abbreviated enf. It is shown that if a set of tests can be found which detects an appropriate subset of faults in the enf, this set will detect all faults in the original net. The enf also provides a vehicle for systematically finding the most desirable tests, namely those which each detect many faults in the net. The procedure is illustrated in detail by an example.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1966.264376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1966.264376","startPage":"66","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038655/04038667.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Finding a Nearly Minimal Set of Fault Detection Tests for Combinational Logic Nets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038667/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1966","displayDocTitle":"On Finding a Nearly Minimal Set of Fault Detection Tests for Combinational Logic Nets","volume":"EC-15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Finding a Nearly Minimal Set of Fault Detection Tests for Combinational Logic Nets","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-15-n1-12.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027255S","chronDate":"Feb.  1966","isNumber":"4038655","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"150","articleId":"4038667","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4038669,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Recognition is preceded by establishing an order of search through the groups with a relatively small number of ``group masks.'' The character is then identified by means of the ``individual masks.'' through a threshold criterion.

The device has certain similarities to other proposed devices, but the mode of operation and performance is quite new and makes use of effects which are normally avoided or minimized in usual memory devices. The storage element is a thick-film bias magnet with a coercive force smaller than its self-demagnetizing field and is tightly coupled to a second anisotropic thick film which serves as the sensing or reading device. The array conductors are all external to the coupled structure (i.e., no conductors lie between the films) thereby simplifying fabrication. A modified coincident current technique is used to write the information into the bias film. A stored ``1'' is obtained by setting the bias film and hence the read film into a demagnetized state. A read current applied to the word line will cause rotation of the magnetic moments of the read film toward its hard axis, thus inducing a signal in the sense line. A stored ``0'' is obtained by saturating the bias film, which in turn saturates the read film in its hard direction and thus prevents any signal from being induced in the sense line during reading. The modes of operation and design parameters are presented as well as a number of measurements.

Such an associative memory is presented in this paper. The proposed memory is word-organized, and its basic building blocks are cutpoint cells with various indices. All the bit-memories, word-sequential-control networks, word-match tag-networks, and bit-output networks have identical structures, and the proposed memory system is especially compatible with the manufacture of integrated circuit. The memory can perform the comparison, tag, writing and nondestructive reading processes in the parallel-by-bit form, as well as Lewin's sorting scheme for ordered retrieval. The dematching process is completely automatic. The memory sequential-control ontrol system does not use any ladder structure which is commonly employed in previous associative memory systems; hence the operation speed is largely increased. The stage delays for various operations are given, and may be employed to estimate the speed of the associative memory.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1966.264359","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038808/04038825.pdf","startPage":"522","endPage":"528","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038808","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1966.264359","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4038825","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Cutpoint Cellular Associative Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038825/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1966","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1966","displayDocTitle":"A Cutpoint Cellular Associative Memory","volume":"EC-15","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1966","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Cutpoint Cellular Associative Memory","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-15-n4-17.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073609S","chronDate":"Aug.  1966","isNumber":"4038808","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"8","articleId":"4038825","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038828,"authors":[{"name":"James H.

It is shown that any flow table M, which describes the circuit action of a normal fundamental mode asynchronous sequential circuit, can be realized as a fundamental mode circuit with feedback index [log\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</inf>\nS], where S is the maximum number of stable states in any input column of M. The realization requires no inverters (assuming double rail inputs) and thus can be shown to be a minimum transistor, as well as a minimal feedback index, realization for any transistor-diode circuit realization of M. Nonfundamental mode realizations of normal mode flow tables are also considered, and it is shown that such a realization can be found with only one feedback loop, assuming ideal inertial delays, for any given flow table. However, no ideal inertial delay realization has been discovered which does not contain internal feedback. Finally, minimum feedback realizations of non-normal and nonfundamental mode flow tables are briefly considered.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1966.264562","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038871","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1966.264562","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038871/04038880.pdf","startPage":"740","endPage":"749","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feedback in Asynchronous Sequential Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Feedback in Asynchronous Sequential Circuits","volume":"EC-15","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1966","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038880/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback in Asynchronous Sequential Circuits","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-15-n5-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030844S","chronDate":"Oct.  1966","isNumber":"4038871","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"22","articleId":"4038880","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4038883,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is argued that design optimization depends fundamentally on the statistics of the typical software load presented to the computer system, and also that the investigation requires the aid of a total system model. Statistical techniques for defining software characteristics in such a model are presented. It is shown how these tools can be employed to simulate the changing contents of main memory; and as a further illustration, the simulation of an auxiliary memory is demonstrated.

In data-processing equipments and communication systems, information is often transmitted serially by characters and parallel by bits within a character. That is, there are several channels in parallel. Error correction in the existing multiple channel systems has been restricted to the use of block codes with the block length equal to the number of channels. The use of cyclic codes will allow the length of a code word many times greater than the number of parallel channels. This offers simple mechanization and, at the same time, reduces the redundancy of the system.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1966.264476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1966.264476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038923/04038937.pdf","startPage":"926","endPage":"927","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Some Results of Amplitude Distribution Experiments on Shift Register Generated Pseudo-Random Noise","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1966","displayDocTitle":"Some Results of Amplitude Distribution Experiments on Shift Register Generated Pseudo-Random Noise","volume":"EC-15","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1966","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1966","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038937/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Some Results of Amplitude Distribution Experiments on Shift Register Generated Pseudo-Random Noise","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-15-n6-14.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029272S","chronDate":"Dec.  1966","isNumber":"4038923","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"11","articleId":"4038937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1966","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4038946,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This pattern recognition technique is extremely efficient in handwritten character recognition, which is used for illustration in this paper.

The method used is similar to the Quine-McCluskey algorithm for two-level AND/OR networks. Certain functions realizable by input gates or second-level gates are preselected as candidates for possible use in an optimal network. This is analogous to the preselecting of prime implicants in two-level minimization. A network is then obtained by choosing a least-cost subset of the candidates which is adequate for realizing the function. This selection phase is analogous to the use of a prime implicant table in two-level minimization. In TANT minimization, however, an extension to a prime implicant table known as a CC-table must be used. The algorithm permits hand solution of typical four-and five-variable problems. A computer program has been written to handle more complex cases.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","startPage":"18","endPage":"38","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1967.264603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1967.264603","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4038972/04038980.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4038972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Minimization of TANT Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4038980/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1967","displayDocTitle":"The Minimization of TANT Networks","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Feb. 1967","volume":"EC-16","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Minimization of TANT Networks","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-16-n1-8.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042354S","chronDate":"Feb.  1967","isNumber":"4038972","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"33","articleId":"4038980","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4038994,"authors":[{"name":"Sheldon B.

It is shown that threshold gates can be used as simple and inexpensive processors such as adders and multipliers. In fact, for a random-pulse sequence, any Boolean operation among individual pulses will correspond to an algebraic expression among the variables represented by their respective average pulse-rates. So, any logical gate or network performs an algebraic operation. Considering the possible simplicity of these random-pulse processors, large systems can be built to perform parallel analog computation on large amounts of input data. The conventional analog computer has a topological simulation structure that can be readily carried over to the processing of functions of time and of one, two, or perhaps even three space variables. Facility of gating, inherent to any form of pulse-coding, allows the construction of stored-connection parallel analog computers made to process functions of time and two space variables. This paper considers this technique of random-pulse computation and its potential implications. Problems of realization, application examples, and alternate coding schemes are discussed. Speed, accuracy, and uncertainty dispersion are estimated. A brief comparison is made between random-pulse processors and biological neutrons.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1967","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1967","volume":"EC-16","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"June 1967","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Random-Pulse Machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random-Pulse Machines","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-16-n3-4.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030169S","chronDate":"June  1967","isNumber":"4039060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"42","articleId":"4039064","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4039066,"authors":[{"name":"Hisashi Mine","affiliation":["Department Applied Mathematics and Physics Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hisashi","lastName":"Mine","id":"37331791300"},{"name":"Yoshiaki Koga","affiliation":["Department Applied Mathematics and Physics Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshiaki","lastName":"Koga","id":"37346643300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0367-7508"}],"articleNumber":"4039066","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4039066","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Design methodology","Lighting control","Logic","Circuits","Redundancy","Motor drives","Control systems","Traffic control","Road accidents","Velocity control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Error correction in logical design","fail-safe logical design","logical design","redundancy in logical design","reliable logical networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the authors study ``fail-safe'' properties of logical systems, finding the conditions that the basic logical functions of fail-safe logical systems should satisfy and also identifying the allowable failures for the basic logical function circuits.

The speed and the accuracy of convergence are analyzed, and it is shown that there is an important tradeoff between speed and accuracy of convergence.

The IBM 7090 execution time of a compiled logic simulator can be prohibitive. To minimize running time several programming techniques were utilized, including logic block ordering (to allow single pass simulation), parallel fault simulation, stimulus bypassing, and functional simulation. These techniques are described. Several special forms of simulator output were developed.

Today's computers use integrated circuit components containing at most ten gates per component; however, LSI is introducing hundreds of gates per component and will eventually evolve into thousands of gates per component. To the aerospace planner, this technological breakthrough of LSI means tremendous reductions in cost, size, weight, and power consumption of logic components, together with increased speed and reliability. However, for the aerospace planner to successfully implement aerospace computers with LSI, the computer designers and managers must reorient their methodology and goals. A multitude of new design and cost considerations must be carefully scrutinized, and out of this must come the new techniques that will permit effective incorporation of LSI in aerospace computers. Higher speed, a smaller system, greater reliability, and lower cost stem from the physical structure (more gates per component with no increase in component size) of the LSI component. These inherent features of LSI, together with multiprocessor system organization, point to future aerospace computers with capabilities equal to today's best ground base systems.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1967.264741","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1967.264741","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4039137/04039144.pdf","startPage":"558","endPage":"561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Large Scale Integration on Aerospace Computers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1967","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Large Scale Integration on Aerospace Computers","volume":"EC-16","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1967","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1967","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039144/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Large Scale Integration on Aerospace Computers","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-16-n5-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03226S","chronDate":"Oct.  1967","isNumber":"4039137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"2","articleId":"4039144","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4039145,"authors":[{"name":"Saul Y.

The worst case is when two wires run parallel for a long distance. Past literature has been unsuccessful in explaining crosstalk between parallel wires above a ground plane, because it was assumed that only one signal propagation velocity was involved. This paper proves that a signal introduced at one end of a printed wire above a ground plane in the presence of a second parallel (passive) wire must break up into two signals traveling at different velocities. The serious crosstalk implications are examined. The new terms slow crosstalk (SX), fast crosstalk (FX) and differential crosstalk (DX) are defined.","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1967.264721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4039185/04039192.pdf","startPage":"743","endPage":"763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039185","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1967.264721","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Crosstalk (Noise) in Digital Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4039192","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1967","displayDocTitle":"Crosstalk (Noise) in Digital Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039192/","publicationDate":"Dec. 1967","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"EC-16","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1967","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Crosstalk (Noise) in Digital Systems","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-16-n6-7.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024947S","chronDate":"Dec.  1967","isNumber":"4039185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"68","articleId":"4039192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4039197,"authors":[{"name":"Donald L.

For reasons of operational stability it is desirable to keep this number low. The price of such constraint is a degradation in code density. The class of serial recording which includes the well-known frequency modulation and phase encoding represents one extreme where every other symbol is mandatory, making the code density one bit for every two symbols. This paper describes a coding method which improves code efficiency while maintaining the constraint on the length of zero strings. It will be shown that adaptive coding, which is an extension of the block code concept known from information theory, offers a significant improvement. The concept is illustrated by describing a practical application in which the code density is improved from two symbols per bit to three symbols per bit pair, while keeping the maximum length of zero strings to one. It is shown that while this technique represents an improvement by one third over phase encoding, it approaches the theoretical limit for this class of codes to within 4 percent.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive coding","Magnetic recording","Encoding","Transmitters","Timing","Tellurium","Stability","Frequency modulation","Constraint theory","Block codes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive coding","magnetic recording","mass storage","self-clocking","serial recording"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4039206","doi":"10.1109/PGEC.1967.264753","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4037753/4039185/04039206.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PGEC.1967.264753","startPage":"866","endPage":"868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Coding for Self-Clocking Recording","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Coding for Self-Clocking Recording","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039206/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1967","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1967","volume":"EC-16","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Dec. 1967","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Coding for Self-Clocking Recording","sourcePdf":"T-ELCOMP-vEC-16-n6-21.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019214S","chronDate":"Dec.  1967","isNumber":"4039185","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4037753","citationCount":"18","articleId":"4039206","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1967","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4039283,"authors":[{"name":"Jeff Z.

Furthermore, the bidirectional one-to-one mapping between RDFS(FA) axioms in strata 0-2 and OWL DL axioms has been established, which enables RDFS(FA)-agents and OWL DL-agents to communicate with each other more easily.

The objective of reducing broadcast redundancy while still providing high delivery ratio under high transmission error rate is a major challenge in MANETs. In this paper, we propose a simple broadcast algorithm, called double-covered broadcast (DCB), which takes advantage of broadcast redundancy to improve the delivery ratio in an environment that has rather high transmission error rate. Among the 1-hop neighbors of the sender, only selected forwarding nodes retransmit the broadcast message. Forwarding nodes are selected in such a way that 1) the sender's 2-hop neighbors are covered and 2) the sender's 1-hop neighbors are either forwarding nodes or nonforwarding nodes covered by at least two forwarding neighbors. The retransmissions of the forwarding nodes are received by the sender as the confirmation of their reception of the packet. The nonforwarding 1-hop neighbors of the sender do not acknowledge the reception of the broadcast. If the sender does not detect all its forwarding nodes' retransmissions, it resends the packet until the maximum number of retries is reached.

Existing approaches that relieve congestion by balancing the traffic load are encumbered by the modifications that are required to both access points and clients. We propose cell breathing, a well-known concept in cellular telephony, as a load balancing mechanism to handle client congestion in a wireless LAN. We develop power management algorithms for controlling the coverage of access points to handle dynamic changes in client workloads. We further incorporate hand-off costs and manufacturer specified power level constraints into our algorithms. Our approach does not require modification to clients or to the standard. It only changes the transmission power of beacon packets and does not change the transmission power of data packets to avoid the interactions with auto-rating. We analyze the worst-case bounds of the algorithms and show that they are either optimal or close to optimal. In addition, we evaluate our algorithms empirically using synthetic and real wireless LAN traces.

The power constrained discrete rate allocation (PC-DRA) problem that finds the rates at which the base station must transmit to each user is very difficult because of the nonlinear nature of the objective function, the discrete nature of available rates, and the complex relationship between data rate, the target SINR, and the total power constraint. We prove that the PC-DRA problem is NP-complete for CDMA data networks and then propose three heuristics - a two step selective rate reduction (SRR) scheme, a genetic algorithm (GA), and an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) to solve it. We show that all three heuristics can achieve suboptimal that is very close to the global optimal, while SRR provides solutions of high quality with much less computation time than GA and IGA. At the frame level, the rate allocation maximizes the service provider's revenue by adjusting individual user's data rate on a frame by frame basis. On the other hand, the service provider's revenue varies with the system load, which is decided by admission control at the session level. Thus, the admission control needs to maintain an optimal system load. An efficient resource management framework is provided by the cross level (layer) interaction between the link layer (rate control) and the network layer (admission control) in the sense that 1) they share the same objective of maximizing the service provider's revenue, and 2) the solution to the rate allocation problem provides critical information for the admission control decision. The proposed framework is evaluated by extensive simulation experiments with realistic Web browsing and FTP traffic models. Simulation results confirm that the framework is able to provide class-based differentiated data services that also maximize the service provider's revenue","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4039299/04039305.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"191","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2007.29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2007.29","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039299","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4039305","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate Allocation and Admission Control for Differentiated Services in CDMA Data Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Admission control","Multiaccess communication","Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Quality of service","Wireless LAN","Genetic algorithms","Wireless networks","Computer Society","Base stations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","computational complexity","data communication","DiffServ networks","genetic algorithms","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["admission control","CDMA data networks","service provider revenue","user churn behavior","power constrained discrete rate allocation problem","objective function","data rate","SINR","total power constraint","NP-complete problem","step selective rate reduction scheme","improved genetic algorithm","optimal system load","resource management framework","cross level interaction","rate control","realistic Web browsing","FTP traffic models","class-based differentiated data services"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wireless data networks","rate allocation","admission control","differentiated services","user churn."]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039305/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Rate Allocation and Admission Control for Differentiated Services in CDMA Data Networks","volume":"6","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4039305/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9271829","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate Allocation and Admission Control for Differentiated Services in CDMA Data Networks","sourcePdf":"h0179.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131803S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4039299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4039299","articleId":"4039305","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4039308,"authors":[{"name":"Dusit Niyato","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/4039299/4039308/4039308-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dusit Niyato received the BS degree in computer engineering from King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang (KMITL), Thailand, in 1999 and the MSc degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Manitoba, Canada, in 2005.

While the solar radiation process (and, hence, the energy generation process in a solar cell) is modeled by a stochastic process (i.e., a Markov chain), a linear battery model with relaxation effect is used to model the battery capacity recovery process. Developed based on a multidimensional discrete-time Markov chain, the presented model is used to analyze the performances of different sleep and wakeup strategies in a sensor/mesh node. The packet dropping and packet blocking probabilities at a node are the major performance metrics. The numerical results obtained from the analytical model are validated by extensive simulations. In addition, using the queuing model, based on a game-theoretic formulation, we demonstrate how to obtain the optimal parameters for a particular sleep and wakeup strategy. In this case, we formulate a bargaining game by exploiting the trade-off between packet blocking and packet dropping probabilities due to the sleep and wakeup dynamics in a sensor/mesh node. The Nash solution is obtained for the equilibrium point of sleep and wakeup probabilities. The presented queuing model, along with the game-theoretic formulation, would be useful for the design and optimization of energy-efficient protocols for solar-powered wireless sensor/mesh networks under quality-of-service (QoS) constraints","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2007.30","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4039299/04039308.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"236","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2007.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sleep and Wakeup Strategies in Solar-Powered Wireless Sensor/Mesh Networks: Performance Analysis and Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039308/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2007","displayDocTitle":"Sleep and Wakeup Strategies in Solar-Powered Wireless Sensor/Mesh Networks: Performance Analysis and Optimization","volume":"6","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2007","accessionNumber":"9271832","htmlLink":"/document/4039308/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sleep and Wakeup Strategies in Solar-Powered Wireless Sensor/Mesh Networks: Performance Analysis and Optimization","sourcePdf":"h0221.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108361S","chronDate":"Feb.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4039299","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"163","xplore-issue":"4039299","articleId":"4039308","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4039322,"authors":[{"name":"Maki K.

This paper describes the development of intelligent fiber-grating (FG)-based 3-D vision sensory system that enables real-time object detection, monitoring, and tracking. This system uses the richness and the strength of the vision while reducing the data load and computational cost by encoding the working space using a limited number of spatially interrelated 2-D laser spots. The sensor system generates the laser spots by projecting a coherent laser beam on two perpendicularly overlaid layers of FGs. The presence of a target within the visible operational view of the sensor disturbs the part of the projected laser spots' pattern where the target appeared. By calculating the displacement of the disturbed spots within the CCD image plane, the sensor system can detect, in a short time, an object/human and provide relevant information in terms of range, approximate shape, and position.

Therefore, it can avoid the problems of the stability and the misadjustment, which arise from the conventional steepest-descent approaches for the constant-modulus or cumulant optimization.

This means that a PWL controller can be precomputed using parametric programming, and the exact explicit MPC implementation amounts to the evaluation of a PWL function in the control unit. It has recently been shown that PWL function evaluation can be accelerated by searching a binary tree data structure, leading to highly efficient, accurate, and verifiable software implementation in low-cost embedded control units. In this work, we report hardware synthesis results for this type of PWL control, and show that explicit MPC solutions can be implemented in an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with about 20 000 gates, leading to computation times in the microsecond scale. This opens the way for the use of highly advanced control designs such as constrained MPC in small-scale industrial and consumer electronics application areas that are characterized by fast sampling or low cost, including mechatronics, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), automotive control, power electronics, and acoustics.

In particular, a dual-rate system with a fast control updating rate and a slow output sampling rate is considered, which is not uncommon in practice. A lifted model is used to analyze the multirate system in a state-space framework and the lifting technique is applied to derive a subspace equation for multirate systems. From the subspace equation, the multirate MVC law and the algorithm are developed to estimate the multirate MVC-benchmark variance or performance index. The multirate optimal controller is calculated from a set of input/output (I/O) open-loop experimental data and, thus, this approach is data-driven since it does not involve an explicit model. In parallel, the presented MVC-benchmark estimation algorithm requires a set of open-loop experimental data and close-loop routine operating data. No explicit models, namely, transfer function matrices, Markov parameters, or interactor matrices, are needed. This is in contrast to traditional control performance assessment algorithms.

The FFIS uses a global position system (GPS) receiver and an inertial navigation sensor (INS) instrumentation package on each aircraft combined with a wireless communication system for sharing measurements between vehicles. An extended Kalman filter structure blends the outputs of each GPS/INS in a distributed manner so as to maximize the accuracy of the relative state estimates. Differential carrier phase GPS measurements are used to provide high accuracy relative range measurements to the filtering algorithm. A multiple hypothesis Wald test for estimating the integer ambiguity between the two moving vehicles was developed as part of this project. The FFIS was tested in a hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HIL Sim) before being tested in actual F-18 flight tests. Test results validated the FFIS performance. Flight test results showed that the Wald test accurately estimates the integer ambiguity and that relative range estimates using least squares provide accurate position estimates with a mean of approximately 7 cm and a standard deviation of 13 cm","doi":"10.1109/TCST.2006.883241","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/87/4039332/04039353.pdf","startPage":"75","endPage":"85","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCST.2006.883241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Instrumentation System Applied to Formation Flight","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"An Instrumentation System Applied to Formation Flight","volume":"15","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9262013","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4039353/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039353/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Instrumentation System Applied to Formation Flight","sourcePdf":"15tcst01-williamson.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087268S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"87","isNumber":"4039332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"4039332","articleId":"4039353","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4039357,"authors":[{"name":"Argyrios C.

A switched mean-absolute-difference (MAD) prediction scheme is introduced to enhance the traditional temporal MAD prediction model, which is not suitable for predicting abrupt MAD fluctuations. Our new model could reduce the MAD prediction error by up to 69%. Furthermore, an accurate linear rate-quantization (R-Q) model is also formulated to describe the relationship between the total amount of bits for both texture and nontexture information and the quantization parameter (QP), so that the negative effect caused by the inaccurate estimation of nontexture bits is removed. By exploring the relationship between peak signal-to-noise ratio and QP value, the proposed linear R-Q model could further optimize QP calculation at the macroblock level. When compared with the rate control scheme JVT-G012 which is adopted by the latest JVT H.264/AVC reference model JM9.8, the proposed rate control algorithm could reduce the mismatch between actual bits and target ones by up to 75%. To meet the low delay requirement, the buffer is better controlled to prevent overflowing and underflowing. The average luminance PSNR of reconstructed video is increased by up to 1.13 dB at low bit rates, and the subjective video quality is also improved","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039373/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","volume":"17","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"9261285","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4039373/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Rate Control Scheme for Low Delay Video Communication of H.264/AVC Standard","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Rate Control Scheme for Low Delay Video Communication of H.264/AVC Standard","sourcePdf":"17tcsvt01-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077054S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"4039358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"4039358","articleId":"4039373","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4039385,"authors":[{"name":"C.

High costs and reliability concerns have restricted their use in these applications. The concept of distributed FACTS (D-FACTS) is introduced as a way to remove these barriers. A new device, the distributed static series compensator (DSSC), attaches directly to existing HV or EHV conductors and so does not require HV insulation.

Moreover, a comprehensive control strategy is introduced to extract the compensating signals for the control of series and shunt converters of the unified power-quality conditioner (UPQC). The basic approach used in this algorithm is to extract the fundamental component of load current and source voltage by using wavelet-transform decomposition. Then, the amplitude, phase angle, and frequency of fundamental component are calculated using the well-known LS algorithm, which is relatively simple and fast. The voltage and current references of UPQC active power filters are obtained using the positive sequence of three-phase system voltages and load currents. The proposed control strategy can extract the reference currents and voltages of UPQC fast and accurately in the presence of harmonics and/or frequency oscillation.

The converter utilizes resonant turn off and forced commutation with auxiliary thyristors to aid commutation in the converter switches. The PSCAD/EMTDC simulation confirms that the HVDC inverter is capable of operating with a wide range of firing angles, including operation with reactive power export. Further simulation proves that the system is immune to commutation failure even in the case of most severe close single-phase faults. The harmonic generation is comparable to the conventional converter and also the thyristor voltage stress is not significantly increased.

One or multiple parent simulations, in which the unknown voltages are calculated using nodal analysis, launch multiple child simulations concerned with diakoptic subdivisions of the system under study. The interfaces for information exchange between parent and child levels are designed to provide encapsulation. This makes the subdivisions appearing from outside in the form of network branches compatible with the nodal analysis approach. It also facilitates the use of diverse solution methods for different child simulations, as it is shown for the simultaneous solution of equations formulated with nodal analysis and state space methods. Computational efficiency is obtained through the coordinated application of sparse-matrix methods, piecewise linear approximation of nonlinear characteristics, and precalculation of operations pertaining to recurring power-electronic switch statuses. The resulting overall solution process is simultaneous, distributed, and suitable for real-time simulation.

The generation of the switching patterns under SHE-PWM control for each power device is described taking into account the natural balancing of the FC voltages. A new and simple control method for balancing the FC voltages when using SHE-PWM is proposed which is based on the small change of the firing angle according to the polarity of the load current. The FC voltage ripple under SHE-PWM control is estimated and compared to that under PS-SPWM. A method to implement the proposed hybrid PWM with capacitor voltage balancing is also provided.

These analyses require repetitive circuit simulations to account for the randomness in parameter values caused by manufacturing and environmental changes. An accurate modeling technique is also essential for capturing the nonlinear relationships between channel parameters and performance. In this paper, the application of artificial neural networks to accurately capture the nonlinear mappings between parameters and performance to speed up the analysis of high-speed interconnect systems is described. An efficient set of data that uses a few simulations or experiments based on orthogonal arrays is proposed to train the neural network. The neural network can then serve to accurately and efficiently generate performance distributions. The usefulness and accuracy of the proposed approach is verified using an extreme data rate memory system that operates at a data rate of 3.2 Gb/s.

The floorplanner takes a microarchitectural netlist and determines the dimension as well as the placement of the functional modules into single- or multiple-device layers while simultaneously achieving high performance and thermal reliability. The traditional design objectives such as area and wirelength are also considered. The 3-D floorplanning algorithm considers the following 3-D-specific issues: vertical overlap optimization and bonding-aware layer partitioning. The hybrid floorplanning approach combines linear programming and simulated annealing, which is shown to be very effective in obtaining high-quality solutions in a short runtime under multiobjective goals.

Two primary contributions are made. First, an experimental framework in which the viability of \"predictive\" or \"probabilistic\" models of routing congestion for optimization during detailed placement can be evaluated is developed. The main criterion of consideration in these experiments is how (un)reliably various models from the literature detect routing hot spots. It was concluded that such models appear to be too unreliable for detailed placement optimization. Second, motivated by the first result, a single combinatorial framework in which cell placement and \"exact\" routing structures are captured and optimized is presented; the framework relies on the \"trunk decomposition\" of global routing structures, and optimization is performed by generalization of the \"optimal interleaving\" algorithm. An implementation of this framework is studied in the field-programmable gate array domain. The technique can reduce the number of channels at maximum density by more than 60% on average with maximum reduction of more than 81% for optimized global routing taking only 75% of the Versatile Place and Route (VPR) placement and routing runtime combined. For the standard cell domain, routing-based interleaving, on average, reduces the maximum track count by more than two tracks with a maximum reduction of nine tracks","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2006.883918","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4039497/04039507.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2006.883918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039497","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","startPage":"127","endPage":"141","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"RBI: Simultaneous Placement and Routing Optimization Technique","volume":"26","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4039507/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"9254931","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RBI: Simultaneous Placement and Routing Optimization Technique","sourcePdf":"26tcad01-jariwala.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117097S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4039497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4039497","articleId":"4039507","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4039509,"authors":[{"name":"Kyosun Kim","affiliation":["University of Incheon, Incheon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Kyosun","lastName":"Kim","id":"37350887100"},{"name":"Kaijie Wu","affiliation":["University of Illinois, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Kaijie","lastName":"Wu","id":"37278661800"},{"name":"Ramesh Karri","affiliation":["Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA"],"firstName":"Ramesh","lastName":"Karri","id":"37269471300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0278-0070"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4151"}],"articleNumber":"4039509","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":149,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":805},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Council on Electronic Design Automation","url":"http://www.c-eda.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4039509","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum cellular automata","Robustness","Polarization","Clocks","Wire","Switches","Electrons","Energy consumption","Quantum dots","Pulse inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","cellular automata","clocks","low-power electronics","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust QCA adder designs","composable QCA building blocks","quantum-dot cellular automata","ultralow power consumption","adders","clocked cellular automata","majority gates","sneak noise"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Clocked quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA)","crossover","majority gates","sneak noise"]}],"abstract":"Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is attracting a lot of attention due to its extremely small feature size and ultralow power consumption.

Nonlinear response surface models (e.g., quadratic polynomials) can be utilized to capture larger scale process variations; however, such models result in nonnormal distributions for circuit performance. These performance distributions are difficult to capture efficiently since the distribution model is unknown. In this paper, an asymptotic-probability-extraction (APEX) method for estimating the unknown random distribution when using a nonlinear response surface modeling is proposed. The APEX begins by efficiently computing the high-order moments of the unknown distribution and then applies moment matching to approximate the characteristic function of the random distribution by an efficient rational function. It is proven that such a moment-matching approach is asymptotically convergent when applied to quadratic response surface models.

To address these challenges, thermal analysis must be embedded within IC synthesis. However, this requires accurate three-dimensional chip-package heat flow analysis. This has typically been based on numerical methods that are too computationally intensive for numerous repeated applications during synthesis or design. Thermal analysis techniques must be both accurate and fast for use in IC synthesis. This paper presents a novel accurate incremental spatially and temporally adaptive chip-package thermal analysis technique called ISAC for use in IC synthesis and design. It is common for IC temperature variation to strongly depend on position and time. ISAC dynamically adapts spatial- and temporal-modeling granularities to achieve high efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Both steady-state and dynamic thermal analyses are accelerated by the proposed heterogeneous spatial-resolution adaptation and asynchronous thermal-element time-marching techniques. Each technique enables orders-of-magnitude improvement in performance while preserving accuracy when compared with other state-of-the-art adaptive steady-state and dynamic IC thermal analysis techniques. Experimental results indicate that these improvements are sufficient to make accurate dynamic and steady-state thermal analysis practical within the inner loops of IC synthesis algorithms. ISAC has been validated against reliable commercial thermal analysis tools using industrial and academic synthesis test cases and chip designs. It has been implemented as a software package suitable for integration in IC synthesis and design flows and has been publicly released","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2006.882589","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/43/4039497/04039519.pdf","startPage":"86","endPage":"99","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2006.882589","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ISAC: Integrated Space-and-Time-Adaptive Chip-Package Thermal Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4039519","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039519/","displayDocTitle":"ISAC: Integrated Space-and-Time-Adaptive Chip-Package Thermal Analysis","volume":"26","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9254928","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4039519/","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ISAC: Integrated Space-and-Time-Adaptive Chip-Package Thermal Analysis","sourcePdf":"26tcad01-yyang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09012S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"4039497","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"4039497","articleId":"4039519","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4039534,"authors":[{"name":"Meindert Niemeijer","affiliation":["Image Sciences Institute, Utrecht, Netherlands"],"firstName":"Meindert","lastName":"Niemeijer","id":"37418440200"},{"name":"Michael D.

These structures are found by fitting a single point-distribution-model to the image, that contains points on each structure. The method can handle optic disc and macula centered images of both the left and the right eye. The system uses a cost function, which is based on a combination of both global and local cues, to find the correct position of the model points. The global terms in the cost function are based on the orientation and width of the vascular pattern in the image. The local term is derived from the image structure around the points of the model. To optimize the fit of the point-distribution-model to an image, a sophisticated combination of optimization processes is proposed which combines optimization in the parameter space of the model and in the image space, where points are moved directly. Experimental results are presented demonstrating that our specific choices for the cost function components and optimization scheme are needed to obtain good results. The system was developed and trained on a set of 500 screening images, and tested on a completely independent set of 500 screening images. In addition to this the system was also tested on a separate set of 100 pathological images. In the screening set it was able to find the vascular arch in 93.2%, the macula in 94.4%, the optic disc location in 98.4% and whether it is dealing with a left or right eye in 100% of all tested cases.

The circuit employs an innovative architecture which divides the pi/4 rotation operation required in the quadrature synthesizer/mixers, in three rotations. The first two rotations are implemented by using a CORDIC datapath completely realized in carry-save arithmetic. The directions of the CORDIC rotations are computed in parallel by using a little lookup table, for the first rotation, and a multiply by constant and addition circuit for the second rotation. The final (third) rotation is multiplier-based, in order to reduce the circuit latency and increase the circuit performances. The CORDIC datapath is implemented with a novel approach both at the algorithmic level and at the transistor level. At the algorithmic level the combined employ of sign-extension prevention, overflow prevention and a novel rounding scheme are presented. At the transistor level a design style that jointly uses full-CMOS and DPL to improve the circuit latency is described. The overall circuit performances are very interesting. The synthesizer/mixer IC, realized in a 0.25 mum CMOS technology, has an area occupation of 0.22 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and dissipates 152 mW at 380 MHz with a supply voltage of 2.5 V","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2006.886527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel5/4/4039574/04039580.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"160","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2006.886527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 380 MHz Direct Digital Synthesizer/Mixer With Hybrid CORDIC Architecture in 0.25 - CMOS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"A 380 MHz Direct Digital Synthesizer/Mixer With Hybrid CORDIC Architecture in 0.25 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex></formula> CMOS","volume":"42","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","accessionNumber":"9257588","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4039580/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039580/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 380 MHz Direct Digital Synthesizer/Mixer With Hybrid CORDIC Architecture in 0.25 <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex></formula> CMOS","sourcePdf":"42jssc01-decaro.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120005S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4039574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4039574","articleId":"4039580","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4039583,"authors":[{"name":"Hiroki Fujisawa","affiliation":["Technology and Development Office, Elpida Memory, Inc., Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4039574/4039583/4039583-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hiroki Fujisawa (M'00) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronic engineering and the M.S. degree in information and processing from the Tokyo Institute of Technology, Tokyo, Japan, in 1992 and 1994, respectively.","In 1994, he joined the Device Development Center, Hitachi Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.

In a first step this method utilizes infrared (IR) thermal imaging, while the processor is effectively cooled using an IR-transparent heat sink. In the second step the underlying power distribution is derived by determining the temperature fields for each individual power source on the chip. The measured chip temperature distribution is represented as a superposition of these temperature fields. The SIMP data reveals significant temporal and spatial variations of the microprocessor power/temperature distribution, which can be attributed to the circuit layout as well as to the varying utilization levels across the processor while running full workloads. In this paper we have applied the SIMP method to the dual core PowerPCtrade970MP microprocessor to measure detailed temperature and power distributions under full operating conditions. In the first part of the paper the impact of power and temperature limitations of high performance CMOS chips is discussed in detail, where we distinguish between hotspot-limited (or temperature-limited) and power-limited chips. The discussion shows the importance of temperature and power distributions for chip floor planning, layout, design and architecture.

As neuroprosthetic devices transition from experimental to clinical use, there is a need for fully-implantable amplification and telemetry electronics in close proximity to the recording sites. To address these needs, we developed a prototype integrated circuit for wireless neural recording from a 100-channel microelectrode array. The design of both the system-level architecture and the individual circuits were driven by severe power constraints for small implantable devices; chronically heating tissue by only a few degrees Celsius leads to cell death. Due to the high data rate produced by 100 neural signals, the system must perform data reduction as well. We use a combination of a low-power ADC and an array of \"spike detectors\" to reduce the transmitted data rate while preserving critical information. The complete system receives power and commands (at 6.5 kb/s) wirelessly over a 2.64-MHz inductive link and transmits neural data back at a data rate of 330 kb/s using a fully-integrated 433-MHz FSK transmitter.

In order for the LLC not to limit the minimum voltage at which a processor core can run, a dual-VCC 256-Kb SRAM building block is proposed. A fixed high-voltage supply powers the cache which allows the use of the smallest SRAM cell for maximum density, while a separate variable supply is used by the core for ultra-low-voltage operation using dynamic voltage and frequency (DVF). Implemented in a 65-nm bulk CMOS process, the block features low overhead embedded level shifters and an actively clamped sleep transistor for maximum cache leakage power reduction during standby.

The resulting FeRAM-based tag has a nominally identical communication range for both read and write operations, which is indispensable for data write applications. The evaluated tag communication range with a folded dipole antenna is from 0 m to 4.3 m, at the 953-MHz carrier frequency with 4-W transmitting Effective Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) from a reader/writer. The developed tag IC features two circuit blocks to maximize the communication range in 0.35-mum CMOS/FeRAM technology. First is a CMOS-only full-wave rectifier, which can improve the measured efficiency by up to 36.6% by reducing the input parasitic capacitances and optimization of multiplier structure. This efficiency is more than twice that of previously-published results. Second is a low-voltage current-mode ASK demodulator to accommodate a low-breakdown voltage of FeRAM, which converts the ASK power modulation into a linearly modulated current over an incoming power range of 27 dB, corresponding to the entire communication range. The developed demodulator can thus resolve the primary design tradeoff issue between device protection and detection sensitivity in the conventional voltage-mode demodulator","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039597/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","volume":"42","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9257583","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","htmlLink":"/document/4039597/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Passive UHF RF Identification CMOS Tag IC Using Ferroelectric RAM in 0.35-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> Technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Passive UHF RF Identification CMOS Tag IC Using Ferroelectric RAM in 0.35-<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$\\mu{\\hbox {m}}$</tex> </formula> Technology","sourcePdf":"42jssc01-nakamoto.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086761S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"4039574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"213","xplore-issue":"4039574","articleId":"4039597","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4039601,"authors":[{"name":"Stefan Rusu","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Santa Clara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/4039574/4039601/4039601-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Stefan Rusu (M'85\u2013SM'01\u2013F'07) received the M.S.E.E. degree from the Polytechnic Institute, Bucharest, Romania.","He first joined Intel Corporation in 1984 working on data communications integrated circuits.

In a fully integrated test chip implemented using a 0.13-mum bulk silicon process and on-chip inductors, chains of Boost Logic gates operate at clock frequencies up to 1.3 GHz with a 1.5-V supply.

Some circuit technologies are presented to enhance the speed and the lifetime for the Braille sheet display. An OFET SRAM is developed to hide the slow transition of the actuators. Developed five-transistor SRAM cell reduces the number of the bit lines by one-half and reduces the SRAM cell area by 20%. Pipelining the write-operation reduced the SRAM write-time by 69%. Threshold voltage control technology using a back gate increased the static noise margin of SRAM and compensated for the chemical degradation of the OFETs after 15 days. The oscillation frequency tuning range from -82% to +13% in a five-stage ring oscillator is also demonstrated with the threshold voltage control technology. The overdrive techniques for the driver OFETs reduced the transition time of the actuator from 34 s to 2 s.

This framework, which is based on the representation of the CVA in polar coordinates, aims at: 1) introducing a set of formal definitions in the polar domain (which are linked to the properties of the data) for a better general description (and thus understanding) of the information present in spectral change vectors; 2) analyzing from a theoretical point of view the distributions of changed and unchanged pixels in the polar domain (also according to possible simplifying assumptions); 3) driving the implementation of proper preprocessing procedures to be applied to multitemporal images on the basis of the results of the theoretical study on the distributions; and 4) defining a solid background for the development of advanced and accurate automatic change-detection algorithms in the polar domain. The findings derived from the theoretical analysis on the statistical models of classes have been validated on real multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing images according to both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results obtained confirm the interest of the proposed framework and the validity of the related theoretical analysis","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4039606/04039609.pdf","startPage":"218","endPage":"236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.885408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.885408","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039606","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4039609","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Theoretical Framework for Unsupervised Change Detection Based on Change Vector Analysis in the Polar Domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Information analysis","Remote sensing","Solids","Algorithm design and analysis","Change detection algorithms","Satellites","Image sensors","Pixel","Multispectral imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["change vector analysis","spectral change vectors","multitemporal images","automatic change-detection algorithms","multispectral remote sensing images","multitemporal remote sensing images"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Change detection","change vector analysis (CVA)","multitemporal images","polar representation","remote sensing","spherical representation","statistical models","unsupervised techniques"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039609/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"A Theoretical Framework for Unsupervised Change Detection Based on Change Vector Analysis in the Polar Domain","volume":"45","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4039609/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9258194","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Theoretical Framework for Unsupervised Change Detection Based on Change Vector Analysis in the Polar Domain","sourcePdf":"45tgrs01-bovolo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077357S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4039606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"277","xplore-issue":"4039606","articleId":"4039609","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":4039618,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Fischer","affiliation":["EADS Astrium GmbH, Friedrichshafen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/4039606/4039618/4039618-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Christian Fischer was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, in 1970.

The device has been called the GPS open-loop differential real-time receiver (GOLD-RTR). Its main and most innovative feature is its computation and storage, in real time, of complex-valued (<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$I$</tex></formula> and <formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex>$Q$</tex></formula>) cross correlations (waveforms) between GPS L1-C/A signals\u2014received directly and after reflection\u2014and the corresponding models of these signals. Particularly, the GOLD-RTR schedules consecutive coherent integration time slots of 1 ms over which ten parallel correlation channels, with 64 lags each, work simultaneously and continuously with the input raw data sampled at 40 MHz. The total throughput is 10\u2009000 waveforms per second, each waveform being 64 lags long. These real-time correlation resources can be flexibly distributed in several configurations according to the observational requirements, for instance: Doppler/delay maps or up to ten simultaneous reflected waveforms for ten different GPS satellites are examples of what can be done. The further processing of the real-time computed 1-ms waveforms in a flight campaign over the ocean, ice, or ground can be used to obtain geophysical parameters such as sea level and tides, sea surface mean-square slopes, ice roughness and thickness, soil moisture and biomass, or future applications. This paper covers the GOLD-RTR architecture and hardware, signal processing and data storage issues, machine\u2013user interface, laboratory readiness tests, and waveform data samples from the first two jet aircraft campaigns at 9300 m over the sea. </para>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Global Positioning System","Sea surface","Ice surface","Geophysics computing","Instruments","Signal design","Remote sensing","Reflection","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Doppler measurement","geophysical equipment","geophysical signal processing","Global Positioning System","radio receivers","remote sensing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPS-reflections receiver","Global Positioning System","Doppler maps","delay maps","ice surface","ground surface","Earth remote sensing","GPS open-loop differential real-time receiver","correlation channels","real-time correlation resources","sea level","sea tides","sea surface mean-square slopes","ice roughness","ice thickness","soil moisture","biomass","signal processing","data storage","machine-user interface","laboratory readiness tests","9300 m","40 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Altimeter","bistatic radar","global positioning system reflections (GPS-R)","GPS open-loop differential real-time receiver (GOLD-RTR)","passive reflectometry and interferometry system (PARIS) concept","radar systems","real-time correlation","scatterometer","waveforms"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2006.882257","startPage":"156","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4039606/04039626.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2006.882257","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GPS-Reflections Receiver That Computes Doppler/Delay Maps in Real Time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A GPS-Reflections Receiver That Computes Doppler/Delay Maps in Real Time","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"9258188","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","volume":"45","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4039626/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039626/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GPS-Reflections Receiver That Computes Doppler/Delay Maps in Real Time","sourcePdf":"45tgrs01-noguescorreig.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101441S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4039606","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"4039606","articleId":"4039626","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4039635,"authors":[{"name":"R.

This model permits a polarization basis invariant representation of coherent target scattering in terms of five independent target parameters, the magnitude and phase of the symmetric scattering type introduced in this paper, and the maximum polarization parameters (orientation, helicity, and maximum return). The new scattering vector model served for the assessment of the Cloude-Pottier incoherent target decomposition. Whereas the Cloude-Pottier scattering type alpha and entropy H are roll invariant, beta and the so-called target-phase parameters do depend on the target orientation angle for asymmetric scattering. The scattering vector model is then used as the basis for the development of new coherent and incoherent target decompositions in terms of unique and roll-invariant target parameters. It is shown that both the phase and magnitude of the symmetric scattering type should be used for an unambiguous description of symmetric target scattering.

A random graph will have sufficient expansion with high probability, and recent work shows that such graphs can be constructed efficiently. A key element of our method is the use of a dual witness: a zero-valued dual solution to the decoding linear program whose existence proves decoding success. We show that as long as no more than a certain constant fraction of the bits are flipped by the channel, we can find a dual witness. This new method can be used for proving bounds on the performance of any LP decoder, even in a probabilistic setting. Our result implies that the word error rate of the LP decoder decreases exponentially in the code length under the binary-symmetric channel (BSC). This is the first such error bound for LDPC codes using an analysis based on \"pseudocodewords.\" Recent work by Koetter and Vontobel shows that LP decoding and min-sum decoding of LDPC codes are closely related by the \"graph cover\" structure of their pseudocodewords; in their terminology, our result implies that that there exist families of LDPC codes where the minimum BSC pseudoweight grows linearly in the block length","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.887523","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039640","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.887523","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4039640/04039661.pdf","startPage":"82","endPage":"89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"LP Decoding Corrects a Constant Fraction of Errors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"LP Decoding Corrects a Constant Fraction of Errors","volume":"53","issue":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4039661/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9257669","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039661/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"LP Decoding Corrects a Constant Fraction of Errors","sourcePdf":"53tit01-feldman.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.147378S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4039640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"4039640","articleId":"4039661","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4039662,"authors":[{"name":"Marc P.

The traditional belief is that exact maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) of an uncoded sequence over this channel has exponential complexity in the channel coherence time. Thus, for slowly varying channels, i.e., channels having coherence time on the order of the sequence length, the complexity appears to be exponential in the sequence length. In the first part of this work, it is shown that exact MLSD can be computed with only polynomial worst case complexity in the sequence length regardless of the operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for equal-energy signal constellations. By establishing a relationship between the aforementioned complexity and the rank of the correlation matrix of the fading process, an understanding of how complexity of the optimal MLSD receiver varies as the channel dynamics change is provided. In the second part of this paper, the problem of decoding turbo-like codes in frequency-nonselective/time-selective fading channels without receiver CSI is examined. Using arguments similar to the ones used for the MLSD case, it is shown that the exact symbol-by-symbol soft-decision metrics (SbSSDMs) implied by the min-sum algorithm can be evaluated with polynomial worst case complexity in the sequence length regardless of SNR for equal-energy signal constellations. Finally, by simplifying some key steps in the polynomial-complexity algorithm, a family of fast, approximate algorithms is derived, which yield near-optimal performance","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4039640/04039671.pdf","startPage":"209","endPage":"223","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.887504","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.887504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039640","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4039671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Joint Detection/Estimation in Fading Channels With Polynomial Complexity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Polynomials","Frequency","Constellation diagram","Channel state information","Transmitters","Maximum likelihood detection","Maximum likelihood estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","correlation methods","fading channels","matrix algebra","maximum likelihood decoding","maximum likelihood detection","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal joint detection-estimation","fading channels","maximum-likelihood sequence detection","MLSD","correlation matrix","turbo-like codes","decoding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Maximum-likelihood sequence detection (MLSD)","optimal receivers","polynomial-complexity receivers","receiver complexity","soft-decision metrics","time-selective fading channels","turbo-like codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039671/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Joint Detection/Estimation in Fading Channels With Polynomial Complexity","volume":"53","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4039671/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9257678","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Joint Detection/Estimation in Fading Channels With Polynomial Complexity","sourcePdf":"53tit01-motedayenaval.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148628S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4039640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4039640","articleId":"4039671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4039674,"authors":[{"name":"Dana Porrat","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Computer Science, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel"],"firstName":"Dana","lastName":"Porrat","id":"37282055400"},{"name":"David N.

The use of bursty duty-cycled transmission reduces the channel uncertainty because the receiver has to estimate the channel only when transmission takes place, but the maximum amount of burstiness and hence the possible reduction of channel uncertainty both depend on the spectral efficiency of the modulation scheme used. This general principle is demonstrated by comparing the channel conditions that allow duty-cycled direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and pulse position modulation (PPM) to achieve the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel capacity in the wideband limit. We show that duty-cycled DSSS systems achieve the wideband capacity as long as the number of independently faded resolvable paths increases sublinearly with the bandwidth, while duty-cycled PPM systems can achieve the wideband capacity only if the number of paths increases sublogarithmically. The difference is due to the fact that DSSS is spectrally more efficient than PPM and hence allows more bursty transmission","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/4039640/04039674.pdf","startPage":"194","endPage":"208","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2006.887063","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2006.887063","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4039640","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4039674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Uncertainty in Ultra-Wideband Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Ultra wideband technology","AWGN","Spread spectrum communication","Bandwidth","Pulse modulation","Multipath channels","Frequency shift keying","Additive white noise","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","channel estimation","code division multiple access","pulse position modulation","spread spectrum communication","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ultra-wideband communication system","direct-sequence spread spectrum","DSSS","pulse position modulation","PPM","additive white Gaussian noise","AWGN channel capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel uncertainty","direct sequence spread spectrum","flash signaling","pulse position modulation (PPM)","spectral efficiency","wideband communications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4039674/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2007","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"26 December 2006","displayDocTitle":"Channel Uncertainty in Ultra-Wideband Communication Systems","volume":"53","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4039674/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2007","accessionNumber":"9257677","dateOfInsertion":"26 December 2006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Uncertainty in Ultra-Wideband Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"53tit01-porrat.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079172S","chronDate":"Jan.  2007","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"4039640","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4039640","articleId":"4039674","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2007","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4039677,"authors":[{"name":"Rajesh Sundaresan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Communication Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Rajesh","lastName":"Sundaresan","id":"37268314000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"4039677","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":355},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Entropy","Random variables","Cryptography","Information theory","Information geometry","Performance analysis","Humans","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation theory","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source uncertainty","information correlation","redundancy minimization","guessing","correlated side information","divergence quantity","Pythagorean property","Kullback-Leibler divergence"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":[" $f$-divergence","$I$-projection","guessing","information geometry","mismatch","Pythagorean identity","R\u00e9nyi entropy","R\u00e9nyi information divergence","redundancy","side information"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers the problem of guessing the realization of a finite alphabet source when some side information is provided.

One such important scenario is the multiple-access (MA) channel where communication occurs from many uncoordinated mobile users to a common base station receiver (i.e., multipoint-to-point). Unlike previous studies whose emphases were on the idealized spatially uncorrelated channels with Gaussian signaling inputs from users, this paper derives a general analytical expression for the asymptotic (in the sense of large-system limit) sum-rate of a MIMO-MA system where the transmitters and the receiver can have different spatial correlations, and the users' inputs are not necessarily Gaussian. In addition to the sum-rate formula that assumes optimal joint decoding at the base station, we also derive the asymptotic sum-rate of a more practical system which performs separate decoding (multiuser detection followed by a bank of temporal error-correction decoders). Our analytic formulae are important in that they reveal the sum-rate one's system can achieve given the spatial correlation structures at the transmitters and receiver, and the input signal distributions. For special cases that users are homogeneous or users have Gaussian inputs, our results degenerate to previously published results.

This correspondence first incorporates two preprocessing rules into order-w reprocessing and shows that, with appropriate choice of parameters, the proposed order-w reprocessing with preprocessing requires comparable complexity to order-w reprocessing but achieves asymptotically the performance of order-(w+2) reprocessing. To complement the MRB, a second basis is employed for practical SNRs and this approach is systematically extended to a multibasis order-w reprocessing scheme for high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

In our model, the nitride traps have a continuous energy distribution. A series of Frenkel-Poole (FP) excitation of trapped electrons to the conduction band and electron recapture into nitride traps feature the transitions between the conduction band and trap states. Conduction band electron tunneling via oxide traps created by high-voltage stress and trapped electron direct tunneling through the bottom oxide are included to describe various charge leakage paths. We measure the nitride-charge leakage current directly in a large-area device for comparison. This paper reveals that the charge-retention loss in a high-voltage stressed cell, with a thicker bottom oxide (5 nm), exhibits two stages. The charge-leakage current is limited by oxide trap-assisted tunneling in the first stage and, then, follows a 1/t time dependence due to the FP emission in the second stage.
