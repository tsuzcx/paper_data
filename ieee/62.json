The principal idea of the architecture design is based on the concept of batch processing. The batch processing design method can make handling the boundary data easier and provide easier controller design than the interleaving techniques. The latency of the architecture is 1. An example of using the l=4, l denotes filter length, is illustrated. The architecture can be easily expanded to a general case of the 2-D DWT including different filter length and arbitrary terminate decomposition level. The overall architecture has been successfully simulated with 14 data bits of Verilog behavioral model simulation to confirm the feasibility.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1997.620002","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/4892/13485/00620002.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1997.620002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13485","startPage":"481","endPage":"484 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new architecture for the 2-D discrete wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620002","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new architecture for the 2-D discrete wavelet transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620002/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5745724","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new architecture for the 2-D discrete wavelet transform","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00620002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.186912S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4892","citationCount":"1","articleId":"620002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":620037,"authors":[{"name":"J.

This paper describes a control scheme called virtual model control that addresses this issue. Virtual model control is a motion control language that uses simulations of imagined mechanical components to create forces, which are applied through real joint torques, thereby creating the illusion that the virtual components are connected to the robot. Due to the intuitive nature of this technique, designing a virtual model controller requires the same skills as designing the mechanism itself. A high level control system can be cascaded with the low level virtual model controller to modulate the parameters of the virtual mechanisms. Discrete commands from the high level controller would then result in fluid motion. Virtual model control has been applied to a physical bipedal walking robot. A simple algorithm utilizing a simple set of virtual components has successfully compelled the robot to walk continuously over level terrain.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.620037","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13464/00620037.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"198 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.620037","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620037/","displayDocTitle":"Virtual model control of a bipedal walking robot","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5678368","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual model control of a bipedal walking robot","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00620037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02637S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"117","articleId":"620037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":620039,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The hierarchical trajectory planning is composed of a trajectory generator and position generator. The position generator generates collision-free intermediate positions of the redundant manipulator. The trajectory generator generates a collision-free trajectory based on some intermediate positions sent from the position generator. To generate a collision-free trajectory of the redundant manipulator, the VEGA is applied to the hierarchical trajectory planning only based on forward kinematics. The VEGA realizes horizontal propagation and vertical inheritance of genetic information in a population of candidate solutions. The main operator of the VEGA is a reverse transcription operator, which plays the roles of a crossover and selection simultaneously. In this paper, self-adaptive mutation is applied to the VEGA for local search of trajectory planning to obtain higher performance and the quick solution. Simulation results of the hierarchical trajectory planning show that the VEGA can generate a collision-free trajectory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620039/","accessionNumber":"5678370","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Trajectory generation for redundant manipulator using virus evolutionary genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trajectory generation for redundant manipulator using virus evolutionary genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00620039.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04708S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"18","articleId":"620039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":620041,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this paper, we propose a method of stable motion generation of a biped locomotion robot. We apply the control of this proposed method with eight force sensors at the soles of the biped locomotion robot. The zero moment point (ZMP) is a well known index of stability in walking robots. ZMP is determined by the configuration of the robots. However, there are many configurations against the ZMP. Because of that, when we use ZMP as the stabilization index, we must select the best configuration in many stability configurations. Then it is a problem of which configurations are selected. In this paper, we solve the problem with recurrent neural networks. In both the single support and double support periods, we calculate the position of ZMP by using values from four force sensors at each sole, and actuation joints and the angles can be determined by recurrent neural networks without ZMP moving out from the supporting area of sole. We employ the recurrent neural networks with genetic algorithms for learning capability and self-adaptive mutation operator. Further, we build a biped locomotion robot in trial, which has 13 joints and verified that the calculated stable motion trajectory can be successfully applied to the practical biped locomotion.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620041/","accessionNumber":"5678372","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Stabilization control of biped locomotion robot based learning with GAs having self-adaptive mutation and recurrent neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stabilization control of biped locomotion robot based learning with GAs having self-adaptive mutation and recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00620041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056483S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"37","articleId":"620041","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":620042,"authors":[{"name":"O.

To automatically determine the optimal link lengths of a modular manipulator for a given, task, the algorithm is two step: determine the necessary configuration of the robot using kinematic equations and then determine the optimal link length using the proposed efficient genetic algorithm. Some of design examples are shown.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.620087","startPage":"507","endPage":"512 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13464/00620087.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.620087","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task based design of modular robot manipulator using efficient genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Robots","Manipulators","Genetic algorithms","Robotic assembly","Prototypes","Robotics and automation","Kinematics","Engine cylinders","Mechanical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manipulator kinematics","genetic algorithms","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["task based design","modular robot manipulator","efficient genetic algorithm","locking mechanism","coupling","decoupling","parallel connection method","optimal link lengths","necessary configuration","kinematic equations","optimal link length"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620087/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Task based design of modular robot manipulator using efficient genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5671750","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task based design of modular robot manipulator using efficient genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00620087.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042675S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"21","articleId":"620087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":620088,"authors":[{"name":"Yung-Feng Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yung-Feng Chiu","id":"37087280465"},{"name":"Li-Chen Fu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Li-Chen Fu","id":"37087000189"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3612-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"620088","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":59},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620088","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling algorithm","Flexible manufacturing systems","Optimal scheduling","Job shop scheduling","Dynamic scheduling","Processor scheduling","Biological cells","Production","Dispatching","Transportation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","genetic algorithms","production control","computational complexity","Petri nets","flexible manufacturing systems","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm embedded dynamic search strategy","Petri net model","FMS scheduling","flexible manufacturing system","chromosome representation","conflict resolutions","resource assignments","resource allocation","Petri net based schedule builder","near-optimal schedule","NP-complete problem","partial schedule","raw parts"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.620088","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13464/00620088.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"513","endPage":"518 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.620088","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A GA embedded dynamic search algorithm over a Petri net model for an FMS scheduling","abstract":"In this paper, a genetic algorithm (GA) embedded dynamic search strategy over a Petri net model provides a new scheduling method for a flexible manufacturing system (FMS). The chromosome representation of the search nodes is constructed directly from the Petri net model of an FMS, recording the information about all conflict resolutions, such as resource assignments and orders for resource allocation. The GA operators may enforce some change to the chromosome information in the next generation. A Petri net based schedule builder receives a chromosome and an initial marking as input, and then produces a near-optimal schedule. Due to the NP-complete nature of the scheduling problem of an FMS, we also propose a dynamic FMS scheduler incorporating the proposed GA embedded search scheme, which generates successive partial schedules, instead of generating a full schedule for all raw parts, as the production evolves.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620088/","accessionNumber":"5671751","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A GA embedded dynamic search algorithm over a Petri net model for an FMS scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A GA embedded dynamic search algorithm over a Petri net model for an FMS scheduling","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00620088.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05789S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"6","articleId":"620088","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":620095,"authors":[{"name":"Fan-Tien Cheng","affiliation":["Institute of Manufacturing Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Fan-Tien Cheng","id":"37087185821"},{"name":"Yu-Der Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yu-Der Lu","id":"37088209623"},{"name":"York-Yin Sun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"York-Yin Sun","id":"37087820026"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3612-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"620095","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620095","abstract":"The window-shaped obstacle avoidance problem is studied in this paper. Several research papers regarding obstacle avoidance including the method proposed by Zghal et al. (1992), which we believe is the most suitable for 3D window-shaped obstacle avoidance were studied. Consequently, several short-comings of the Zghal's method were discovered. The Zghal's method will produce a chattering problem due to its deficiency in determining the shortest distance between the manipulator links and the window edges. This paper proposes a new scheme to determine the shortest distance. This new scheme will remedy the chattering problem. Moreover, the most dangerous link (MDL) method is developed to further improve the effectiveness and efficiency. Because the MDL method only considers the most dangerous link in the performance criterion, the online weighting assignment problem of the Zghal's method is removed, also, less redundancy is required to accomplish the goal for obstacle avoidance. Therefore, the MDL method will allow more redundancy to be useful for the other goals under multiple-goal application environments.","doi":"10.1109/ROBOT.1997.620095","startPage":"556","endPage":"561 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel3/4815/13464/00620095.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of International Conference on Robotics and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROBOT.1997.620095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13464","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Window-shaped obstacle avoidance for a redundant manipulator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manipulators","Quadratic programming","Orbital robotics","Space stations","Kinematics","Manufacturing","Motion control","Councils","Contracts","Sun"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["path planning","manipulator kinematics","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["redundant manipulator","3D window-shaped obstacle avoidance","chattering problem","most dangerous link method","MDL method","performance criterion","online weighting assignment problem","multiple-goal application environments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620095/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"Window-shaped obstacle avoidance for a redundant manipulator","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","accessionNumber":"5671758","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Window-shaped obstacle avoidance for a redundant manipulator","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00620095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078205S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"2","articleId":"620095","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":620111,"authors":[{"name":"R.

As an example, this paper develops an assist interface for a robotic system called the dual-arm work module (DAWM). The DAWM has seventeen independent degrees of freedom arranged to give the system five degrees of kinematic redundancy. These five extra kinematic resources (extra joints) give the DAWM the versatility to perform a wide range of tasks, including: disassembly, cutting, material transport, and decontamination. In the current application scenario, the operator positions each redundant joint directly and independently of the other joints. Because of obstacles and kinematic coupling, even an experienced operator may need to reposition the extra joints several times while performing a task. The simulated annealing optimization algorithm considers obstacles and performance criteria while generating suggested options for positioning the extra joints (configuration options). The operator interface then presents these options using computer graphics. The interface should reduce the amount of time the operator spends positioning the extra joints and perhaps improve the quality of the work.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620111/","accessionNumber":"5671771","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"25-25 April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A simulated annealing optimization algorithm implemented within an operator-assist interface","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simulated annealing optimization algorithm implemented within an operator-assist interface","confLoc":"Albuquerque, NM, USA","sourcePdf":"00620111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039982S","chronDate":"20-25 Apr 1997","isNumber":"13464","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4815","citationCount":"1","articleId":"620111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":620123,"authors":[{"name":"S.M.

The search and rescue program was written using MOVER, a programming system for distributed tasks. The system provides high-level programming constructs for task distribution across robots. Finally, MOVER encourages code re-use because the task distribution mechanism can synchronize any set of procedures (without rewriting), allowing the programmer of a distributed task to access libraries of robot software written for single-robot tasks.","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.1997.620182","publicationTitle":"1997 8th International Conference on Advanced Robotics.

The new method has more stable dynamic characteristic, since lag time of the control loop is smaller due to the symmetric structure of the system. The master-slave system consists of two isomorphic parallel manipulators. Good features with parallel manipulator also improve the system stability. The stability of the proposed control method including the simple operator and object dynamics is analysed by using the Hurwitz stability criterion and then compared with the conventional controller.

The sensory information including target location with respect to current location of the mobile robot, have been discretely conserved using a two dimensional Kohonen lattice. Reinforcement learning based on a stochastic real valued technique have been implemented to compute the action space for this Kohonen lattice. The proposed scheme learns the input and output weight space of the Kohonen lattice which is generalized to any workspace. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been established by simulation where the complete domain of the input-space is quantized based on experience on sensory data encountered in real-time. The input-output mapping conserved by the Kohonen lattice during simulation was used to guide a mobile robot in a real-time environment. Successful navigation of the mobile robot without further training confirms the robustness of the proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.1997.620222","startPage":"459","endPage":"464","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 8th International Conference on Advanced Robotics.

For this, a disturbance observer is applied to each joint of an n degrees of freedom manipulator to obtain a simple equivalent robot dynamics (SERD) being represented as an n independent double integrator system. For an arbitrary trajectory generated for a given path in Cartesian space, whenever the saturation of any actuators is met, the desired acceleration of the nominal trajectory in Cartesian space is modified online by using SERD. Also an integral action with respect to the difference between the nominal and the modified trajectories is utilized in nonsaturated region of actuators to reduce the path error. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, numerical simulations and real experiments are performed for two degrees of freedom SCARA type direct-drive arm.","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.1997.620251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR.1997.620251","publicationTitle":"1997 8th International Conference on Advanced Robotics.

This development is based on the discrete hidden Markov model in conjunction with vector quantization algorithm, endpoint detection algorithm for syllable endpoint detection and separation, and time normalization algorithm. The 70-Thai word vocabulary is subdivided into four sets comprising single, double, and triple syllabled words, 20 words in each set, and the last set consists of 10-Thai numeric words, zero to nine. The separated speech training set and testing set are composed of both male and female speakers within the range of 18 to 25 years old. For the tonal characteristics of the Thai language, the algorithms and the model parameters are modified in order to be applicable to the Thai language. The experiments on the effects of model parameter variations on recognition rate are conducted. The model parameters are number of codebooks, number of model states, and number of training speakers. The results show that the increase in the number of codebook and the number of model states have the major effect on the recognition rates.

Since we have two different media with different characteristics, the analysis will be difficult because the behavior of the system will be dependent on both voice and data offered loads. We get over this difficulty profiting from the characteristics of both media.

This filter operates on the outputs of matched filters which are matched to the original code waveforms of system. A maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the parameters of the decorrelating filter is proposed and derived. The estimation method is based on inserting known trailing sequences into the information data by all users simultaneously. To achieve the minimum mean square error (MMSE) in the estimation, a criterion for selecting the training sequences is suggested. Orthogonal training sequences are good candidates to approach the MMSE. The estimation method requires a matrix inversion at the end of each training period. An iterative matrix inversion method is suggested to distribute the computational load of the matrix inversion over the training period. The simulation results show some degradations in system performance compared to the case where a perfect knowledge of the channel is assumed. This degradation is clearly due to errors in the channel estimation.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1997.620338","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","pdfPath":"/iel3/4892/13486/00620338.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1997.620338","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13486","startPage":"615","endPage":"619 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Symbol-aided channel estimation and multiuser detection for CDMA systems using a decorrelating detector","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620338","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Symbol-aided channel estimation and multiuser detection for CDMA systems using a decorrelating detector","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620338/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5752854","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Symbol-aided channel estimation and multiuser detection for CDMA systems using a decorrelating detector","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00620338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063499S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4892","citationCount":"3","articleId":"620338","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":620341,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

An XLINK XC4005 was used as a processor for the multilayer network of 128-input digital neural gates. The neural gate is functionally similar to that of an analog gate except that its weights are limited to +1, 0 and -1, and the digital inputs are +1 and -1. Using these discrete weight and input values greatly simplify the discrimination function of the gate and hence could be implemented in digital circuits. The gate consists of N-input, N-bit weight vector and a threshold with value equal to K. A digital K-of-N (K/N) neural gate will 'fire' if the number of bits that matches between the input and the weight vector is K or more. The weight vectors and the K threshold values are stored in an EPROM together with their layered connectivity. Depending upon the architecture several gates may be processed simultaneously, like a vector operation. The XLINK XC4005 microprogrammed control unit supervises the processing and sequencing of the instructions. The system is tested to recognized 90 hand printed digits.","doi":"10.1109/PACRIM.1997.620381","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","startPage":"802","endPage":"806 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PACRIM.1997.620381","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13486","pdfPath":"/iel3/4892/13486/00620381.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Communications, Computers and Signal Processing, PACRIM. 10 Years Networking the Pacific Rim, 1987-1997","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Pattern recognition","Operational amplifiers","Very large scale integration","Digital circuits","Supervised learning","Hopfield neural networks","Adders","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","digital circuits","logic gates","threshold logic","character recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital neural network","XLINK XC4000","multilayer network","digital neural gates","discrimination function","EPROM","hand printed digit recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Digital neural network on a XLINK XC4000","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620381/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5745759","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital neural network on a XLINK XC4000","confLoc":"Victoria, BC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00620381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032651S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4892","articleId":"620381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":620397,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.

Most previous work has concentrated on deterministic k-fault-tolerant (k-FT) designs in which exactly k spare processors and some spare switches and links are added to construct multiprocessors that can tolerate any k processor faults. However, after k faults are reconfigured around, much of the extra links and switches can remain unutilized. It is possible within the basic node-covering framework, which was introduced by Dutt and Hayes as an efficient k-FT design method, to design FT multiprocessors that have the same amount of switches and links as, say, a two-FT deterministic design, but have s spare processors, where s/spl Gt/2, so that, on the average, k=/spl Theta/(s) (k/spl les/s) processor failures can be reconfigured around. Such designs utilize the spare link and switch capacity very efficiently, and are called probabilistic FT designs. An elegant and powerful method to construct covering graphs or CG's, which are key to obtaining the probabilistic FT designs, is to use linear error-correcting codes (ECCs). We show how to construct probabilistic designs with very high average fault tolerance but low wiring and switch overhead using ECCs like the 2D-parity, full-two, 3D-parity, and full-three codes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Node-covering, error-correcting codes and multiprocessors with very high average fault tolerance","doi":"10.1109/12.620481","startPage":"997","endPage":"1015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.620481","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13505","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/13505/00620481.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620481","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620481/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Node-covering, error-correcting codes and multiprocessors with very high average fault tolerance","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712269","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Node-covering, error-correcting codes and multiprocessors with very high average fault tolerance","sourcePdf":"00620481.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047537S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13505","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"17","articleId":"620481","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":620490,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Telecom providers and operators are now required to open up their primary revenue channels to competing industries. The competition for product differentiation increasingly depends on the level of sophistication, degree of flexibility, and speed of deployment of services that a future provider can offer. These factors in turn depend heavily on the flexibility of the software architecture in place in a provider's operational infrastructure. Within this context, we examine the service architecture of two major global communication networks-the telephone network and the Internet and explore their weaknesses and strengths. We discuss the realization of an open programmable networking environment based on a new service architecture for advanced telecommunication services that overcomes the limitations of the existing networks. Our approach to network programmability stems from two angles-one conceptual, the other implementational. In the first, we attempt to develop a service model that is open and reflects the economic market structure of the future telecommunications service industry. Furthermore, we introduce an extended reference model for realizing the service marketplace and present it as a vehicle for creating multimedia services with QoS guarantees. In the second, we investigate the feasibility of engineering the reference model from an implementation standpoint. We describe a realization of the open programmable networking environment as a broadband kernel. Called xbind, the broadband kernel incorporates IP and CORBA technologies for signaling, management, and service creation, and ATM for transport. We also address some of the important QoS, performance, scalability, and implementation issues.","doi":"10.1109/65.620517","startPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","pdfPath":"/iel3/65/13498/00620517.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/65.620517","endPage":"18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Programming telecommunication networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620517/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep/Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Programming telecommunication networks","volume":"11","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5713338","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Programming telecommunication networks","sourcePdf":"00620517.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057042S","chronDate":"Sep/Oct 1997","isNumber":"13498","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"82","articleId":"620517","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":620521,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Annex B defines a low-bit-rate silence compression scheme designed and optimized to work in conjunction with both the full version of G.729 and its low-complexity Annex A. To achieve good quality low-bit-rate silence compression, a robust frame-based voice activity detector module is essential to detect inactive voice frames, also called silence or background noise frames. For these detected inactive voice frames, a discontinuous transmission module measures the changes over time of the inactive voice signal characteristics and decides whether a new silence information descriptor frame should be sent to maintain the reproduction quality of the background noise at the receiving end. If such a frame is needed, the spectrum and energy parameters describing the perceptual characteristics of the background noise are efficiently coded and transmitted using 15 b/frame. At the receiving end, the comfort noise generation module regenerates the output background noise using transmitted updates or previously available parameters. The synthesized background noise is obtained by linear predictive filtering of a locally generated pseudo-white excitation signal of a controlled level. This method of coding the background noise enables the achievement of bit-rate savings for coded speech at average rates as low as 4 kb/s during normal speech conversation while maintaining reproduction quality.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/13503/00620527.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"73","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/35.620527","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.620527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13503","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620527","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ITU-T Recommendation G.729 Annex B: a silence compression scheme for use with G.729 optimized for V.70 digital simultaneous voice and data applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Background noise","Speech enhancement","Speech coding","Design optimization","Noise robustness","Detectors","Noise measurement","Time measurement","Noise generators","Signal synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code standards","telecommunication standards","speech codecs","speech coding","data communication","voice communication","digital communication","data compression","speech intelligibility"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ITU-T Recommendation G.729 Annex B","silence compression","V.70 digital simultaneous voice-data applications","low bit rate silence compression","low complexity Annex A","frame based voice activity detector module","inactive voice frames","background noise frames","discontinuous transmission module","inactive voice signal characteristics","silence information descriptor frame","reproduction quality","background noise","energy parameters","spectrum parameters","perceptual characteristics","comfort noise generation module","output background noise","linear predictive filtering","pseudowhite excitation signal","coded speech","normal speech conversation","4 kbit/s","8 kbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"ITU-T Recommendation G.729 Annex B: a silence compression scheme for use with G.729 optimized for V.70 digital simultaneous voice and data applications","volume":"35","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712803","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ITU-T Recommendation G.729 Annex B: a silence compression scheme for use with G.729 optimized for V.70 digital simultaneous voice and data applications","sourcePdf":"00620527.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090776S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"196","articleId":"620527","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":620531,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It is believed to be a fast and cost-effective means to provide local phone service in rural areas and third world countries. WLL is a fixed radio communication system; narrowbeam antennas can be employed at both the base station and subscriber's side at high spots so that the propagation between base station and house is very close to free space propagation. This gives the WLL system many inherent advantages over the traditional cellular system, such as bigger coverage area, low power, reduced interference, higher capacity, no fast fading, and no handoff. In this article ideal multiple-tier hexagonal cells are used to derive the capacity of a CDMA WLL system. First, the reverse link interference from each tier to the center cell is calculated separately. Then, the interference ratio of reverse links in a WLL system is analytically derived as a function of total tier number. The result shows that interference from other cells is proportional to the beam width of the house antenna. The authors also found that tier number plays a vital role in system capacity in a free-space propagation (20 dB/dec) environment. At the extreme, the system capacity will drop to zero for an infinite-tier cell structure. A WLL simulator is also built to verify the authors' analytical solution.","doi":"10.1109/35.620532","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/35/13503/00620532.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/35.620532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13503","startPage":"110","endPage":"114","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of narrowbeam antenna and multiple tiers on system capacity in CDMA wireless local loop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The effect of narrowbeam antenna and multiple tiers on system capacity in CDMA wireless local loop","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"35","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712808","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of narrowbeam antenna and multiple tiers on system capacity in CDMA wireless local loop","sourcePdf":"00620532.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057999S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"12","articleId":"620532","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":620533,"authors":[{"name":"B.P.

This approach has a number of advantages: it combines rule based (structural) and classification tests; feature extraction is inexpensive; and execution time is independent of character font and size. The technique can be divided into three major steps: The first step is preprocessing in which the original image is transformed into a binary image utilizing a 300 dpi scanner and then forming the connected component. Second, global features of the input Arabic word are then extracted such as number of subwords, number of peaks within the subword, number and position of the complementary character, etc. Finally, an artificial neural network is used for character classification. The algorithm was implemented on a powerful MS-DOS microcomputer and written in C.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620576","pdfPath":"/iel3/4891/13496/00620576.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"615 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recognition of printed Arabic text using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620576/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Recognition of printed Arabic text using neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5704649","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recognition of printed Arabic text using neural networks","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00620576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05016S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4891","citationCount":"10","articleId":"620576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":620580,"authors":[{"name":"D.

We compare multiexpert and multistage combination techniques and discuss in detail in a comparative manner methods for combining multiple learners: voting, mixture of experts, stacking, boosting and cascading. In pen based handwritten character recognition, the input is the dynamic movement of the pentip over the pressure sensitive tablet. There is also the image formed as a result of this movement. On a real world database, we notice that the two multi layer perceptron (MLP) neural network based classifiers using these representations separately make errors on different patterns, implying that a suitable combination of the two would lead to higher accuracy. Thus we implement and compare voting, mixture of experts, stacking and cascading. Combined classifiers have an error percentage less than individual ones. The final combined system of two MLPs has less complexity and memory requirement than a single k nearest neighbor using one of the representations.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4891/13496/00620583.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"640 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining multiple representations and classifiers for pen-based handwritten digit recognition","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620583","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620583","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620583","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620583/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Combining multiple representations and classifiers for pen-based handwritten digit recognition","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5704655","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining multiple representations and classifiers for pen-based handwritten digit recognition","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00620583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023727S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4891","citationCount":"35","articleId":"620583","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":620584,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Since context dependent models were successfully introduced to speech recognition (R. Bahl et al., 1980; R. Schwartz et al., 1984; K. Lee, 1990), it seems obvious, that the use of trigraphs could also lead to improved online handwriting recognition systems (A. Kosmala et al., 1997). In analogy to triphones in speech recognition, trigraphs are context dependent sub word units representing a single written character in its left and right context. The tests were conducted on a writer dependent system with three different writers and two different vocabulary sizes (1000 words and 30000 words). The results we obtained with the trigaph based system compared to the monograph system, are very encouraging: a mean relative error reduction of 46% for the 1000 word handwriting recognition system and a mean relative error reduction of 37% for the same system with the 30000 word vocabulary. We believe that this represents one of the first systematic investigations of the influence of context dependent models and parameter reduction methods for a difficult large vocabulary handwriting recognition task.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620584","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4891/13496/00620584.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13496","startPage":"641","endPage":"644 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved on-line handwriting recognition using context dependent hidden Markov models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=620584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Improved on-line handwriting recognition using context dependent hidden Markov models","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620584/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5704656","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved on-line handwriting recognition using context dependent hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00620584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052889S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4891","citationCount":"13","articleId":"620584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":620592,"authors":[{"name":"K.S.

An image is first divided into a series of sub blocks with size 8/spl times/8 pixels. Then each of them is transformed by a discrete cosine transform (DCT) using a structured ANN. Then, all the sub blocks are sorted into 4 classes using another layer of structured ANN, according to their level of activity within each sub block. Adaptivity is provided by assigning bits between classes. The neural network used is a structured one instead of a fully connected one, so that convergency and speed of learning are dramatically improved. Each subnetwork is trained and tested independently. Excellent performance is achieved, in comparison to traditional fully connected neural network image compression methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620592","startPage":"675","endPage":"678 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13496","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4891/13496/00620592.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network for discrete cosine transform and image compression","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620592/","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural network for discrete cosine transform and image compression","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5704664","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural network for discrete cosine transform and image compression","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00620592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037394S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4891","citationCount":"4","articleId":"620592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":620602,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

We consider a Madaline architecture for a 2-group classification problem and concentrate on the probability density function for the neural activation of the first-layer units. As the following layers perform a Boolean table, the expectation value of the output is determined, utilizing the probability of a pattern to perform a definite binary input for the Boolean table. The Madaline architecture can be modified to the introduced /spl Sigma/-/spl Pi/-/spl Sigma/ network, which evaluates the expectation value. Several assumptions on the distribution of the neural activation lead to a clear and simple architecture, which is applied to an OCR problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620676","startPage":"1087","endPage":"1091 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel3/4891/13496/00620676.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDAR.1997.620676","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modification of hard-limiting multilayer neural networks for confidence evaluation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multi-layer neural network","Neural networks","Piecewise linear techniques","Neurons","Feedforward neural networks","Circuit synthesis","Optical character recognition software","Backpropagation","Boolean functions","Nonhomogeneous media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical character recognition","multilayer perceptrons","feedforward neural nets","Boolean functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hard-limiting multilayer neural networks","confidence evaluation","Madaline architecture","2-group classification problem","probability density function","neural activation","Boolean table","definite binary input","OCR problem"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/620676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Modification of hard-limiting multilayer neural networks for confidence evaluation","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5704748","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modification of hard-limiting multilayer neural networks for confidence evaluation","confLoc":"Ulm, Germany","sourcePdf":"00620676.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051389S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13496","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4891","citationCount":"1","articleId":"620676","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":620688,"authors":[{"name":"M.T.

Future possibilities to obtain much higher Jc's are discussed in relation to crystal alignment, connectivity between grains and flux pinning. High amperage wires and high strength wires were also developed for large scale magnet application. High I/sub c/ of over 300 A at 77 K were obtained for the wire with large cross sectional area. Good stress and strain tolerant characteristics were also obtained for silver alloy sheathed wires. In order to apply the HTS wires for AC use, it is necessary to reduce AC loss. So, the AC loss of the wires are also discussed. As a progress of wire technology, we have fabricated many types of magnets, such as pancake magnets and solenoidal magnets. In the case of 77 K application, it is promising to apply for AC use because of large heat capacity of HTS wires and liquid nitrogen. So, we are developing the 500 kVA transformer and pulse magnet for SMES. A refrigerator cooled magnet operated near 20K was fabricated. This magnet was operated at 21 K and generated 3 T inside a /spl phi/40 mm room temperature bore, stably generated 2.5 T continuously for over 150 hours and could be operated at high ramp rate of over 12 T/min. As for the 4.2 K operation, high field insert magnet for 1 GHz NMR application are developed. Highest magnetic field of 24 T was achieved using the hybrid magnet at MIT and persistent current mode operation was done by using the layer wound coil with persistent current switch.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621031/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","volume":"7","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5676561","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Development of Ag-sheathed Bi2223 superconducting wires and their application to magnets","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development of Ag-sheathed Bi2223 superconducting wires and their application to magnets","sourcePdf":"00621031.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038492S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13489","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"10","articleId":"621031","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":621111,"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7381-0694-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"621111","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1591},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"Energy Storage & Stationary Battery Committee of the IEEE Power and Energy Society"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lead"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["lead"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Pb-acid secondary batteries","DC load definition","lead-acid battery sizing","stationary battery applications","full float operations","IEEE recommended practice"]}],"abstract":"Methods for defining the DC load and for sizing a lead-acid battery to supply that load for stationary battery applications in full float operations are described.

This allows an accurate computation of the correlations that may exist between blocks of bits in consecutive patterns, and that can be successfully exploited to determine an encoding which minimizes the bus transition activity.

Because it successfully (and simultaneously) exploits both types of parallelism, SMT processors use resources more efficiently, and both instruction throughput and speedups are greater.","doi":"10.1109/40.621209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13512","startPage":"12","endPage":"19","pdfPath":"/iel1/40/13512/00621209.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Micro","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/40.621209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simultaneous multithreading: a platform for next-generation processors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multithreading","Surface-mount technology","Hardware","Registers","Bandwidth","Counting circuits","Dynamic scheduling","Lifting equipment","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel architectures","parallel machines","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel","simultaneous multithreading","processor design","instruction-level parallelism","thread-level parallelism","SMT processors","next-generation processors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous multithreading: a platform for next-generation processors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621209/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.-Oct.  1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"17","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5717882","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous multithreading: a platform for next-generation processors","sourcePdf":"00621209.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037281S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  1997","isNumber":"13512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"208","articleId":"621209","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":621215,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These transformations, referred to as dynamic algorithm transformations (DAT), jointly optimize algorithm and circuit performance measures such as signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and power dissipation (P/sub D/), respectively. A DAT-based signal processing system is composed of a signal monitoring algorithm (SMA) block and a signal processing algorithm (SPA) block. First, computation of the theoretical power-optimum SPA configuration incorporating signal transition activity is presented. Next, practical SMA schemes are developed, which achieved power reduction by a combination of powering down the filter taps and modifying the coefficients. The DAT-based adaptive filter is then employed as a near-end cross-talk (NEXT) canceller in 155.52 Mb/s ATM-LAN over category 3 wiring. Simulation results indicate that the power savings for the NEXT canceller range from 21%-62% as the cable length varies from 100 meters to 70 meters.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/4894/13495/00621271.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13495","startPage":"161","endPage":"166","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic algorithm transformations (DAT) for low-power adaptive signal processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=621271","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic algorithm transformations (DAT) for low-power adaptive signal processing","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621271/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5745248","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic algorithm transformations (DAT) for low-power adaptive signal processing","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00621271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061357S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","isNumber":"13495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4894","citationCount":"5","articleId":"621271","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":621275,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

This method is a generalization of the exact signal probability evaluation method due to Parker and McCluskey, which as been extended to handle temporal correlation and arbitrary transport delays. Our method is parameterized by a single parameter l, which determines the speed-accuracy tradeoff. l indicates the depth in terms of logic levels over which spatial signal correlation is taken into account. This is done by only taking into account reconvergent paths whose length is at most l. The rationale is that ignoring spatial correlation for signals that reconverge after many levels of logic introduces negligible error. We present results that show that the error in the switching activity and power estimates is very small even for small values of l. In fact, for most of the examples we tried, power estimates with l=1 are within 5% of the exact. However, this error can be higher than 20% for some examples, More robust estimates are obtained with l=2, providing a good compromise between speed and accuracy.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","accessionNumber":"5745252","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Switching activity estimation using limited depth reconvergent path analysis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Switching activity estimation using limited depth reconvergent path analysis","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00621278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046236S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","isNumber":"13495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4894","citationCount":"26","articleId":"621278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":621283,"authors":[{"name":"E.

This paper presents a method for encoding an external address bus which lowers its activity and, thus, decreases the energy. This method relies on the locality of memory references. Since applications favor a few working zones of their address space at each instant, for an address to one of these zones only the offset of this reference with respect to the previous reference to that zone needs to be sent over the bus, along with an identifier of the current working zone. This is combined with a modified one-shot encoding for the offset. An estimate of the area and energy overhead of the encoder/decoder are given; their effect is small. The approach has been applied to two memory-intensive examples, obtaining a bus-activity reduction of about 2/3 in both of them.

We look at two major approaches and evaluate the best alternative for power reduction. We first consider a shift register FIFO implementation and look at reducing the switching activity for the arithmetic operations with a change in the addition algorithm. The correlation calculation can be modified to include storage of the previous result so that arithmetic circuits need only compute the difference between the present and next value. A binary adder tree with bypass can then reduce power by shutting off unnecessary computations. We then look at minimizing the power for sample storage by limiting the amount of data moved per cycle. This can be achieved by using a register file FIFO implementation. Interestingly the two power minimization techniques, bypass adder tree and register file FIFO implementation, were found to be strongly non-orthogonal, with the final effect that the register file changes the data statistics in such a way that it cancels the savings for the adder tree with bypass. The final solution of a register file with standard adder tree was found to have the lowest power dissipation. Using Bus-Invert for encoding the data as it enters the FIFO further reduces the power consumption due to the global bus of the register file.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621287/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","accessionNumber":"5745259","displayDocTitle":"Power reduction techniques for a spread spectrum based correlator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power reduction techniques for a spread spectrum based correlator","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00621287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021258S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","isNumber":"13495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4894","citationCount":"10","articleId":"621287","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":621295,"authors":[{"name":"M.

These prior works have used simplified models for device switching speed and power dissipation. In the present work we take more detailed account of parameter tolerances, take full account of short channel effects in the devices, and carry out full circuit simulations to obtain accurate speed and power information.","doi":"10.1145/263272.263364","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","pdfPath":"/iel3/4894/13495/00621308.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13495","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1145/263272.263364","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 International Symposium on Low Power Electronics and Design","startPage":"317","endPage":"322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supply and threshold voltage optimization for low power design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=621308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","displayDocTitle":"Supply and threshold voltage optimization for low power design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621308/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5745277","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2005","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supply and threshold voltage optimization for low power design","confLoc":"Monterey, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00621308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047032S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 1997","isNumber":"13495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4894","citationCount":"16","articleId":"621308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":621369,"authors":[{"name":"Sangku Kim","affiliation":["TCAD Dept, LG Semicon Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sangku Kim","id":"37615456800"},{"name":"Kwangsun Yang","affiliation":["TCAD Dept, LG Semicon Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwangsun Yang","id":"37614437300"},{"name":"Junho Baek","affiliation":["TCAD Dept, LG Semicon Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Junho Baek","id":"37065946600"},{"name":"Choonkyung Kim","affiliation":["TCAD Dept, LG Semicon Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Choonkyung Kim","id":"37615746900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3775-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"621369","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","Threshold voltage","Compressive stress","Doping profiles","Random access memory","Boron","Thickness measurement","Ion implantation","Predictive models","Isolation technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MOSFET","CMOS integrated circuits","isolation technology","semiconductor process modelling","stress effects","internal stresses","semiconductor device models","integrated circuit modelling","diffusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anomalous narrow width effect","nMOSFET","LOCOS/NSL isolation","compressive stress","anomalous threshold voltage characteristics","nitride sidewall LOCOS isolation","2D process simulation","3D device simulation","channel stop dopant","submicron device threshold characteristics","dopant-point diffusion"]}],"abstract":"The anomalous threshold voltage characteristics of narrow width nMOSFET fabricated with LOGOS and Nitride Sidewall (NSL) LOCOS isolation is predicted by means of 2D process and 3D device simulation.

We, for the first time in our knowledge, describe the problems of the previous methods and propose a new method to overcome them. It is based on the time-stamped transition density and a new formula considering inertial-delay effect in the probabilistic domain. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of our proposed method.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay effects","Switching circuits","Circuit simulation","Probabilistic logic","Filters","Energy consumption","Very large scale integration","Circuits and systems","Combinational circuits","Delay estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["combinational circuits","logic design","delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inertial delay","switching activity","time-stamped transition density","combinational circuit","logic simulation","probabilistic property","deterministic property"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.621419","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13529/00621419.pdf","startPage":"1528","endPage":"1531 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13529","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.621419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of inertial-delay dependent switching activities by using time-stamped transition density","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=621419","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of inertial-delay dependent switching activities by using time-stamped transition density","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621419/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5745037","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of inertial-delay dependent switching activities by using time-stamped transition density","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00621419.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025181S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"1","articleId":"621419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":621421,"authors":[{"name":"Chua-Chin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chua-Chin Wang","id":"37068528600"},{"name":"Cheng-Pin Kwan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Sun Yat-Sen University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Cheng-Pin Kwan","id":"37609700400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3583-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"621421","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":33},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power technology mapping by hiding high-transition paths in invisible edges for LUT-based FPGAs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=621421","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Switches","Circuits","Programmable logic arrays","Tree graphs","Electric resistance","Routing","Surges","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["table lookup","field programmable gate arrays","logic CAD","circuit layout CAD","integrated circuit layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low power technology mapping","high-transition paths","LUT-based FPGAs","lookup-table-based FPGA","FPGA routing channels","power-saving technology mapping algorithm","mapped logic circuits"]}],"abstract":"Considering that the connection switches possessing large resistance and capacitance in lookup-table-based (LUT-based) Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) routing channels consume a great portion of total power, a power-saving technology mapping algorithm is proposed tending to reduce the transition density on \"visible\" edges of the mapped logic circuits by hiding the paths with high transition activity in \"invisible\" edges.

Different structures and learning methods are investigated for both approaches to function approximation and pattern recognition. Main emphasis is placed upon static and dynamic neural nets that are used as predictors of nonlinear models for symptom generation. Dynamic neural networks are properly integrated into a generalized observer scheme. The goal is to achieve an adequate approximation of process outputs for each known class of system behavior. Symptoms are then evaluated by means of pattern classification. Application to a laboratory process is presented.

The radix-2 signed-digit (SD) redundant arithmetic is used to reduce the carry-propagation delay in the conventional binary adders. The pipelined structure is adopted to increase the throughput rate while the on-line (digit-serial) arithmetic reduces the hardware cost and I/O requirement. Compared to previously proposed methods, the new redundant and on-line CORDIC preserves the constant scaling factor, an important merit of the original CORDIC, and thus does not require any complicated division or variable scaling factor calculation. Furthermore, it can perform both the CORDIC evaluation for angle calculation and the CORDIC application for rotations.

Then, the inherent symmetry of the trigonometric functions is further exploited to render a hardware-efficient, systolic structure. For the computation of any N-point DXT of interest, the proposed structure requires only about N/2 multipliers and N adders, thus providing substantial hardware savings compared with previous works. Furthermore, the new scheme can be easily adapted to compute any type of DXT with only minor modification. The complete I/O buffers have been addressed as well which allows for a continuous flow of successive blocks of input data and transformed results in natural order.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13529/00621569.pdf","startPage":"2092","endPage":"2095 vol.3","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.621569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.621569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13529","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=621569","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient unified systolic architecture for the computation of discrete trigonometric transforms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Discrete transforms","Discrete Fourier transforms","Discrete cosine transforms","Fourier transforms","Hardware","Very large scale integration","Signal processing","Filters","Costs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","discrete Fourier transforms","Hartley transforms","systolic arrays","mathematics computing","digital signal processing chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unified systolic architecture","discrete trigonometric transforms","discrete Fourier transform","DFT","discrete Hartley transform","DHT","discrete cosine transform","DCT","discrete sine transform","DST","Clenshaw recurrence formula","trigonometric functions","hardware-efficient structure","I/O buffers","DSP"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","displayDocTitle":"An efficient unified systolic architecture for the computation of discrete trigonometric transforms","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5745177","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient unified systolic architecture for the computation of discrete trigonometric transforms","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00621569.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029315S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"12","articleId":"621569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":621571,"authors":[{"name":"Si-Jung Chang","affiliation":["Department of Information & Communications Engineering, Chonbuk National University of Korea, South Korea"],"lastName":"Si-Jung Chang","id":"37351457800"},{"name":"Moon Ho Lee","lastName":"Moon Ho Lee","id":"37087000870"},{"name":"Jin-Jong Cha","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin-Jong Cha","id":"37346617000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3583-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"621571","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Parallel architectures","Filters","Signal processing","Frequency","Signal processing algorithms","Filtering","Telecommunication computing","Computer architecture","Wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transforms","wavelet transforms","parallel architectures","digital signal processing chips","mathematics computing","digital filters","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel architecture","discrete wavelet transform","DWT","pyramid algorithm","even filter","odd filter","lowpass filter","highpass filter","octave computation"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we present a simple parallel architecture for Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT).

By proper array processing and applying hardware annealing technique, the VLSI implementation of optimal multiuser detector (OMD) is suitable.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.621576","startPage":"2120","endPage":"2123 vol.3","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.621576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13529","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13529/00621576.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network based CDMA detector with robust near-far resistance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621576/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network based CDMA detector with robust near-far resistance","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"5745184","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based CDMA detector with robust near-far resistance","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00621576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027988S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","articleId":"621576","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":621578,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Digit-serial multipliers obtained using traditional unfolding techniques cannot be pipelined beyond a certain level because of the presence of feedback loops. In this paper, an alternative approach for the design of digit-serial multipliers is presented based on a novel cell replacement transformation. This transformation permits bit-level pipelining of the digit-serial multipliers thereby achieving sample speeds close to corresponding bit-parallel multipliers with significantly lower area. This increased sample speed can be traded with reduction in power supply voltage resulting in significant reduction in power consumption. The results show that for smaller digit-sizes (/spl les/4), the type-II multiplier consumes the least power and for larger digit-sizes, the type-I multiplier consumes the least power. It is also found that the optimum digit-size for least power consumption in type-I and type-III multipliers is /spl sim//spl radic/2W, where W represents the word length. The proposed digit-serial multipliers consume on an average 1.75 times lower power than the traditional digit-serial architectures for the non-pipelined case, and about 15 times lower power for the bit-level pipelined case.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.621599","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13529/00621599.pdf","startPage":"2164","endPage":"2167 vol.3","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.621599","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13529","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-power digit-serial multipliers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=621599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/621599/","displayDocTitle":"Low-power digit-serial multipliers","volume":"3","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5745195","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-power digit-serial multipliers","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00621599.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035187S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13529","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"3","articleId":"621599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":621681,"authors":[{"name":"R.

High frequency operation of the devices has been experimentally verified up to the MHz range and extrapolated to GHz by using the control input gate coupled in a coplanar configuration to the vortex flow SQUID array, while reasonable values of transresistance, bandwidth and dynamical range are observed. Influence of the damping on the JVFT performances has been also studies experimentally by varying the subgap resistance of the Nb tunnel junctions.

The program is a general purpose superconductor circuit simulator with an emphasis on the design of Rapid Single-Flux-Quantum (RSFQ) circuits. In the intervening years a number of new features were gradually added to the program. In particular, verification of the correct circuit behavior was enhanced using a special hierarchical Single-Flux-Quantum Hardware Description Language (SFQHDL). Next, a fast heuristic algorithm for margin optimization was introduced, which increased the number of parameters that can be simultaneously optimized in reasonable CPU times. Finally, recently we improved the numerical algorithm used for the simulation by using sparse symmetric positive definite matrices (instead of general structure band matrices as before). As a result, simulation speed has increased almost tenfold.

The alternative, known from semiconductor digital circuit design, is simulating at the logic (gate) instead of the circuit (transistor or junction) level. Using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog, it is possible to write functional model of each of the RSFQ basic gates. A large RSFQ circuit composed of hundreds gates and thousands Josephson junctions can then be simulated using standard semiconductor industry CAD tools. We have developed a library of Verilog models for over 15 basic RSFQ gates. We describe in detail our model for the DRO RSFQ cell.

High resolution A/D converters and other high speed signal processing systems have been demonstrated with junction counts well into the 10/sup 3/ range. Such large circuits require special testing techniques to prevent flux trapping within the gates, which can reduce bias margins and cause malfunctions of these devices. We discuss the results of experiments using single flux quantum shift registers in which we have varied the ground plane hole pattern and magnetic shield degaussing procedure to minimize flux trapping in these circuits. The operating bias margins of the shift registers have been measured as a function of different testing procedures and ground plane hole designs. In situ degaussing of the magnetic shields aids in the reduction of flux trapping and gave the best results.

Both algorithms compute the nodal motions in a hierarchical manner. Within each hierarchy level, the first algorithm (HMMA) minimizes the prediction error in the four elements surrounding each node, where the prediction is accomplished by a bilinear mapping. The optimal solution is obtained by a full search within a range defined by the topology of the mesh. The second algorithm (HBMA) minimizes the error in a block surrounding each node, assuming the motion in the block is constant. The two algorithms are compared with an exhaustive block matching algorithm (EBMA) by evaluating their performances in temporal prediction and in an H.263/TMN4 coder. In terms of the PSNR measure, the three algorithms achieve quite similar performances. However, HMMA and HBMA avoid blocking artifacts introduced by EBMA.

Our procedure is of coarse-to-fine type and consists of two passes. A first rough estimate of the rotational angle is computed by means of a phase correlation type algorithm applied to the radial projections of the Fourier transforms magnitudes of the two images. This estimate is then refined by computing, at higher resolution, the angular shift between the highest maxima of the radial projections after back rotating the second image according to the first rough estimate of the rotational angle. The accuracy reached by the proposed algorithm is a few hundredths of degree over a range of 360/spl deg/ Experimental evidence of this accuracy is reported.","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.622023","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13523/00622023.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.622023","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13523","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1184 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High resolution estimation of planar rotations based on Fourier transform and radial projections","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622023","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High resolution estimation of planar rotations based on Fourier transform and radial projections","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622023/","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5738907","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High resolution estimation of planar rotations based on Fourier transform and radial projections","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00622023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04136S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"7","articleId":"622023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":622035,"authors":[{"name":"Kai-Keung Chan","affiliation":["Dept. of Electr. & Electron.

The gradiometer was integrated on a single 3/spl times/3 mm/sup 2/ Si chip. To reduce the standoff distance between the specimen and the pick-up coil, a cryostat with a thin bottom space was developed. A scanning stage was made of nonmagnetic materials and was driven by air pressure using a rod-less cylinder to avoid making magnetic noise.","doi":"10.1109/77.622049","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/77.622049","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13488","startPage":"3271","endPage":"3274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfPath":"/iel4/77/13488/00622049.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622049","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spatial resolution","SQUIDs","Magnetic flux","Coils","Magnetic materials","Magnetic noise","Magnetic fields","Niobium","Control systems","Magnetic sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nondestructive testing","SQUID magnetometers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scanning DC-SQUID","spatial resolution","NDE","Nb/AlOx/Nb Josephson junction","cryostat","concentric multiloop gradiometer","computer","Nb-AlO-Nb"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Scanning DC-SQUID system with high spatial resolution for NDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"7","issue":"2","publicationDate":"June 1997","accessionNumber":"5707522","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"June  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622049/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scanning DC-SQUID system with high spatial resolution for NDE","sourcePdf":"00622049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031908S","chronDate":"June  1997","isNumber":"13488","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"77","citationCount":"13","articleId":"622049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":622052,"authors":[{"name":"Chok-Kwan Cheung","affiliation":["CityU Image Processing Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Chok-Kwan Cheung","id":"37611130600"},{"name":"Lai-Man Po","affiliation":["CityU Image Processing Laboratory, Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Lai-Man Po","id":"37270836200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3583-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"622052","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":37},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distortion measurement","Motion estimation","Transform coding","Video sequences","Area measurement","Computational complexity","Video compression","Image coding","Image processing","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image matching","computational complexity","motion estimation","high definition television","video coding","teleconferencing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical block matching algorithm","partial distortion measure","hierarchical partial distortion search","computational complexity","decimated block","motion vector","MSE performance","HDTV","MPEG-2","motion estimation accuracy","video conferencing","H.263 encoding"]}],"abstract":"Most of the fast block matching algorithms reduce computation by matching only some of the locations inside the search area. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm-hierarchical partial distortion search (HPDS)-which reduces the computational complexity of each distortion measure instead of the number of searching locations by using partial distortion measure. The partial distortion is obtained by calculating the distortion between the decimated block of current frame and that of previous frame. The motion vector is found hierarchically by searching the candidate motion vectors found from previous level of search. Each higher level uses partial distortion functions with decreased ratio of decimation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can give 5 times speed up compared with full search while maintaining the MSE performance very close to full search. Moreover, the algorithm can achieve 12 times speed up when the MSE performance is kept close to that of three-step search. The proposed algorithm is suitable for applications such as HDTV and MPEG-2 where motion estimation accuracy is important. It is also suitable for real-time applications such as video conferencing and H.263 where encoding speed are critical.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hierarchical block matching algorithm using partial distortion measure","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","doi":"10.1109/ISCAS.1997.622052","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4816/13523/00622052.pdf","startPage":"1237","endPage":"1240 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISCAS.1997.622052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13523","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622052","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-12 June 1997","displayDocTitle":"A hierarchical block matching algorithm using partial distortion measure","conferenceDate":"12-12 June 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5738921","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hierarchical block matching algorithm using partial distortion measure","confLoc":"Hong Kong, China","sourcePdf":"00622052.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024286S","chronDate":"12-12 June 1997","isNumber":"13523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4816","citationCount":"6","articleId":"622052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":622058,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Therefore, any improvement in filter technology consistent with this requirement could enhance satellite's performance. To reduce the size, weight, and cost of the multiplexers without compromising performance, we introduce a new class of dual mode multilayer filters consisting of YBa/sub 2/Cu/sub 3/O/sub 7-/spl delta// and LaAlO/sub 3/ thin films. The multilayer configuration in C-band, for example, occupies only 1% of the volume of its dielectric resonator counterpart.

The same performance characteristics that made millimeter-wave frequencies attractive for military applications have fueled the current growth in the 23 GHz and 38 GHz frequency bands for wireless point-to-point communications. We, like other MMW component suppliers, have had to go through a paradigm shift in our approach to this market. The key focus here is on cost and schedule. Performance requirements are defined in terms of minimum specifications and the customer has little interest and motivation in higher price/cost for products that exceed required performance levels.

In this paper we have studied the performance of the \"North American Digital Cellular IS-95\" system proposed by QUALCOMM, under the influence of spurious signals using the new \"Circuit Envelope Simulator\" in HP-EESOF's Microwave Design System, MDS. The implemented functional blocks facilitate the generation of proper (noisy) CDMA (reverse and forward) signals, which are then used to program an arbitrary wave generator in order to create actual test signals. Additionally, these functional blocks can be replaced with equivalent circuits, consisting of passive and active elements, etc. For illustrative purposes, we discuss the application of these signals to two real amplifiers, one linear and one nonlinear. The measured results are critically compared with the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/WCC.1997.622253","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Wireless Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Wireless Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4903/13517/00622253.pdf","startPage":"84","endPage":"88","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCC.1997.622253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13517","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance testing of the North American CDMA system, using an envelope simulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622253","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622253/","displayDocTitle":"Performance testing of the North American CDMA system, using an envelope simulator","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5800836","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance testing of the North American CDMA system, using an envelope simulator","confLoc":"Boulder, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00622253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026743S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4903","citationCount":"4","articleId":"622253","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":622254,"authors":[{"name":"R.

At the circuit level, the nonlinearity of a power amplifier is often given by the amplitude distortion (AM-AM) and phase distortion (AM-PM). When the amplifier input is undistorted, there is a simple relationship between the amplifier distortion and the error vector at the output: the error vector is the difference of the measured signal and a reference (ideal) signal, while the AM-AM and AM-PM are found from the ratio of the measured and reference signals. This relationship enables the EVM time series to be predicted from the AM-AM and AM-PM. In the frequency domain the spectral regrowth at the amplifier output is equal to a portion of the error vector power spectrum. A frequency-domain distortion power ratio may be estimated from the appropriate time-domain average of the EVM. These relationships are validated experimentally for a class AB amplifier and /spl pi//4 DQPSK signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5800839","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 1997","displayDocTitle":"The error vector and power amplifier distortion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The error vector and power amplifier distortion","confLoc":"Boulder, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00622256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027946S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4903","citationCount":"28","articleId":"622256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":622257,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A summary of the new efficiency characterization method is given, with two examples each for the IS-95 CDMA system and the AMPS system.","doi":"10.1109/WCC.1997.622258","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Wireless Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Wireless Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4903/13517/00622258.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCC.1997.622258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13517","startPage":"110","endPage":"113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical characterization of RF power amplifier efficiency for CDMA wireless communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622258","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Statistical characterization of RF power amplifier efficiency for CDMA wireless communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622258/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5800841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical characterization of RF power amplifier efficiency for CDMA wireless communication systems","confLoc":"Boulder, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00622258.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026857S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4903","citationCount":"51","articleId":"622258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":622260,"authors":[{"name":"Hsin-Chin Chang","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Hsin-Chin Chang","id":"37616371900"},{"name":"Seng-Woon Chen","affiliation":["Qualcomm, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Seng-Woon Chen","id":"38179944800"},{"name":"D.

This technique relies on representing the power amplifier as a bandpass nonlinearity described by a series expansion of in-phase and quadrature-phase gain transfer functions. It is shown that the order of the series expansion, as well as the selected series basis functions, have a direct influence on model accuracy. Additionally, this method is extended to predict amplifier drain current and efficiency when driven by time varying non-constant (envelope) amplitude signals, e.g., two tone sinusoids and digitally modulated signals. The effects of sub-harmonic frequency terminations occurring near the zeroth spectral zone, such as those due to bias decoupling on the device's drain terminal, are also examined. Generally, they are not considered in deriving the nonlinear transfer functions, and under certain circumstances, exhibit deleterious effects not predicted by this analysis technique.","doi":"10.1109/WCC.1997.622261","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Wireless Communications Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Wireless Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4903/13517/00622261.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCC.1997.622261","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13517","startPage":"121","endPage":"125","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The importance of sub-harmonic frequency terminations in modeling spectral regrowth from CW am-am and am-pm derived non-linearities","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622261","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The importance of sub-harmonic frequency terminations in modeling spectral regrowth from CW am-am and am-pm derived non-linearities","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622261/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5800844","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The importance of sub-harmonic frequency terminations in modeling spectral regrowth from CW am-am and am-pm derived non-linearities","confLoc":"Boulder, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00622261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048589S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4903","citationCount":"5","articleId":"622261","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":622265,"authors":[{"name":"U.

A fully 3D propagation model is considered. The topographical input data are based on a 3D plane-facets model of the urban environment which is given in terms of DXF files. FASPRO is able to read DXF files from AUTOCAD, Microsystem, CADDS and other CAGD and topographical tools. In addition, FASPRO has its own facility which allows it to create new urban scenes. FASPRO visualizes the geometry on the screen as a 2D map of the urban scene or a 3D isoparametric view. The electromagnetic analysis is performed using UTD techniques. First order coupling mechanisms (direct reflected and edge-diffracted rays), second order coupling mechanisms (double reflected diffracted-reflected, diffracted-reflected, double diffracted, etc.) and third order mechanisms (e.g. reflected-diffracted-reflected, etc.) are included. It must be noted that, thanks to the incorporation of diffraction in all the edges of the 3D model, coverage in areas in the deep shadow of the transmitter antenna can be predicted well. A new ray-tracing algorithm is used to speed-up the computations. This ray-tracing algorithm is based on a modification of the Z-Buffer and the \"Bounding Volumes\" schemes, in which the elements are arranged in an angular map (AZB, Angular Z-Buffer).","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Wireless Communications Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4903/13517/00622286.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"245","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1997 Wireless Communications Conference","doi":"10.1109/WCC.1997.622286","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCC.1997.622286","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13517","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622286","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast computer tool for the analysis of propagation in urban cells","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic diffraction","Layout","Ray tracing","Performance analysis","Microcell networks","Design automation","Visualization","Geometry","Electromagnetic analysis","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio","radiowave propagation","cellular radio","software tools","telecommunication computing","ray tracing","geometrical theory of diffraction","electromagnetic wave reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast computer tool","propagation analysis","urban cells","FASPRO","deterministic analyses","urban picocells","urban microcells","3D propagation model","topographical input data","3D plane-facets model","urban environment","DXF files","AUTOCAD","Microsystem","CADDS","topographical tools","CAGD tool","2D map","urban scene","3D isoparametric view","electromagnetic analysis","bounding volumes","UTD techniques","coupling mechanisms","ray tracing algorithm","Z-Buffer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fast computer tool for the analysis of propagation in urban cells","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5800869","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast computer tool for the analysis of propagation in urban cells","confLoc":"Boulder, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00622286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035823S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13517","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4903","citationCount":"35","articleId":"622286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":622339,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Adequately learning such long-term information can be useful in many problems in signal processing, control and prediction. A class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), NARX neural networks, were shown to perform much better than other recurrent neural networks when learning simple long-term dependency problems. The intuitive explanation is that the output memories of a NARX network can be manifested as jump-ahead connections in the time-unfolded network. Here we show that similar improvements in learning long-term dependencies can be achieved with other classes of recurrent neural network architectures simply by increasing the order of the embedded memory. Experiments with locally recurrent networks, and NARX (output feedback) networks show that all of these classes of network architectures can have a significant improvement on learning long-term dependencies as the orders of embedded memory are increased, other things be held constant. These results can be important to a user comfortable with a specific recurrent neural network architecture because simply increasing the embedding memory order of that architecture will make it more robust to the problem of long-term dependency learning.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622381/","accessionNumber":"5739830","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Remembering the past: the role of embedded memory in recurrent neural network architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Remembering the past: the role of embedded memory in recurrent neural network architectures","confLoc":"Amelia Island, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00622381.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055292S","chronDate":"24-26 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4900","citationCount":"2","articleId":"622381","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":622382,"authors":[{"name":"A.D.

This neural network effectively partitions the feature space into subregions and each terminal subregion is assigned to a class label depending on the data routed to it. As the tree grows, the number of training data for each node decreases, which results in less weight update epochs and decreases the time consumption. The MMPT performance is compared to that of a multilayered perceptron (MLP). The networks are applied to brain MR image segmentation into gray matter/white matter regions.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1997.622398","startPage":"189","endPage":"198","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing VII.

To design the globally optimal recognizer, all the HMMs must be jointly optimized to minimize the number of mis-classified training patterns. This is a difficult design problem which we attack using the technique of deterministic annealing (DA). In the DA approach, we introduce randomness in the classification rule and minimize the expected mis-classification rate of the random classifier while controlling the level of randomness in its decision via a constraint on the Shannon entropy. The effective cost function is smooth and converges to the mis-classification cost at the limit of zero entropy (non-random classification rule). The DA approach can be implemented via an efficient forward-backward algorithm for recomputing the model parameters. This algorithm significantly outperforms the standard maximum likelihood algorithm for a moderate increase in design complexity.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1997.622407","publicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing VII.

This optimization problem is known to be challenging when the number of data points exceeds few thousands. In previous work done by us as well as by other researchers, the strategy used to solve the large scale QP problem takes advantage of the fact that the expected number of support vectors is small (<3,000). Therefore, the existing algorithms cannot deal with more than a few thousand support vectors. In this paper we present a decomposition algorithm that is guaranteed to solve the QP problem and that does not make assumptions on the expected number of support vectors. In order to present the feasibility of our approach we consider a foreign exchange rate time series database with 110,000 data points that generates 100,000 support vectors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622408/","chronOrPublicationDate":"24-26 Sep 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5739855","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"24-26 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"An improved training algorithm for support vector machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved training algorithm for support vector machines","confLoc":"Amelia Island, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00622408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02394S","chronDate":"24-26 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4900","citationCount":"427","articleId":"622408","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":622412,"authors":[{"name":"A.

While several algorithms have shown promise in these tasks, these techniques may fail to separate signal mixtures containing both sub- and super-Gaussian distributed sources. In this paper, we present a simple and efficient extension of a family of algorithms that enables the separation and deconvolution of mixtures of arbitrary non-Gaussian sources. Our technique monitors the statistics of each of the outputs of the separator using a rigorously-derived sufficient criterion for stability and then selects the appropriate nonlinearity for each channel such that local convergence conditions of the algorithm are satisfied. Extensive simulations show the validity and efficiency of our method to blindly extract mixtures of arbitrary-distributed source signals.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1997.622425","publicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing VII.

A modal neural network is an artificial neural network system which includes two levels of information processing. The first level is trained to store and retrieve some acoustic and visual patterns. The different states of this network, which represent the sound classes in a task of speech recognition, are called modes and are supposed to chaotically evolve when speech recognition is performed in adverse environments. The control of the chaotic behavior of the different modes constitutes the second level. An external signal, taken from a visual input such as the lip-opening parameters of the speaker is applied to stabilize an acoustic modal network of which the modes are moved from an initial position to a target position. The addressed task is the audio-visual recognition of the 10 French vowels, perturbed by some noises. The perceptual linear predictive analysis applied to the speech signal of the 10 vowels outputs some vectors formed by 5 spectral parameters. They are in turn fed into a modal neural network implemented as a feedforward network. When the noise level increases, the classes stored by the acoustic MNN exhibit a chaotic behavior which is stabilized by the signal given by the visual path. We show that in an uncooperative environment, a chaotic modal neural network stabilizes well.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1997.622443","startPage":"607","endPage":"616","publicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing VII.

The proposed system consists of two modules: first, a coarse classifier determines an input character to one of the pre-defined subclasses partitioned from a large character set, such as Chinese mixed with alphanumerics. Then a character recognizer determines the input image to its most matched reference character in the subclass. The proposed BDNN can be effectively applied to implement all these modules. It adopts a hierarchical network structures with nonlinear basis functions and a competitive credit-assignment scheme. Our prototype system demonstrates a successful utilization of BDNN to handwriting of Chinese and alphanumeric character recognition on both the public databases (HCCR/CCL for Chinese and CEDAR for the alphanumerics) and in house database (NCTU/NNL). Regarding the performance, experiments on three different databases all demonstrated high recognition (88/spl sim/92%) accuracies as well as low rejection/acceptance (6.7%) rates. As to the processing speed, the whole recognition process (including image preprocessing, feature extraction, and recognition) consumes approximately 0.27 second/character on a Pentium-90 based personal computer, without using hardware accelerator or co-processor.","doi":"10.1109/NNSP.1997.622445","startPage":"626","endPage":"635","displayPublicationTitle":"Neural Networks for Signal Processing VII.

With a single frontal facial image under semicontrolled lighting conditions, the system performs (i) image preprocessing and template extraction, (ii) template correlation with a database of 173 images, and (iii) postprocessing of correlation results to identify the user. System performance issues including image preprocessing, face recognition algorithm, software development, and VLSI hardware implementation are addressed. In particular, the parallel, fully pipelined VLSI image correlator is able to perform 340 Mop/second and achieve a speed up of 20 over optimized assembly code on a 80486/66DX2. The complete system is able to identify a user from a database of 173 images of 34 persons in approximately two to three seconds. While the recognition performance of the system is difficult to quantify simply, the system achieves a very conservative 88% recognition rate using cross-validation on the moderately varied database.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time face recognition system using custom VLSI hardware","publicationTitle":"1993 Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.1993.622458","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","pdfPath":"/iel2/4898/13502/00622458.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"66","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.1993.622458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622458","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"A real-time face recognition system using custom VLSI hardware","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972900","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time face recognition system using custom VLSI hardware","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00622458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037406S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"13502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4898","citationCount":"16","articleId":"622458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":622461,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A major obstacle to the use of parallel computers is the lack of a universally accepted metric to study the scalability of parallel algorithms and architectures. The authors apply different scalability measures to various 2-D FFT algorithms and target architectures and compare the expected performance to the measured results. A number of algorithms in computer vision and image processing exhibit regular communication patterns similar to the 2-D FFT. The authors can therefore extrapolate the observations to determine which aspects of these measures are relevant to the scalability analysis of other similar image processing algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating scalability of the 2-D FFT on parallel computers","publicationTitle":"1993 Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.1993.622464","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","pdfPath":"/iel2/4898/13502/00622464.pdf","startPage":"109","endPage":"116","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.1993.622464","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622464","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622464/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating scalability of the 2-D FFT on parallel computers","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972906","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating scalability of the 2-D FFT on parallel computers","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00622464.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033855S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"13502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4898","citationCount":"4","articleId":"622464","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":622475,"authors":[{"name":"K.M.

This approach, which has been developed primarily for VLSI implementation, requires only the sign of spatiotemporal derivatives, 1-b Boolean multiplication and integer arithmetic to compute image velocity. Hence, it can be easily and efficiently implemented in hardware and software. It is composed of a hybrid of the Reichardt and Ullman-Marr motion models and measures both speed and direction at every pixel. For image sequences, it measures the number of frames required for an edge to translate over a pixel, while in analog hardware, it measures the time. Direction is given by correlating the disappearance of an edge at one pixel with its reappearance at a neighboring pixel. A test chip of this scheme has been implemented in 2 /spl mu/m VLSI and was found to measure 2-D velocity over three orders of magnitude. A total of 0.1 mW of power was consumed per pixel in room light. Therefore, this technique offers simple, computationally efficient, and direct means for measuring wide spatiotemporal bandwidth image motion in both hardware and software.","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.1993.622478","publicationTitle":"1993 Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","pdfPath":"/iel2/4898/13502/00622478.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.1993.622478","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new temporal domain optical flow measurement technique for focal plane VLSI implementation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622478/","displayDocTitle":"A new temporal domain optical flow measurement technique for focal plane VLSI implementation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4972920","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new temporal domain optical flow measurement technique for focal plane VLSI implementation","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00622478.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060981S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"13502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4898","citationCount":"17","articleId":"622478","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":622483,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

The primary reasons for this restriction are the uniformity of computation within the selected application and the availability of machines on which to perform the research. But, restriction one is artificial in that a multitude of applications exist that require nonuniform processing. The computer vision community provides an abundance of nice examples. Furthermore, with the current onslaught of building block components and architectures, restriction two is slowly being pushed aside. The authors describe an approach to analyzing an application with the goal of specifying an appropriate parallel processor architecture that will facilitate efficient application development (hardware and software), execution, and maintenance. Various typical computer vision tasks to illustrate the techniques are also discussed.","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","pdfPath":"/iel2/4898/13502/00622484.pdf","startPage":"293","endPage":"301","publicationTitle":"1993 Computer Architectures for Machine Perception","doi":"10.1109/CAMP.1993.622484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAMP.1993.622484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13502","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Specifying heterogeneous suites for vision tasks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer vision","Computer architecture","Application software","Image edge detection","Intelligent robots","Image motion analysis","Parallel robots","Intelligent systems","Parallel processing","Availability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous suite specification","vision tasks","parallel processing research","nonuniform processing","computer vision","building block components","architectures","parallel processor architecture","application development","hardware","software","execution","maintenance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Specifying heterogeneous suites for vision tasks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4972926","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"15-17 Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Specifying heterogeneous suites for vision tasks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00622484.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031298S","chronDate":"15-17 Dec 1993","isNumber":"13502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4898","citationCount":"52","articleId":"622484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":622492,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The implementation of the DWTs on these architectures are analyzed. Then, their performance are shown to be optimal or near-optimal, and compare favorably with other related parallel architectures.

One technique for accessing the huge bandwidth available in an optical fiber is wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM). Under WDM, the optical fiber bandwidth is divided into a number of nonoverlapping wavelength bands, each of which may be accessed at peak electronic rates by an end user. By utilizing WDM in optical networks, we can achieve link capacities on the order of 50 THz. The success of WDM networks depends heavily on the available optical device technology. This paper is intended as a tutorial on some of the optical device issues in WDM networks. It discusses the basic principles of optical transmission in fiber and reviews the current state of the art in optical device technology. It introduces some of the basic components in WDM networks, discusses various implementations of these components, and provides insights into their capabilities and limitations. Then, this paper demonstrates how various optical components can be incorporated into WDM optical networks for both local and wide-area applications. Finally, the paper provides a brief review of experimental WDM networks that have been implemented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622506/","volume":"85","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"5707705","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optical components for WDM lightwave networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical components for WDM lightwave networks","sourcePdf":"00622506.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068854S","chronDate":"Aug.  1997","isNumber":"13533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"107","articleId":"622506","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":622507,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Since Ti is not a hydrogen catalyst, the resulting hydrogen sensitivity indicates that a catalytic reaction between the gate metal and hydrogen gas is not required to have a detrimental hydrogen effect.

This paper presents a novel speech analysis/synthesis system based on the combination of an overlap-add sinusoidal model with an analysis-by-synthesis technique to determine the model parameters. It describes this analysis procedure in detail, and introduces an equivalent frequency-domain algorithm that takes advantage of the computational efficiency of the fast Fourier transform (FFT). In addition, a refined overlap-add sinusoidal model capable of shape-invariant speech modification is derived, and a pitch-scale modification algorithm is defined that preserves speech bandwidth and eliminates noise migration effects. Analysis-by-synthesis achieves very high synthetic speech quality by accurately estimating the component frequencies, eliminating sidelobe interference effects, and effectively dealing with nonstationary speech events. The refined overlap-add synthesis model correlates well with analysis-by-synthesis, and modifies speech without objectionable artifacts by explicitly controlling shape invariance and phase coherence. The proposed analysis-by-synthesis/overlap-add (ABS/OLA) system allows for both fixed and time-varying time-, frequency-, and pitch-scale modifications, and computational shortcuts using the FFT algorithm make its implementation feasible using currently available hardware.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5689531","volume":"5","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Speech analysis/synthesis and modification using an analysis-by-synthesis/overlap-add sinusoidal model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech analysis/synthesis and modification using an analysis-by-synthesis/overlap-add sinusoidal model","sourcePdf":"00622558.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048408S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"135","articleId":"622558","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":622561,"authors":[{"name":"D.P.

The proposed harmonic enhancement and suppression (HES) system is based on a frame-by-frame speaker separation algorithm that exploits the pitch estimate of the stronger talker derived from the cochannel signal. The idea behind this approach is to recover the stronger talker's speech by enhancing their harmonic frequencies and formants given a multiresolution pitch estimate. The weaker talker's speech is obtained from the residual signal created when the harmonics and formants of the stronger talker are suppressed. An automatic speaker assignment algorithm is used to place recovered frames from the target and interfering talkers in separate channels. Automatic speaker assignment performs reasonably well in most cochannel environments, including voiced-on-voiced, voiced-on-unvoiced, unvoiced-on-unvoiced, assignment after processing silence intervals, and single talker speech (no cochannel interference). The HES system has been tested at target-to-interferer ratios (TIRs) from -18 to 18 dB with widely available data bases. It has demonstrated improved performance in keyword spotting tests for TIR values of 6, 12, and 18 dB, and in human listening tests for TIR values of -6 and -18 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622561/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5689532","volume":"5","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cochannel speaker separation by harmonic enhancement and suppression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cochannel speaker separation by harmonic enhancement and suppression","sourcePdf":"00622561.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040348S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"38","articleId":"622561","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":622565,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Our objective is to enhance near-field speech signals by reducing multipath and reverberation. In real applications such as speech acquisition in acoustic environments, sources do not propagate along known and direct paths. Particularly in hands-free telephony, we have to deal with undesired propagation phenomena such as reflections and reverberation. Prior methods developed adaptive microphone arrays for noise reduction after a time delay compensation of the direct path. This simple synchronization is insufficient to produce an acceptable speech quality, and makes adaptive beamforming unsuitable. We prove the identification of source-to-array impulse responses to be possible by subspace tracking. We consequently show the advantage of treating synchronization as a matched filtering step. Speech quality is indeed enhanced at the output by the suppression of reflections and reverberation (i.e., dereverberation), and efficient adaptive beamforming for noise reduction is applied without risk of signal cancellation. Evaluations confirm the performance achieved by the proposed algorithm under real conditions.","doi":"10.1109/89.622565","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/13532/00622565.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.622565","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13532","startPage":"425","endPage":"437","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A signal subspace tracking algorithm for microphone array processing of speech","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622565","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A signal subspace tracking algorithm for microphone array processing of speech","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622565/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"5","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5689533","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signal subspace tracking algorithm for microphone array processing of speech","sourcePdf":"00622565.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034343S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13532","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"103","articleId":"622565","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":622569,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Efficiency benchmarks show that this boundary movement method is practical in 2-D, and competitive for larger scale or 3-D modeling applications.","doi":"10.1109/16.622591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13531","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.622591","endPage":"1385","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/13531/00622591.pdf","startPage":"1375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust, stable, and accurate boundary movement for physical etching and deposition simulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622591/","displayDocTitle":"Robust, stable, and accurate boundary movement for physical etching and deposition simulation","volume":"44","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"5693575","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust, stable, and accurate boundary movement for physical etching and deposition simulation","sourcePdf":"00622591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069092S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13531","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"27","articleId":"622591","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":622594,"authors":[{"name":"Jingkuang Chen","affiliation":["Center for Integrated Sensors and Circuits, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","Xerox J.

The nozzles are fabricated using a bulk anisotropic etching technology to undercut a network of highly-boron-doped silicon support ribs, forming an array of microchannels which are then sealed using thermal oxidation and LPCVD dielectrics. Closely-spaced trapezoidal or triangular nozzles are realized after cutting the wafer perpendicular to the microtubes. With a 21-/spl mu/m nozzle width and a 4-/spl mu/m nozzle-to-nozzle separation, a resolution of 1016 dots per inch (d/in) can be achieved. Polysilicon heaters are integrated on top of each microchannel so that when activated, the underlying ink is vaporized and a drop of ink is expelled to impinge on the paper. The fabrication of this device requires only five masks and is compatible with the addition of on-chip circuitry for multiplexing the heater control signals. Heat transfer efficiency to the ink is enhanced by the high thermal conductivity of the silicon ribs in the channel ceiling, while the bulk silicon maintains high interchannel isolation. Current pulses 20 /spl mu/s wide with a power density of 3.35/spl times/10/sup 8/ W/m/sup 2/ have been used in initial printing tests, resulting in 20-/spl mu/m diameter ink dots on a piece of paper which was set 2 mm away from the nozzle.

In the guideline, the recrystallization of the source/drain region gives inferior limits of the SOI thickness and the process temperature.

The results show that this model agrees well with the microscopic model provided carrier depletion is the dominant saturation mechanism relative to the plasma heating. The effective Bloch equations provide an accurate and practical model for modeling amplifiers with pulses of duration greater than a few picoseconds. By capturing the large bandwidth and the carrier density dependence of the gain, it also provides a reliable model for studying the complex spatiotemporal multilongitudinal and transverse mode dynamics of a variety of wide-aperture high-power semiconductor lasers.

One of the critical aspects of a class of scheduling algorithms, called \"List Scheduling\", is how to decide which task is to be scheduled next. This is achieved by assigning priorities to the nodes or the edges of the input DAG, and thus the task with the highest priority will be scheduled next. This paper proposes a low complexity scheduling algorithm to improve the priority node selection criteria in list scheduling algorithms. The worst case performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed for general input DAGs. Also, the worst case performance and the optimality conditions are obtained for free structured input DAGs. The performance comparison study shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing scheduling algorithms especially for input DAGs with high communication overheads. The performance improvement over existing algorithms becomes larger as the input DAG becomes more dense and the level of parallelism in the DAG is increased.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-15 Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622682/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5698600","conferenceDate":"11-15 Aug. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Decisive path scheduling: a new list scheduling method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decisive path scheduling: a new list scheduling method","confLoc":"Bloomington, IL, USA","sourcePdf":"00622682.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037076S","chronDate":"11-15 Aug 1997","isNumber":"13499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4895","citationCount":"7","articleId":"622682","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":622726,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Huaitie","affiliation":["Nat.

Currently, pneumatic cylinders are limited to a narrow range of applications because their motion trajectory is difficult to control. Conventional linear control methods can not compensate for both the nonlinear flow of compressed air and the internal friction present in the cylinders. Multilayer neural networks (MNNs) are nonlinear mappings which can be used to compensate for the nonlinear nature of these dynamic systems. A model of a pneumatic cylinder was developed to provide training data for a MNN. The MNN was designed to cancel the cylinder dynamics and was implemented as a feedforward controller in conjunction with a PID feedback controller. The MNN was trained over a range of constant velocity trajectories. The resultant controller allows the model to track the constant velocity training trajectories as well as trajectories for which the MNN was not trained.","doi":"10.1109/NAECON.1997.622728","startPage":"777","endPage":"784 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE 1997 National Aerospace and Electronics Conference.

The chip has been designed in 0.7 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, its architecture is pipeline and only the actives rules are processed. To do that the fuzzy system to be processed is first converted in an equivalent one where all the rules are present and then it is loaded in the chip memory. Because of the dimension of the chip rule memory it is possible to construct such a chip when the 4 inputs have no more than 7 Membership Functions, MFs, for each input and the overlapping of the input MFs is not higher than two. The design has been done in VHDL language and it has been synthesized by the Cadence Opus SW obtained via Europractice. This chip has been sent to the ES2 foundry last december to be constructed, we received it back at the end of February and recently it has been successfully rested. At the end of the paper the chip layout is described.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4864/13530/00622809.pdf","startPage":"779","endPage":"785 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1997.622809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1997.622809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13530","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI design and realisation of a 4 input high speed fuzzy processor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Pipelines","Fuzzy systems","Clocks","CMOS technology","Fuzzy logic","Input variables","Physics","Electronic mail","CMOS process"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","hardware description languages","inference mechanisms","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy systems","CMOS integrated circuits","microprocessor chips","fuzzy logic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI design","4 input high speed fuzzy processor","VLSI fuzzy chip","0.7 /spl mu/m CMOS technology","VHDL language","Cadence Opus SW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"VLSI design and realisation of a 4 input high speed fuzzy processor","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5697992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-5 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI design and realisation of a 4 input high speed fuzzy processor","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"00622809.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053524S","chronDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4864","citationCount":"5","articleId":"622809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":622840,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this kind of images, the authors have to deal mainly with 3 problems. First of all, there is a superposition of nuclear emission sources within the epicardium making difficult the separation of the 2 myocardial ventricles. Secondly, due to the great variety of ventricular forms, the process is hard to automate and, thus, human participation is required although it is time consuming. Third, the authors have to deal with noise and diffusion resulting from the nature of the technique itself. Their algorithm employs wavelets filters. To overcome the first and third difficulties. A neural network leader type algorithm, combined with a decision-based fuzzy logic system, enables the authors to segment the G-SPECT images and to recognize the left ventricle. This way, the endocardial contour is extracted and the second problem can be solved. Experimental results and a comparison with other methods, among them the one used in the authors' laboratory in clinical routine, show that the performance of the authors' algorithm is very high.","doi":"10.1109/FUZZY.1997.622840","startPage":"969","endPage":"974 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","pdfPath":"/iel3/4864/13530/00622840.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 6th International Fuzzy Systems Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FUZZY.1997.622840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Contouring blood pool myocardial gated SPECT images with a neural network leader segmentation and a decision-based fuzzy logic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Blood","Myocardium","Neural networks","Image segmentation","Fuzzy logic","Single photon emission computed tomography","Filters","Humans","Image recognition","Image analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["single photon emission computed tomography","blood","image segmentation","medical image processing","fuzzy logic","wavelet transforms","image recognition","cardiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood pool myocardial gated SPECT images","neural network leader segmentation","decision-based fuzzy logic","ventricular contours","nuclear emission sources","epicardium","noise","diffusion","wavelets filters","left ventricle","endocardial contour","nuclear medicine","medical diagnostic imaging"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Contouring blood pool myocardial gated SPECT images with a neural network leader segmentation and a decision-based fuzzy logic","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-5 July 1997","accessionNumber":"5698023","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Contouring blood pool myocardial gated SPECT images with a neural network leader segmentation and a decision-based fuzzy logic","confLoc":"Barcelona, Spain","sourcePdf":"00622840.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042508S","chronDate":"1-5 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4864","citationCount":"1","articleId":"622840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":622882,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

Proper choice of controller parameters (EWMA weights) is critical to the performance of this system. This work examines how different process factors affect the optimal controller parameters. We show that a function mapping from the disturbance state (magnitude of linear drift and random noise) of a given process to the corresponding optimal EWMA weights can be generated, and an artificial neural network (ANN) trained to learn the mapping. A self-tuning EWMA controller is proposed which dynamically updates its controller parameters by estimating the disturbance state and using the ANN function mapping to provide updates to the controller parameters. The result is an adaptive controller which eliminates the need for an experienced engineer to tune the controller, thereby allowing it to be more easily applied to semiconductor processes.","doi":"10.1109/3476.622882","startPage":"121","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part C","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Components, Packaging, and Manufacturing Technology: Part C","pdfPath":"/iel3/3476/13542/00622882.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3476.622882","endPage":"132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A self-tuning EWMA controller utilizing artificial neural network function approximation techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1997","displayDocTitle":"A self-tuning EWMA controller utilizing artificial neural network function approximation techniques","volume":"20","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5692938","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A self-tuning EWMA controller utilizing artificial neural network function approximation techniques","sourcePdf":"00622882.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035306S","chronDate":"Apr 1997","isNumber":"13542","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3476","citationCount":"38","articleId":"622882","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":622887,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Forced call terminations due to handoff call blocking are generally more objectionable than new call blocking. The previously proposed guard channel scheme for radio channel allocation in cellular networks reduces handoff call blocking probability substantially at the expense of slight increases in new call blocking probability by giving resource access priority to handoff calls over new calls in call admission control. While the effectiveness of a fixed number of guard channels has been demonstrated under stationary traffic conditions, with nonstationary call arrival rates in a practical system, the achieved handoff call blocking probability may deviate significantly from the desired objective. We propose a novel dynamic guard channel scheme which adapts the number of guard channels in each cell according to the current estimate of the handoff call arrival rate derived from the current number of ongoing calls in neighboring cells and the mobility pattern, so as to keep the handoff call blocking probability close to the targeted objective while constraining the new call blocking probability to be below a given level. The proposed scheme is applicable to channel allocation over cellular mobile networks, and is extended to bandwidth allocation over the backbone network to enable a unified approach to prioritized call admission control over the ATM-based PCN.","doi":"10.1109/49.622906","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/49/13557/00622906.pdf","startPage":"1208","endPage":"1225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.622906","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation for prioritized call admission over an ATM-based wireless PCN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622906","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622906/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation for prioritized call admission over an ATM-based wireless PCN","volume":"15","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5699923","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive resource allocation for prioritized call admission over an ATM-based wireless PCN","sourcePdf":"00622906.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040651S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"127","articleId":"622906","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":622908,"authors":[{"name":"M.M.

In the proposed network architecture, nodes are organized into nonoverlapping clusters. The clusters are independently controlled, and are dynamically reconfigured as the nodes move. This network architecture has three main advantages. First, it provides spatial reuse of the bandwidth due to node clustering. Second, bandwidth can be shared or reserved in a controlled fashion in each cluster. Finally, the cluster algorithm is robust in the face of topological changes caused by node motion, node failure, and node insertion/removal. Simulation shows that this architecture provides an efficient, stable infrastructure for the integration of different types of traffic in a dynamic radio network.","doi":"10.1109/49.622910","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","startPage":"1265","endPage":"1275","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/49/13557/00622910.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.622910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive clustering for mobile wireless networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless networks","Spread spectrum communication","Computer networks","Base stations","Mobile communication","Bandwidth","Robustness","Traffic control","Mobile computing","Multimedia systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication","land mobile radio","code division multiple access","personal communication networks","multimedia communication","network topology","adaptive systems","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive clustering","mobile wireless networks","self-organizing radio network","multihop mobile radio network","code-division multiple access","multimedia","network architecture","network nodes","nonoverlapping clusters","spatial bandwidth reuse","node clustering","bandwidth sharing","bandwidth reservation","robust cluster algorithm","node motion","node failure","node insertion","node removal","simulation","dynamic radio network","traffic integration","system performance","personal communications","mobile computing","transport protocol","routing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive clustering for mobile wireless networks","volume":"15","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5699927","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622910/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive clustering for mobile wireless networks","sourcePdf":"00622910.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035049S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"966","articleId":"622910","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":622911,"authors":[{"name":"B.H.

Three novel network configurations are proposed to overcome this limitation. Configurations I and II employ crosslinks to allow diversity combining of signals. This is accomplished in Configuration III by linking the modified MSCs serving adjacent cell clusters. In Configuration I, a scheme which reduces the handoff blocking probability by lengthening the handoff transition time is proposed. Configuration II expands overlapping regions of adjacent cell clusters, thus enabling the use of different intercluster handoff regions for different handoff directions to prevent oscillations which may occur in Configuration I, while reducing the necessary number of intercluster handoffs. Configuration III fully shares the trunks to support the highest number of calls among all three configurations. A new mobility model for microcells is developed to enable dimensioning of the trunk groups in each configuration. For Configurations I and II, the optimal partitions of trunk groups into direct and crosslinks are determined by mathematical analyses and computer simulations. For Configuration III, the optimal number of trunks required to interconnect adjacent MSCs is investigated by computer simulations. The new call and handoff blocking probabilities in all of these configurations are compared.","doi":"10.1109/49.622911","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/49/13557/00622911.pdf","startPage":"1276","endPage":"1288","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.622911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network configurations for seamless support of CDMA soft handoffs between cell clusters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622911","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622911/","displayDocTitle":"Network configurations for seamless support of CDMA soft handoffs between cell clusters","volume":"15","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5699928","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network configurations for seamless support of CDMA soft handoffs between cell clusters","sourcePdf":"00622911.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103385S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"12","articleId":"622911","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":622915,"authors":[{"name":"H.

For each frequency, the field solutions at different locations are processed by using the GPOF technique to extract two complex exponents that correspond to the forward and backward traveling waves, which provide all the information about the reflection coefficient and the dispersion characteristic of the transmission line. The advantage of combining the GPOF technique with the FDTD method is that the reflection coefficients can be obtained with a single run. Recognizing that there is a dearth of results for the reflection coefficients of slotline and CPW-line discontinuities with anisotropic substrates, the present problem is also solved by using the spectral-domain method for the purpose of validation, and the two results are found to compare quite well with each other. For further validation, the FDTD and GPOF solutions are derived for isotropic substrates, and are compared with the published theoretical and experimental results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An application of FDTD in studying the end effects of slotline and coplanar waveguide with anisotropic substrates","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.622939","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/13556/00622939.pdf","startPage":"1653","endPage":"1657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.622939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13556","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622939","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622939/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"An application of FDTD in studying the end effects of slotline and coplanar waveguide with anisotropic substrates","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5700704","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of FDTD in studying the end effects of slotline and coplanar waveguide with anisotropic substrates","sourcePdf":"00622939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041975S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"6","articleId":"622939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":622941,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Maximization of the coding gain has so far been viewed as a difficult nonlinear constrained optimization problem. It is shown that the coding gain depends only on the product filter P(z)=H(z)H(z/sup -1/), and this transformation leads to a stable class of linear optimization problems having finitely many variables and infinitely many constraints, termed linear semi-infinite programming (SIP) problems. The sought-for, original filter H(z) is obtained by deflation and spectral factorization of P(z). With the SIP formulation, every locally optimal solution is also globally optimal and can be computed using reliable numerical algorithms. The natural regularity properties inherent in the SIP formulation enhance the performance of these algorithms. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the SIP problem and its dual, characterize the optimal filters, and analyze uniqueness and sensitivity issues. All these properties are intimately related to those of the input signal and bring considerable insight into the nature of the adaptation process. We present discretization and cutting plane algorithms and apply both methods to several examples.","doi":"10.1109/78.622941","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13555/00622941.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.622941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","startPage":"2160","endPage":"2174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of linear semi-infinite programming in signal-adapted QMF bank design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622941","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"The role of linear semi-infinite programming in signal-adapted QMF bank design","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622941/","volume":"45","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5702348","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of linear semi-infinite programming in signal-adapted QMF bank design","sourcePdf":"00622941.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040837S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"63","articleId":"622941","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":622942,"authors":[{"name":"Trac Duy Tran","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Trac Duy Tran","id":"37286624300"},{"name":"T.Q.

This paper puts this choice back into question and solves the problem of minimizing the reconstruction distortion, which, in the most general case, is the sum of two terms: a first one due to the non-PR property of the FB and the other being due to signal quantization in the subbands. The resulting filter banks are called minimum mean square error (MMSE) filter banks. Several quantization noise models are considered. First, under the classical white noise assumption, the optimal positive bit rate allocation in any filter bank (possibly nonorthogonal) is expressed analytically, and an efficient optimization method of the MMSE filter banks is derived. Then, it is shown that while in a PR FB, the improvement brought by an accurate noise model over the classical white noise one is noticeable, it is not the case for the MMSE FB. The optimization of the synthesis filters is also performed for two measures of the bit rate: the classical one, which is defined for uniform scalar quantization, and the order-one entropy measure. Finally, the comparison of rate-distortion curves (where the distortion is minimized for a given bit rate budget) enables us to quantify the SNR improvement brought by MMSE solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13555/00622943.pdf","startPage":"2188","endPage":"2202","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.622943","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.622943","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13555","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perfect reconstruction versus MMSE filter banks in source coding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filter bank","Source coding","Quantization","Bit rate","White noise","Distortion measurement","Noise measurement","Mirrors","Mean square error methods","Optimization methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["source coding","transform coding","signal reconstruction","band-pass filters","filtering theory","quadrature mirror filters","rate distortion theory","quantisation (signal)","circuit optimisation","signal synthesis","entropy","white noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perfect reconstruction filter banks","MMSE filter banks","source coding","quadrature mirror filters","reconstruction distortion","signal quantization","nonperfect reconstruction property","quantization noise models","white noise","optimal positive bit rate allocation","efficient optimization method","synthesis filters","bit rate measures","uniform scalar quantization","order-one entropy measure","rate distortion curves","SNR","MMSE solutions","transform coding"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622943/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Perfect reconstruction versus MMSE filter banks in source coding","volume":"45","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5702349","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perfect reconstruction versus MMSE filter banks in source coding","sourcePdf":"00622943.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057789S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"29","articleId":"622943","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":622948,"authors":[{"name":"E.

In the context of channel diversity, we introduce the concept of mutually referenced equalizers (MREs) in which several filters are considered, the outputs of which act as training signals for each other. A corresponding (constrained) multidimensional mean-square error (MSE) cost function is derived, the minimization of which is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for equalization. The links with a standard linear prediction problem are demonstrated. The proposed technique exhibits properties of important practical concern: 1) the proposed algorithm is globally convergent. 2) Simple closed-form solutions exist for the MREs, but the MREs also lend themselves readily to adaptive implementation. In particular, the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm can be used to offer optimal convergence rate. 3) The MRE method provides a solution for all equalization delays, which results in robustness properties with respect to SNR and ill-defined channel lengths.","doi":"10.1109/78.622953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13555/00622953.pdf","startPage":"2307","endPage":"2317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.622953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line blind multichannel equalization based on mutually referenced filters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622953/","displayDocTitle":"On-line blind multichannel equalization based on mutually referenced filters","volume":"45","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5702356","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line blind multichannel equalization based on mutually referenced filters","sourcePdf":"00622953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054362S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"83","articleId":"622953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":622955,"authors":[{"name":"Chao-Tang Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Chao-Tang Yu","id":"37087186508"},{"name":"P.K.

Our approach for this design is based on the class of Ali-Silvey (see J. Royal Stat. Soc., Series B, vol.28, p.131-43, 1996) distance measures. Closed forms for the Bhattacharyya distance, the I-divergence, the J-divergence, and the Chernoff distance between the class conditional densities are obtained for the sampling design problem in the strong signal case. A new member of the class of Ali-Silvey distance measures that is suitable for the detection problem in the weak signal case is also derived. Sampling schemes are determined to maximize those four distance measures as well as the new distance measure for the strong signal case and the weak signal case, respectively. The detection performance of our sampling schemes is compared with those of various other sampling schemes by means of numerical examples. Comparisons show that the sampling design based on Ali-Silvey distance measures result in superior performance.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Signal sampling","Variable speed drives","Testing","Signal design","Signal processing","Signal detection","Degradation","Detectors","Chaos"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","signal detection","signal sampling","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian detection problems","sampling design","Gaussian hypothesis testing problems","closed forms","Bhattacharyya distance","I-divergence","J-divergence","Chernoff distance","class conditional densities","strong signal","Ali-Silvey distance measures","weak signal","sampling schemes","detection performance","signal reconstruction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/78.622955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/13555/00622955.pdf","startPage":"2328","endPage":"2337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.622955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling design for Gaussian detection problems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=622955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling design for Gaussian detection problems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622955/","volume":"45","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5707634","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling design for Gaussian detection problems","sourcePdf":"00622955.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045178S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"15","articleId":"622955","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":622957,"authors":[{"name":"P.

The first rule, called S, is derived under the assumption that the noise spatial covariance is block diagonal or banded. The assumption underlying the second detection rule, named T, is that the temporal correlation of the noise has a shorter length than that of the signals. In both cases, a matrix is built from the array output data covariances, the smallest eigenvalue of which is equal to zero under the hypothesis that the source number is overestimated. The sample distribution of the aforementioned smallest eigenvalue is derived and used to formulate the detection rules S and T. Both these rules are computationally quite simple. Additionally, they can be used with a noncalibrated array. The paper includes numerical examples that lend empirical support to the theoretical findings and illustrate the kind of performance that can be achieved by using the S and T detection rules.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622957/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","volume":"45","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"5702358","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Detection tests for array processing in unknown correlated noise fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection tests for array processing in unknown correlated noise fields","sourcePdf":"00622957.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040812S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"38","articleId":"622957","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":622959,"authors":[{"name":"Kuo-Liang Chung","affiliation":["Dept. of Inf.

A comparison of the open- and closed-loop responses of standard PWM techniques and that of the novel PWM technique shows that there has been a significant improvement in the control. A linear process model is obtained from experimental data using system identification. A proportional integral derivative controller with added friction compensation and position feedforward has been successfully implemented. A worst case steady-state accuracy of 0.21 mm was achieved with a rise time of 180 ms for step inputs from 0.11 to 64 mm. Following errors to 64-mm S-curve profiles were less than 2.0 mm. The controller is robust to a sixfold increase in the system mass.

This paper discusses the application of neural networks to control induction machines using direct torque control (DTC). A neural network is used to emulate the state selector of the DTC. The training algorithms used in this paper are the backpropagation, adaptive neuron model, extended Kalman filter, and the parallel recursive prediction error. Computer simulations of the motor and neural-network system using the four approaches are presented and compared. Discussions about the parallel recursive prediction error and the extended Kalman filter algorithms as the most promising training techniques is presented, giving their advantages and disadvantages.","doi":"10.1109/63.622996","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/13547/00622996.pdf","startPage":"788","endPage":"799","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.622996","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13547","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning techniques to train neural networks as a state selector for inverter-fed induction machines using direct torque control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/622996/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Learning techniques to train neural networks as a state selector for inverter-fed induction machines using direct torque control","volume":"12","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5694478","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning techniques to train neural networks as a state selector for inverter-fed induction machines using direct torque control","sourcePdf":"00622996.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053106S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13547","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"18","articleId":"622996","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":623001,"authors":[{"name":"M.

When the class-E rectifier controlled by this method is used in a class-E DC/DC power converter, both the inverter and rectifier operate under zero-voltage-switching conditions. Since the rectifier is controlled by a synchronized switch, it achieves the following advantages: (1) power efficiency for low-output voltage is improved; (2) output voltage and power are controllable at a fixed operating frequency; and (3) switching noise can be reduced. Additionally, this method is suitable for applications in which the output voltage or power are changed immediately because the output voltage and power are controlled by means of replacements of pulse patterns. The output characteristics of the rectifier are analyzed under a condition that the amplitude of the input current is constant.

Also, the size of the dump inductor is considerably reduced. The converters have simple control requirements, and allow the motor phase current to freewheel during chopping mode.

Three wrist position controllers were evaluated experimentally and in simulation. Closed-loop feedback regulation increased wrist stability in the presence of wrist moment disturbances, using less wrist muscle activation than an open-loop cocontraction system. However, if the disturbances were large compared to the available wrist muscle moment, controller saturation made the open-loop system more economical, even though the feedback controllers still performed better. The simulations also showed that stimulating the finger flexors can induce a negative stiffness: load at the wrist, which destabilizes wrist position. The destabilizing effects of the negative stiffness were reduced if the passive wrist moment model included nonlinear damping instead of linear damping.","doi":"10.1109/86.623016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Rehabilitation Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel4/86/13544/00623016.pdf","startPage":"244","endPage":"252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/86.623016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13544","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-loop wrist stabilization in C4 and C5 tetraplegia","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623016/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Closed-loop wrist stabilization in C4 and C5 tetraplegia","volume":"5","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5695898","pubMedId":"9292290","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-loop wrist stabilization in C4 and C5 tetraplegia","sourcePdf":"00623016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070223S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13544","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"30","articleId":"623016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":623019,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this method, the noise covariance matrix is estimated using a portion of the data that contains noise, but does not contain any signal information. Then, a modified noise subspace projector is formed using the generalized eigenvectors of the noise and measured-data covariance matrices. The MUSIC localizer is calculated using this noise subspace projector and the noise covariance matrix. The results from a computer simulation have verified the effectiveness of the method. The method was then applied to source estimation for auditory-evoked fields elicited by syllable speech sounds.

In order to perform texture characterization in such an application, only a few texture operators can be employed: the operators should be insensitive to noise and image distortion and yet be reliable in order to estimate texture quality from the small number of image points available. In order to describe the quality of infarcted myocardial tissue, the authors propose a new wavelet-based approach for analysis and classification of texture samples with small dimensions. The main idea of this method is to decompose the given image with a filter bank derived from an orthonormal wavelet basis and to form an image approximation with higher resolution. Texture energy measures calculated at each output of the filter bank as well as energies of synthesized images are used as texture features in a classification procedure. The authors propose an unsupervised classification technique based on a modified statistical t-test. The method is tested with clinical data, and the classification results obtained are very promising. The performance of the new method is compared with the performance of several other transform-based methods. The new algorithm has advantages in classification of small and noisy input samples, and it represents a step toward structural analysis of weak textures.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet image extension for analysis and classification of infarcted myocardial tissue","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.623055","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/13540/00623055.pdf","startPage":"856","endPage":"866","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.623055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623055","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623055/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet image extension for analysis and classification of infarcted myocardial tissue","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5681253","pubMedId":"9282478","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet image extension for analysis and classification of infarcted myocardial tissue","sourcePdf":"00623055.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062894S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"56","articleId":"623055","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":623056,"authors":[{"name":"B.D.

The spatial filters are implemented as a weighted sum of the data recorded at different sites. The weights are chosen to minimize the filter output power subject to a linear constraint. The linear constraint forces the filter to pass brain electrical activity from a specified location, while the power minimization attenuates activity originating at other locations. The estimated output power as a function of location is normalized by the estimated noise power as a function of location to obtain a neural activity index map. Locations of source activity correspond to maxima in the neural activity index map. The method does not require any prior assumptions about the number of active sources of their geometry because it exploits the spatial covariance of the source electrical activity. This paper presents a development and analysis of the method and explores its sensitivity to deviations between actual and assumed data models. The effect on the algorithm of covariance matrix estimation, correlation between sources, and choice of reference is discussed. Simulated and measured data is used to illustrate the efficacy of the approach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Localization of brain electrical activity via linearly constrained minimum variance spatial filtering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doi":"10.1109/10.623056","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/13540/00623056.pdf","startPage":"867","endPage":"880","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.623056","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13540","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623056","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623056/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Localization of brain electrical activity via linearly constrained minimum variance spatial filtering","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5681254","pubMedId":"9282479","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Localization of brain electrical activity via linearly constrained minimum variance spatial filtering","sourcePdf":"00623056.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048348S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"1492","articleId":"623056","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":623058,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Hen Hu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA"],"lastName":"Yu Hen Hu","id":"37277445900"},{"name":"S.

Tested with MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, the authors observe significant performance enhancement using this approach.","doi":"10.1109/10.623058","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/13540/00623058.pdf","startPage":"891","endPage":"900","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.623058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A patient-adaptable ECG beat classifier using a mixture of experts approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623058","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"A patient-adaptable ECG beat classifier using a mixture of experts approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623058/","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5681256","pubMedId":"9282481","volume":"44","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A patient-adaptable ECG beat classifier using a mixture of experts approach","sourcePdf":"00623058.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068518S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"373","articleId":"623058","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":623059,"authors":[{"name":"S.C.

This result extends a known one valid for the binary case to multilevel CPM. The proposed synchronization schemes do not require an increased number of matched filters, and are perfectly suitable to be used in conjunction with these receivers. Based on the phase-locked loop (PLL) equivalent linear model, a method for optimizing the parameters of digital second-order PLL's is presented.

However, the technique requires: (1) synchronization of the interference and the desired signal and (2) higher computational complexity than standard techniques.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/26/13551/00623073.pdf","startPage":"1088","endPage":"1094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.623073","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.623073","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13551","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trellis-coded cochannel interference canceller for microcellular radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interchannel interference","Interference cancellation","Ice","Fading","Maximum likelihood estimation","Computer simulation","Bit error rate","Computational complexity","Frequency","Diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","interference suppression","cochannel interference","trellis coded modulation","synchronisation","maximum likelihood estimation","estimation theory","Rician channels","fading","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trellis-coded cochannel interference canceller","trellis-coded modulation","microcellular radio systems","system capacity","maximum likelihood sequence estimation","desired signal","signal to interference ratio","computer simulation results","bit error rate reduction","Nakagami-Rice fading","average signal to interference ratio","synchronization","computational complexity","interference cancelling receiver","BER performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Trellis-coded cochannel interference canceller for microcellular radio","volume":"45","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712643","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trellis-coded cochannel interference canceller for microcellular radio","sourcePdf":"00623073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073929S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"59","articleId":"623073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":623075,"authors":[{"name":"H.V.

The NBI suppression performance of this method is then compared with performance bounds of the linear and nonlinear estimator-subtracter NBI suppression techniques.

An adaptive code-aided technique for the simultaneous suppression of narrow-band interference (NBI) and multiple-access interference (MAI) in direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (DS/CDMA) networks is proposed. This technique is based on the recursive least-squares (RLS) version of the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) algorithm for multiuser detection. The convergence dynamics of the RLS blind adaptive algorithm for suppressing the combined NBI and MAI are analyzed. The steady-state performance of this algorithm in terms of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is also derived. Systolic array structures for parallel implementations of the RLS adaptive interference suppression algorithms are then proposed. Versions of the rotation-based QR-RLS algorithms for both the blind adaptation mode and the decision-directed adaptation mode are derived. These algorithms exhibit high degrees of parallelism, and can be mapped to VLSI systolic arrays to exploit massively parallel signal processing computation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623076/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","volume":"45","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712646","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Code-aided interference suppression for DS/CDMA communications.

Strain is measured by a laser-based technique that enables direct and accurate recording of strain on a thin-film specimen. Load is recorded with a 1-lb load cell, and an air bearing is used to eliminate friction in the loading system. The specimen is phosphorus-doped polysilicon that has a gage cross section of 3.5 /spl mu/m thick by 600 /spl mu/m wide. All 29 uniaxial tensile tests show brittle behavior, and the average values of Young's modulus and fracture strength are measured to be 170/spl plusmn/6.7 GPa and 1.21/spl plusmn/0.16 GPa, respectively.

While microrelays have been introduced to MEMS on several occasions, all are based on solid-solid contacts, making them subject to contact wear, signal bounce, and general loss of performance with use. The goal of our device is to use mercury to eliminate the common problems of solid-contact switches. Descriptions of the design and fabrication of a micromechanical mercury-contact relay, including the technique for formation of microscale mercury droplets, are presented. The deionized (DI) water-filled microrelay has a mercury droplet, 5-25 /spl mu/m in diameter, placed near a disconnected set of electrodes in a V-groove throat. The throat connects two reservoirs containing suspended heaters. By turning on one heater, we grow a vapor bubble in one reservoir and induce a momentary water flow along the throat, forcing the mercury droplet to move and create the signal conduction path. Heating of the second reservoir can drive the mercury drop back to its original position. A microgasketing technique along with UV-curing epoxy sealing method is introduced to seal a chip containing many microdevices, each filled with liquid, at room temperature. Initial test results of the relay are also provided.","doi":"10.1109/84.623109","startPage":"208","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/84/13546/00623109.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/84.623109","endPage":"216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13546","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A liquid-filled microrelay with a moving mercury microdrop","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623109/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"A liquid-filled microrelay with a moving mercury microdrop","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5702385","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A liquid-filled microrelay with a moving mercury microdrop","sourcePdf":"00623109.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054252S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13546","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"61","articleId":"623109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":623118,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The mirror height is 75 /spl mu/m, covering the fiber core of a single-mode fiber when the latter is placed into a groove of equal depth and etched simultaneously with the mirror.

Using the buried oxide as a sacrificial layer allows to fabricate mirrors with suspension and actuation structures as well as fiber-alignment grooves in one and the same processing step. A minimal mirror thickness of 2.3 /spl mu/m was achieved, resulting in an aspect ratio higher than 30. The verticality was better than 89.3/spl deg/. In the upper part of the mirror a surface roughness below 40 nm rms was obtained. At a wavelength of 1300 nm the reflectivity of the aluminum-coated mirrors was measured to be higher than 76%. Using a reactive ion etched mirror we have fabricated an optical fiber switch with electrostatic actuation. The coupling loss in the bar state of two packaged prototypes was between 0.6 and 1.7 dB and between 1.4 and 3.4 dB in the cross state.

Under an assumption that the desired signal is large enough compared to each of interfering signals at the receiver, which is preconditionally achieved in code division multiple access (CDMA) mobile communications by the chip correlator, the proposed technique provides for a suboptimal beam pattern that increases the signal-to-noise/signal-to-interference ratio (SNR/SIR) and eventually increases the capacity of the communication channel. The main advantages of the new technique are: (1) the procedure requires neither reference signals nor a training period; (2) the signal intercoherency does not affect the performance or complexity of the entire procedure; and (3) the total amount of computation is tremendously reduced compared to that of most conventional beamforming techniques such that the suboptimal beam pattern is produced at every snapshot on a real-time basis. In fact, the total computational load for generating a new set of weights including the update of an N-by-N autocovariance matrix is O(3N/sup 2/+12N). It can further be reduced down to O(11N) by approximating the matrix with the instantaneous signal vector.","doi":"10.1109/8.623129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/13543/00623129.pdf","startPage":"1393","endPage":"1404","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.623129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of an adaptive antenna array for tracking the source of maximum power and its application to CDMA mobile communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623129/","displayDocTitle":"Design of an adaptive antenna array for tracking the source of maximum power and its application to CDMA mobile communications","volume":"45","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5687319","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of an adaptive antenna array for tracking the source of maximum power and its application to CDMA mobile communications","sourcePdf":"00623129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033591S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"84","articleId":"623129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":623133,"authors":[{"name":"Jo-Yu Wu","affiliation":["ElectroScience Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Jo-Yu Wu","id":"37350154000"},{"name":"R.

For all nodal elements as well as hexahedral edge elements, the phase error is always either positive or negative for waves propagating at any incidence angle, which means that the error accumulates as the wave propagates from element to element. This effect can produce large errors for electrically large geometries. On the other hand, the tetrahedral edge elements can produce either a negative or positive phase error, depending on the direction of propagation through the element. For an unstructured mesh, phase cancellation occurs since the orientation of the tetrahedral elements are arbitrary. Because of the cancellation, the numerical dispersion error is very low for meshes composed of well-shaped tetrahedral edge elements. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate this point.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The advantages of triangular and tetrahedral edge elements for electromagnetic modeling with the finite-element method","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.623133","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/13543/00623133.pdf","startPage":"1431","endPage":"1437","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.623133","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13543","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623133","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623133/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"The advantages of triangular and tetrahedral edge elements for electromagnetic modeling with the finite-element method","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"45","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5687323","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The advantages of triangular and tetrahedral edge elements for electromagnetic modeling with the finite-element method","sourcePdf":"00623133.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062161S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"25","articleId":"623133","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":623134,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Huge error propagation resulting from the use of long codewords is avoided by reversing the conventional hierarchy of the error control code and the constrained code. The new technique is exemplified by focusing on (d, k)-constrained codes. A storage-effective enumerative encoding scheme is proposed for translating user data into long dk sequences and vice versa. For dk runlength-limited codes, estimates are given of the relationship between coding efficiency versus encoder and decoder complexity. We show that for most common d, k values, a code rate of less than 0.5% below channel capacity can be obtained by using hardware mainly consisting of a ROM lookup table of size 1 kbyte. For selected values of d and k, the size of the lookup table is much smaller. The paper is concluded by an illustrative numerical example of a rate 256/466, (d=2, k=15) code, which provides a serviceable 10% increase in rate with respect to its traditional rate 1/2, (2, 7) counterpart.","doi":"10.1109/18.623139","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/13537/00623139.pdf","startPage":"1389","endPage":"1399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.623139","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13537","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A practical method for approaching the channel capacity of constrained channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"A practical method for approaching the channel capacity of constrained channels","volume":"43","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5681214","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623139/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A practical method for approaching the channel capacity of constrained channels","sourcePdf":"00623139.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024769S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"74","articleId":"623139","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":623140,"authors":[{"name":"C.P.M.J.

This scheme is based on approximate string matching, and it naturally extends the lossless Lempel-Ziv (1977) data compression scheme. Among others we consider the typical length of an approximately repeated pattern within the first n positions of a stationary mixing sequence where D percent of mismatches is allowed. We prove that there exists a constant r/sub 0/(D) such that the length of such an approximately repeated pattern converges in probability to 1/r/sub 0/(D) log n (pr.) but it almost surely oscillates between 1/r/sub -/spl infin//(D) log n and 2/r/sub 1/(D) log n, where r/sub -/spl infin//(D)>r/sub 0/(D)>r/sub 1/(D)/2 are some constants. These constants are natural generalizations of Renyi entropies to the lossy environment. More importantly, we show that the compression ratio of a lossy data compression scheme based on such an approximate pattern matching is asymptotically equal to r/sub 0/(D). We also establish the asymptotic behavior of the so-called approximate waiting time N/sub l/ which is defined as the time until a pattern of length C repeats approximately for the first time. We prove that log N/sub l//l/spl rarr/r/sub 0/(D) (pr.) as l/spl rarr//spl infin/. In general, r/sub 0/(D)>R(D) where R(D) is the rate distortion function. Thus for stationary mixing sequences we settle in the negative the problem investigated by Steinberg and Gutman by showing that a lossy extension of the Wyner-Ziv (1989) scheme cannot be optimal.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/13537/00623143.pdf","startPage":"1439","endPage":"1451","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.623143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.623143","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13537","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A suboptimal lossy data compression based on approximate pattern matching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern matching","Data compression","Entropy","Rate-distortion","Multimedia databases","HDTV","Algorithm design and analysis","Source coding","Multimedia computing","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","encoding","string matching","pattern matching","approximation theory","probability","entropy","rate distortion theory","sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["suboptimal lossy data compression","approximate pattern matching","variable source coding algorithm","suboptimal algorithm","approximate string matching","lossless Lempel-Ziv data compression","stationary mixing sequence","probability","Renyi entropies","lossy environment","compression ratio","asymptotic behavior","approximate waiting time","rate distortion function","stationary mixing sequences"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623143/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"A suboptimal lossy data compression based on approximate pattern matching","volume":"43","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5681217","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A suboptimal lossy data compression based on approximate pattern matching","sourcePdf":"00623143.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0364S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"64","articleId":"623143","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":623146,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Even in the most stringent case possible, the acceptance criterion is only a little more stringent than Forney's (1966) criterion for generalised minimum distance (GMD) decoding. We present simulation results on the error performance of our decoding algorithm for binary antipodal signals over an AWGN channel and a Rayleigh fading channel. The number of calculations of elements in a finite field that are required by our algorithm is only slightly greater than that required by hard-decision decoding, while the error performance is almost as good as that achieved with GMD decoding.

Thus if one could find an efficient (i.e., polynomial-time) algorithm for code equivalence, then one could settle the long-standing problem of determining whether there is an efficient algorithm for solving graph isomorphism.","doi":"10.1109/18.623157","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/13537/00623157.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.623157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13537","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Is code equivalence easy to decide?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Is code equivalence easy to decide?","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623157/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5687351","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Is code equivalence easy to decide?","sourcePdf":"00623157.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059206S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"40","articleId":"623157","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":623158,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.G.M.

For evaluating the error rate contributed by a component code, it is essential to calculate the corresponding spectrum of Euclidean distances. A method for computing this spectrum is developed in this correspondence. The method is general and applicable to any signal constellation, and convolutional as well as block component codes. The error coefficient, available in the literature for some multilevel codes with an infinite size signal constellation, is shown to be significantly different from that of a practical finite constellation.

The SLI is a partially separable grid structure that allows us to allocate more grid points to the regions where the function to be interpolated is more nonlinear. This approach reduces the mean squared error (MSE) between the original and approximated function while retaining much of the computational advantage of the conventional uniform grid interpolation. To obtain the optimal grid point placement for the SLI structure, we appeal to an asymptotic analysis similar to the asymptotic vector quantization (VQ) theory. In the asymptotic analysis, we assume that the number of interpolation grid points is large and the function to be interpolated is smooth. Closed form expressions for the MSE of the interpolation are obtained from the asymptotic analysis. These expressions are used to guide us in designing the optimal SLI structure. For cases where the assumptions underlying the asymptotic theory are not satisfied, we develop a postprocessing technique to improve the MSE performance of the SLI structure. The SLI technique is applied to the problem of color printer characterization where a highly nonlinear multidimensional function must be efficiently approximated. Our experimental results show that the appropriately designed SLI structure can greatly improve the MSE performance over the conventional uniform grid.","doi":"10.1109/83.623187","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/13539/00623187.pdf","startPage":"1231","endPage":"1245","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.623187","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13539","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequential linear interpolation of multidimensional functions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623187","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623187/","displayDocTitle":"Sequential linear interpolation of multidimensional functions","volume":"6","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5689291","pubMedId":"18283013","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequential linear interpolation of multidimensional functions","sourcePdf":"00623187.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048066S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"32","articleId":"623187","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":623189,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

It is well known that the parameters of an affine (bilinear or perspective) mapping can be uniquely estimated from three (four) point correspondences (at the vertices of a triangular or quadrilateral mesh element). On the other hand, overdetermined solutions using more than the required minimum number of point correspondences provide increased robustness against correspondence-estimation errors, however, this necessitates special consideration to preserve mesh-connectivity. This paper presents closed-form, overdetermined solutions for least squares estimation of affine motion parameters for a triangular mesh, which preserve mesh-connectivity using patch-based or node-based connectivity constraints. In particular, four new algorithms are presented: patch-constrained methods using point correspondences or spatio-temporal intensity gradients, and node-constrained methods using point correspondences or spatio-temporal intensity gradients. The methods using point correspondences can be viewed as postprocessing of a dense motion field for best representation in terms of a set of irregularly spaced samples. The methods that are based on spatio-temporal intensity gradients offer closed-form solutions for direct estimation of the best node-point motion vectors (equivalently the best transformation parameters). We show that the performance of the proposed closed-form solutions are comparable to those of the alternative search-based solutions at a fraction of the computational cost.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-form connectivity-preserving solutions for motion compensation using 2-D meshes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/83.623189","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/13539/00623189.pdf","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.623189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13539","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623189","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623189/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Closed-form connectivity-preserving solutions for motion compensation using 2-D meshes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5689293","pubMedId":"18283015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-form connectivity-preserving solutions for motion compensation using 2-D meshes","sourcePdf":"00623189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051457S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13539","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"51","articleId":"623189","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":623190,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

However, available 2-D mesh models, whether uniform or non-uniform, enforce connectivity everywhere within a frame, which is clearly not suitable across occlusion boundaries. To this effect, we hereby propose an occlusion-adaptive forward-tracking mesh model, where connectivity of the mesh elements (patches) across covered and uncovered region boundaries are broken. This is achieved by allowing no node points within the background to be covered (BTBC) and refining the mesh structure within the model failure (MF) region(s) at each frame. The proposed content-based mesh structure enables better rendition of the motion (compared to a uniform or a hierarchical mesh), while tracking is necessary to avoid transmission of all node locations at each frame.

Reconstructions based on this method is shown to be superior to conventional iterative reconstruction algorithms such as the multiplicate algebraic reconstruction technique (MART) and convolution from the point of view of accuracy of reconstruction.

Each class of networks is capable of representing the same set of languages, those embodied by the definite memory machines (DMMs), a subclass of finite-state machines. We demonstrate the close affinity between TDNNs and DMM languages by learning a very large DMM (2048 states) using only a few training examples. Even though both architectures are capable of representing the same class of languages, they have distinguishable learning biases. Intuition suggests that general TDNNs which include delays in hidden layers should perform well, compared to IDNNs, on problems in which the output can be expressed as a function on narrow input windows which repeat in time. On the other hand, these general TDNNs should perform poorly when the input windows are wide, or there is little repetition.

The main contribution of the reported work is the method for network weights calculation, in which the key idea is to transform the RBF kernels into an orthonormal set of functions (using the standard Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization). This significantly reduces the computing time if the RBF training scheme, which relies on adding one kernel hidden node at a time to improve network performance, is adopted. Another property of the method is that, after the RBF network weights are computed, the original network structure can be restored back. An additional strength of the method is the possibility to decompose the proposed computing task into a number of parallel subtasks so gaining further savings on computing time. Also, the proposed weight calculation technique has low storage requirements. These features make the method very attractive for hardware implementation. The paper presents a detailed derivation of the proposed network weights calculation procedure and demonstrates its validity for RBF network training on a number of data classification and function approximation problems.","doi":"10.1109/72.623218","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/13541/00623218.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.623218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"1177","endPage":"1183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel orthonormalization in radial basis function neural networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Kernel orthonormalization in radial basis function neural networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623218/","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5689042","pubMedId":"18255719","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel orthonormalization in radial basis function neural networks","sourcePdf":"00623218.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041134S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"78","articleId":"623218","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":623220,"authors":[{"name":"Yonggwan Won","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering and Computer Science, University of Missouri, Columbia, Columbia, MO, USA","Artificial Intellifence Section, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Yonggwan Won","id":"37087513865"},{"name":"P.D.

The feature extraction process is learned by interaction with the classification process. Feature extraction is performed using gray-scale hit-miss transforms that are independent of gray-level shifts. The morphological shared-weight neural network (MSNN) is applied to automatic target recognition. Two sets of images of outdoor scenes are considered. The first set consists of two subsets of infrared images of tracked vehicles. The goal in this set is to reject the background and to detect tracked vehicles. The second set consists of visible images of cars in a parking lot. The goal in this set is to detect the Chevrolet Blazers with various degrees of occlusion. A training method that is effective in reducing false alarms and a target aim point selection algorithm are introduced. The MSNN is compared to the standard shared-weight neural network. The MSNN trains relatively quickly and exhibits better generalization.","doi":"10.1109/72.623220","startPage":"1195","endPage":"1203","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/13541/00623220.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.623220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Morphological shared-weight networks with applications to automatic target recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Feature extraction","Target tracking","Vehicle detection","Morphology","Gray-scale","Target recognition","Layout","Infrared imaging","Vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","multilayer perceptrons","feature extraction","object recognition","mathematical morphology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["morphological shared-weight networks","neural network","automatic target recognition","mathematical morphology","feature extraction","gray-scale hit-miss transforms","infrared images","object recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623220/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Morphological shared-weight networks with applications to automatic target recognition","volume":"8","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5689044","pubMedId":"18255721","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Morphological shared-weight networks with applications to automatic target recognition","sourcePdf":"00623220.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068899S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13541","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"80","articleId":"623220","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":623224,"authors":[{"name":"Lipo Wang","affiliation":["School of Computing and Mathematics, Deakin University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"lastName":"Lipo Wang","id":"37087219415"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"623224","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":76,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623224","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Least squares approximation","Signal processing algorithms","Convergence","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Neural networks","Computer simulation","Gaussian distribution","Analytical models","Fluctuations","Filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","constraint handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["competitive learning","competitive neurons","training patterns","learning rules","weight normalization","length-constraint","sum-constraint","neural networks"]}],"abstract":"We derive learning rates such that all training patterns are equally important statistically and the learning outcome is independent of the order in which training patterns are presented, if the competitive neurons win the same sets of training patterns regardless the order of presentation.

Simple ridge waveguide devices were fabricated with 8/spl deg/ angled facets. The internal gain is 26.5 dB for both the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarizations at a wavelength of 1.55 \u03bcm and an injection current of 375 mA. The polarization sensitivity of the gain is less than 1 dB for a bandwidth of 45 nm, and the gain is nearly flat with a variation of less than 1 dB for a bandwidth of 20 nm.

The experimental results are shown to be in excellent agreement with a novel exact calculation of the optically preamplified receiver Q-PPM bit-error rate (BER). Calculated performance based on these results shows that with an improved optical transmitter the receiver attains 1.5 dB higher sensitivity than previously achieved at this wavelength.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical receivers","Optical sensors","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical filters","Optical transmitters","Stimulated emission","Optical saturation","Optical noise","Preamplifiers","Optical recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical receivers","quantum well lasers","pulse position modulation","satellite communication","sensitivity","high-speed optical techniques"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["semiconductor optically preamplified Q-PPM receiver","high-sensitivity","laser intersatellite communications","quaternary pulse-position-modulation","bit-error rate","performance calculation","InGaAs-GaAs SQW SCH laser","980 nm","50 Mbit/s","41 dB","993 nm","InGaAs-GaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/68.623274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/13559/00623274.pdf","startPage":"1394","endPage":"1396","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.623274","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-sensitivity semiconductor optically preamplified Q-PPM receiver","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-sensitivity semiconductor optically preamplified Q-PPM receiver","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623274/","volume":"9","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5707205","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-sensitivity semiconductor optically preamplified Q-PPM receiver","sourcePdf":"00623274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037571S","chronDate":"Oct.  1997","isNumber":"13559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","articleId":"623274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":623275,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The architecture utilizes a differential external integrated-optic modulator to electrooptically combine the base-band and subcarrier multiplexed data onto an optical carrier. An analytical model is presented that allows optimization of the SNR of the received base-band and control data channels based on modulation parameters. This optimization is based on tradeoffs that result when the base-band and subcarrier channel are combined using a nonlinear modulator transfer function. We experimentally demonstrate a link based on this architecture with 2.5-Gb/s base-band and 100-Mb/s control data multiplexed on a 5.5-GHz subcarrier. Analytical and measured experimental results are compared and are shown to be in good agreement.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/13559/00623275.pdf","startPage":"1397","endPage":"1399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","doi":"10.1109/68.623275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.623275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13559","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=623275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel transmitter architecture for combined baseband data and subcarrier-multiplexed control links using differential Mach-Zehnder external modulators","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Baseband","Optical transmitters","Optical modulation","Nonlinear optics","Optical filters","Transfer functions","Optical fiber communication","WDM networks","Arm","Voltage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical transmitters","optimisation","optical noise","subcarrier multiplexing","integrated optics","electro-optical modulation","optical fibre communication","optical transfer function","nonlinear optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmitter architecture","baseband data control links","subcarrier-multiplexed control links","differential Mach-Zehnder external modulators","differential external integrated-optic modulator","electrooptically","optical carrier","analytical model","optimization","SNR","modulation parameters","tradeoffs","nonlinear modulator transfer function","2.5 Gbit/s","100 Mbit/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1997","displayDocTitle":"A novel transmitter architecture for combined baseband data and subcarrier-multiplexed control links using differential Mach-Zehnder external modulators","volume":"9","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5707206","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel transmitter architecture for combined baseband data and subcarrier-multiplexed control links using differential Mach-Zehnder external modulators","sourcePdf":"00623275.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065322S","chronDate":"Oct.  1997","isNumber":"13559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"16","articleId":"623275","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":623276,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The algorithm utilizes the WTs flexibility in the time-frequency resolution to compute robust parameters for VAD decision. Furthermore, it exhibits a low complexity and can be easily adapted to operate as a pre-processor for many speech-coding algorithms. Two versions of the wavelet-transform-based VAD (WT-VAD) are tested against the VAD of the ITU-T G.729 Annex B (G729) and the VAD of the GSM enhanced full-rate codec (GSM), respectively. For a variety of background-noise types the WT-VAD shows superior noise robustness to signal-to-noise ratios above 10 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust voice-activity detection based on the wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Speech Coding for Telecommunications Proceedings.

The current design flows do not fully utilize the data-path and memory capabilities in the ORCA architecture. To fully utilize the capability of ORCA's flexible data-path blocks and to provide the designer with the flexibility of accessing the architectural features of ORCA, the tool SCUBA (Synthesis Compiler for User-programmaBle Arrays) was developed and integrated into the ORCA design flow. SCUBA synthesizes parametrized data-path and memory blocks in VHDL/Verilog/EDIF, which are optimized for the ORCA architecture. SCUBA can also provide optimal positional information to a placer. By preserving regularity information of a circuit network structure in a layout tool, the performance of the synthesized circuits improves substantially. SCUBA also provides a means for exploring future-generation architectures by providing interface blocks for designing complex structures, such as application-specific blocks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/623942/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22, Oct 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5761708","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 Oct. 1997","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"SCUBA: an HDL data-path/memory module generator for FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SCUBA: an HDL data-path/memory module generator for FPGAs","confLoc":"Arlington, VA, USA","sourcePdf":"00623942.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060493S","chronDate":"19-22, Oct 1997","isNumber":"13570","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4918","citationCount":"1","articleId":"623942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":623943,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The approach reduces the time it takes to implement changes in an FPGA design. It also helps designers stay connected with the implementation issues and helps new synthesis users get over the learning curve.

The algorithm is based on Baldwin's (1896) effect, with the inclusion of biological principles of learning. Rather than considering mutation as a stochastic event, we take into account the results of biological experiences that seem to indicate an individual capability to choose the best mutation. The proposed adaptive model consists of two levels: (a) an evolutionary or global level, which works on the generation of populations at the genetic code level; and (b) a learning or local level, which works during the lifetime of the agents, with the individuals reacting to environmental stimuli. The method has been applied in well-known learning problems, with strong supremacy over other hybrid genetic approaches, particularly in terms of the expressiveness of the learned fuzzy system.","doi":"10.1109/NAFIPS.1997.624079","startPage":"428","endPage":"433","publicationTitle":"1997 Annual Meeting of the North American Fuzzy Information Processing Society - NAFIPS (Cat.

The main points at these systems are the communication reliability and the hardware reliability. Usually the control or monitoring systems could operate at a very low data rate. Typically, these acoustic systems need to operate at horizontal distances ranging from 1 to 10 km and at water depths from 100 to 2000 m. To select suitable signaling techniques in these fading multipath channels, it is fundamental to evaluate the distortions introduced in the signal by the channel. Experimental results with some of these configurations, with evaluations of time spreading, frequency spreading, frequency and time coherence and statistical distribution of the fading are presented. The multipath configuration can be evaluated by ray-tracing software. The main difficulties to implement a simple FSK system, even with a low data rate, are the multipath. A modem that can overcome the multipath and intersymbolic interference is proposed; this modem uses a FSK modulation scheme with silence intervals (guard intervals). A special symbol synchronization system is also proposed, based on the use of Williard words. Experimental results with this modem at the Brazilian Campos Basin showed promising results.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.624105","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

The new system configuration shares the advantages of the correlating receiver of the direct sequence spread spectrum (DS-SS) system and COFDM modulation. A key feature of the new system is that a pseudo-random Gaussian noise (PRGN) signal can be used as a channel sounding probe for measuring the complex channel transfer function for the frequency domain signal equalization. The PRGN signal itself can be optimized to the available dynamic range of the transmitter DAC in order to provide the best peak-to-rms ratio (or equivalently, the crest factor). Because of the unique random phase sequence used for the optimization process, synchronization can be achieved by linear cross correlation between the received signal and a known replica phase sequence in the receiver. By virtue of the frequency domain equalization and maximum likelihood Viterbi decoding, the system is shown to have high stability and can operate with low BER at extremely low SNR conditions.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.624107","publicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

Despite their small size and low cost, these new vehicles are versatile, reliable and require only a two person support staff. These features make the vehicles affordable and available for use by a broad segment of the oceanographic community. The vehicle operators must be confident that they can cost effectively use these new tools with a minimum of support staff for missions such as coastal ocean surveys, and pollution identification and source tracking. An effort to design and fabricate a low cost, small, and accessible vehicle resulted in REMUS, Remote Environmental Measuring UnitS. The vehicle is 19 cm in diameter by 134 cm long and weighs 31 kg. It has an operating and control system based on the PC-104 form factor of the IBM-PC which can be connected to a laptop computer for system configuration. With 400 watt-hours of conventional lead acid batteries the vehicle has a useful range of 25 nautical miles at 3 knots, and a top speed of 5 knots. REMUS is capable of navigating itself using a variety of techniques including long and ultra-short baseline acoustic navigation, bottomlock Doppler navigation and GPS reception. The major system design features are described in this paper including the electrical power plant, the vehicle control system, the acoustic navigation system, and the user interface to the vehicle. The mechanical design and system performance are presented along with recent results from field tests of navigating the vehicle around a pair of transponders.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.624126","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1997.624126","startPage":"994","endPage":"1000 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

In practice, sensor noise can severely degrade algorithm performance by producing featural aliasing in the reconstructed (decompressed) imagery. This paper summarizes the latest research in low-distortion, high-rate image compression transforms for ATR applications that require image transmission along low-bandwidth channels such as UW acoustic uplinks. In particular, a novel transform called BLAST has been developed that can achieve compression ratios in the range 50:1<CR<280:1 on UW imagery at visually acceptable quality, via simple arithmetic operations over small local neighborhoods. Comparative analysis of performance among BLAST, pyramid coding (EPIC), and visual pattern image coding (VPIC) includes compression ratio, information loss, and computational efficiency measured over a large database of UW imagery. Information loss is discussed in terms of the modulation transfer function and several image quality measures. Parallel implementation of the BLAST, VPIC and EPIC transforms is discussed in terms of speed advantages and storage costs.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.624141","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

A number of homing technologies have been proposed and tested, with acoustic homing generally the most prevalent. Accurate acoustic homing requires systems with high update rates, and extensive signal conditioning if AUV orientation is required, as well as, bearing and distance to the dock. Vehicle orientation becomes increasingly important in the final stages of the docking, as large changes in orientation near the dock are impractical and often not possible. An electromagnetic (EM) homing system is one alternative that can provide accurate measurement of the AUV position and orientation to the dock during homing. This system offers inherent advantages in defining the AUV orientation, when compared to high frequency acoustic systems. The design and testing of an EM homing system is given, with particular attention to one can be adapted to a wide class of AUVs. The EM homing system consists of a dock with EM coils that provide the homing signal, and set of sensing coils that are mounted in the AUV. The present tests used the MIT Sea Grant Program Odyssey AUV as the test vehicle. A number of homing, docking and latching trials were successfully performed with the design. Homing data include dead reckoning computation and acoustic tracking of the homing track, and video documentation of homing into the dock.","doi":"10.1109/OCEANS.1997.624152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS.1997.624152","startPage":"1137","endPage":"1142 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Oceans '97.

To get a highly reliable product to the market on schedule, software engineers must allocate resources appropriately across the development effort. Software quality models based upon data drawn from past projects can identify key risk or problem areas in current similar development efforts. Knowing the high-risk modules in a software design is a key to good design and staffing decisions. A number of researchers have recognized this, and have applied modeling technqiues to isolate fault-prone or high-risk program modules early in the development cycle. Discriminant analytic classification models have shown promise in performing this task. We introduce a neural network classification model for identifying high-risk program modules, and we compare the quality of this model with that of a discriminant classification model fitted with the same data. We find that the neural network techniques provide a better management tool in software engineering environments.","doi":"10.1109/ISSRE.1993.624300","startPage":"302","endPage":"309","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/4910/13562/00624300.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSRE.1993.624300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network modeling methodology for the detection of high-risk programs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Profitability","Programming","Reliability engineering","Resource management","Software quality","Software design","Performance analysis","Environmental management","Engineering management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software reliability","resource allocation","software quality models","fault prone program modules","neural network modeling methodology","high-risk programs","profitability","software development","software design","staffing","high-risk program modules","analytic classification models","neural network classification model","discriminant classification model","management tool","software engineering environments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"A neural network modeling methodology for the detection of high-risk programs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4910390","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network modeling methodology for the detection of high-risk programs","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00624300.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036623S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov 1993","isNumber":"13562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4910","citationCount":"9","articleId":"624300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":624301,"authors":[{"name":"N.

However, this assumption is often violated in large software projects. Thus, the existing models may not be able to provide an accurate description of the failure process in the presence of code churn. Daal and McIntosh (1992) developed an extended stochastic model by incorporating continuous code churn into a standard Poisson process model and observed an improvement in the model's estimation accuracy. This paper demonstrates the applicability of the neural network approach to the problem of developing an extended software reliability growth model in the face of continuous code churn. In this preliminary study, a comparison is made between two neural network models, one with the code churn information and the other without the code churn information, for the accuracy of fit and the predictive quality using a data set from a large telecommunication system. The preliminary results suggest that the neural network model that incorporates the code churn information is capable of providing a more accurate prediction than the network without the code churn information.","doi":"10.1109/ISSRE.1993.624301","startPage":"310","endPage":"317","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel2/4910/13562/00624301.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1993 IEEE International Symposium on Software Reliability Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSRE.1993.624301","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach for software reliability growth modeling in the presence of code churn","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Software reliability","Intelligent networks","System testing","Software testing","Predictive models","Software systems","Reliability engineering","Time domain analysis","Stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software reliability growth models","testing","large software projects","failure process","code churn","extended stochastic model","continuous code churn","standard Poisson process model","estimation accuracy","neural network approach","accuracy of fit","predictive quality","large telecommunication system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach for software reliability growth modeling in the presence of code churn","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4910391","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach for software reliability growth modeling in the presence of code churn","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00624301.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028579S","chronDate":"3-6 Nov 1993","isNumber":"13562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4910","citationCount":"3","articleId":"624301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":624304,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

Instead, program instrumentation is used to solve a set of path constraints without explicitly knowing their form. The system supports not only the generation of integer and real data types, but also non-numerical discrete types such as characters and enumerated types.

In a packet communication system the correctness or incorrectness of the received blocks is usually strictly related to a comparison of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a set of thresholds. The possibility of fitting a Markovian model to the quantized fading process is investigated, assuming the states of the model are coincident with the quantization levels (symbols). The two-threshold case is considered and the suitability of a first-order Markov model or even a zero-order Markov model (that means independent and identically distributed symbols) in describing such a process is verified. For this purpose, the parameters of a second-order Markov model are estimated and the table of contingency analysis for Markov chains is applied. It is shown that, in the fast fading case, process symbols can be considered as independent and identically distributed, while in the slow fading case the first-order Markovian model only approximates the real behavior of the fading.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624354","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624354.pdf","startPage":"12","endPage":"16 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On verifying a first-order Markovian model for the multi-threshold success/failure process for Rayleigh channel","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","displayDocTitle":"On verifying a first-order Markovian model for the multi-threshold success/failure process for Rayleigh channel","isConference":true,"volume":"1","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855332","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624354/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On verifying a first-order Markovian model for the multi-threshold success/failure process for Rayleigh channel","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048749S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"6","articleId":"624354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":624355,"authors":[{"name":"M.

An analytical framework for the computation of various performance metrics is also presented. A Markov description is assumed for the channel, which allows closed-form solutions and can effectively model many situations of interest. Outage events are defined as being triggered by /spl tau//sub b/ consecutive channel errors, and being ended by /spl tau//sub g/ consecutive successes.

This paper presents a generic capacity analysis applied to a GSM-CDMA overlay. The effects of shadowing and imperfect implementation of sectorization, power control and notch filtering are modeled for both uplink and downlink. Based on maximum allowable levels of mutual interference, the total system capacity is modeled and evaluated. Under moderate shadowing and perfect implementation of sectorization, power control and notch filtering, the results match those obtained in previous analyses by other authors, i.e., a capacity gain factor between 3 and 4. However, for low GSM margins in addition to imperfect sectorization, power control and notch filtering, the capacity gain is shown to reduce significantly. Particularly under heavy shadowing conditions, the overlay does not lead to capacity gain. The propagation loss factor and notch filtering are shown to have a large influence on the results. Provided almost perfect notch filtering and power control, the downlink performs slightly better than the uplink.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624357","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624357.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624357","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","startPage":"27","endPage":"31 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of co-existent cellular CDMA and GSM with shadowing and imperfect sectorization, power control and notch filtering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624357","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of co-existent cellular CDMA and GSM with shadowing and imperfect sectorization, power control and notch filtering","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624357/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855335","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of co-existent cellular CDMA and GSM with shadowing and imperfect sectorization, power control and notch filtering","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624357.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032108S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"3","articleId":"624357","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":624359,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We show that linear interference cancellation schemes are asymptotically zero-forcing which means that they are equivalent to the decorrelating detector if the number of stages approaches infinity. These detectors have been found to be superior to the conventional matched filter detector. However, the design of spreading sequences optimized especially for these receivers has not been considered up to now. Usually, spreading sequences are designed to have a low peak correlation parameter. Pursley (1977) has shown that the average interference parameter (AIP) is an important design parameter since it is related to the average signal-to-interference ratio of the conventional receiver. In this paper, we consider the construction of spreading sequences for zero-forcing multiuser detectors that are optimal in the sense of performance and near-far resistance. It is shown that sequences with a low AIP are near-optimal. This, again, stresses the importance of the AIP for the design of spreading sequences for CDMA systems employing any kind of receiver. Numerical examples indicate that by using optimized sequences the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved by about 1-2 dB for lengths of interest in applications.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624362","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624362.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624362","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","startPage":"53","endPage":"57 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spreading sequences for zero-forcing DS-CDMA multiuser detectors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624362","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spreading sequences for zero-forcing DS-CDMA multiuser detectors","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624362/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855337","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spreading sequences for zero-forcing DS-CDMA multiuser detectors","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624362.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029504S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"11","articleId":"624362","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":624365,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaochun Li","affiliation":["New Jersey Institute of Technology Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Center for Communications and Signal Processing Research, University Heights, Newark, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaochun Li","id":"38272765700"},{"name":"Y.

Estimation and tracking errors of these delays cause errors in the correlation matrix as they all perceived by the receiver. Some linear detectors, like decorrelating detector, minimum mean-square error (MMSE) detector, or nonlinear detectors, such as zero-forcing decision-feedback (ZF-DF) detector, all directly perform some manipulation on the correlation matrix and hence they are very sensitive to delay shift or estimation error. The bootstrap detector, on the other hand, performs adaptive transformation on the output of the matched filter directly, taking into account any such errors if they exist. Therefore one may expect this detector to be more robust to delay errors. We analyse the bootstrap detector when delay errors exist. We examine analytically as well as by simulation, the BER obtained with this detector and compare it to the conventional decorrelating detector. We show that while the latter becomes non-near-far resistant when error exists, the bootstrap stays near-far resistant in the limit although with some degradation in performance when the condition number of the correlation matrix becomes large.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624365","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624365.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","startPage":"68","endPage":"72 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The bootstrap algorithm: a robust multiuser CDMA detector with time delay variation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624365","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The bootstrap algorithm: a robust multiuser CDMA detector with time delay variation","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624365/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5862595","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The bootstrap algorithm: a robust multiuser CDMA detector with time delay variation","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080355S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"3","articleId":"624365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":624366,"authors":[{"name":"J.

For wideband receivers employing antenna arrays a 2D-RAKE receiver is required and a search for best RAKE taps has to be performed in spatio-temporal domain. This simulation study focuses on 2D-RAKE allocation in the mean energy sense assuming a digital beamforming approach. The scheme permits also a straightforward way to downlink beamforming. In the current method a 2D-channel impulse response is evaluated first and then a two-dimensional search gives the RAKE taps with most energy. A wideband spatio-temporal channel model for urban macro cells is employed. The simulations produce the relative signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) as a function of the number of allocated RAKE taps and the beamwidth of the antenna array. The results show that SINR gains depend strongly on the angular spread of the desired signal. The enhancement in SINR varied approximately between 6-9 dB for a 10-element antenna when four 2D-RAKE taps were exploited. This improvement can be interpreted as an approximate increase in capacity. Increasing the system bandwidth from 1.25 MHz to 5 MHz only 1-3 additional 2D-RAKE taps were required for maintaining the desired SINR level. In the downlink the performance was about 1-3 dB worse than in the uplink.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On RAKE allocation for CDMA receiver employing antenna arrays","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624366","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624366.pdf","startPage":"73","endPage":"78 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624366","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"On RAKE allocation for CDMA receiver employing antenna arrays","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855339","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On RAKE allocation for CDMA receiver employing antenna arrays","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027359S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"4","articleId":"624366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":624369,"authors":[{"name":"U.

It provides real-time recording of signals from multiple input channels. Due to this multielement reception, the incidence angles of the received signal components can be resolved. Wideband sounding provides the delay information. This allows the characterization of the two-dimensional radio channel of adaptive antenna systems in realistic environments. The system is based on a complex wideband radio channel sounder and a fast RF switch. As an example, the system allows measurement of complex impulse responses for a 16-element array with 17 ns delay resolution, and a delay range of 4.3 /spl mu/s for a 26 m/s mobile speed. The continuously recorded path lengths can be over one hundred meters. Practical channel measurements have been performed with a linear array of 8 elements. In these measurements the received signal components could be separated with 13/spl deg/ angular and 20 ns delay resolution. The developed method provides a novel approach to the two-dimensional analysis of the mobile environment.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624370.pdf","startPage":"95","endPage":"99 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization system for radio channel of adaptive array antennas","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Delay","Signal resolution","Antenna measurements","Wideband","Switches","Antenna arrays","Adaptive systems","Radio frequency","Velocity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive array antennas","multichannel measurement system","real-time recording","multiple input channels","multielement reception","wideband sounding","delay information","two-dimensional radio channel","complex wideband radio channel sounder","fast RF switch","impulse responses","16-element array","delay resolution","delay range","mobile speed","linear array","two-dimensional analysis","multipath channels","2.154 GHz","26 m/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Characterization system for radio channel of adaptive array antennas","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855343","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization system for radio channel of adaptive array antennas","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624370.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030126S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"21","articleId":"624370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":624371,"authors":[{"name":"S.

In contrast to MC-CDMA, the SS-MC-MA separates the users' signals according to an FDMA scheme on the sub-carrier level. Thus, the novel scheme avoids multiple access interference (MAI) within a cell. SS-MC-MA can use the same radio interface for the up- and the down-link. Its bandwidth efficiency is comparable to the high bandwidth efficiency achievable with MC-CDMA in the down-link.

Since the number of users in cities is bigger, we consider typical urban channels (TUX) for our simulations.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624373","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624373.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","startPage":"110","endPage":"114 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of MC-FDMA in mobile communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of MC-FDMA in mobile communications","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624373/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855345","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of MC-FDMA in mobile communications","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624373.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035144S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"2","articleId":"624373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":624374,"authors":[{"name":"S.

On the forward link of the system, it is necessary to achieve high bit rate transmission and to reduce the complexity of the receiving terminal. To meet these two requirements, cyclically shifted spreading sequences are utilized. However, it is necessary to orthogonalize the multiple signals since these sequences are cross-correlated. One way of achieving orthogonalization is pre-decorrelation. However, the orthogonality does not clearly appear in a multipath fading channel because of the interchip interference caused by multipath. Therefore in this paper, pre-decorrelation is combined with multicarrier modulation. The results obtained through computer simulation show that the proposed technique can achieve orthogonality in a multipath fading channel. Also the proposed technique makes efficient forward link power control possible, and reduces intercell interference.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624376","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624376.pdf","startPage":"125","endPage":"129 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624376","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A forward link intracell orthogonalization technique using multicarrier pre-decorrelation for CDMA wireless local communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624376","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624376/","displayDocTitle":"A forward link intracell orthogonalization technique using multicarrier pre-decorrelation for CDMA wireless local communication system","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5862599","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A forward link intracell orthogonalization technique using multicarrier pre-decorrelation for CDMA wireless local communication system","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028812S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"3","articleId":"624376","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":624379,"authors":[{"name":"R.

These effects are important for the design and performance evaluation of advanced receiver structures that exploit the inherent channel diversity, e.g., by means of adaptive antennas. The wideband SRCM takes into account all relevant propagation effects observed in real indoor environments. For example, it includes large-scale fluctuations such as transitions where waves are emerging and vanishing as well as the delay drift of the waves. In the paper, the modeling approach adopted for the SRCM is described and illustrated by simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624379.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"144 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624379","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stochastic radio channel model for advanced indoor mobile communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stochastic processes","Stochastic systems","Dispersion","Frequency","Polarization","Receivers","Adaptive arrays","Receiving antennas","Antennas and propagation","Wideband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stochastic radio channel model","advanced indoor mobile communication systems","broadband indoor mobile systems","ACTS project AC085 Magic WAND","SRCM","dispersive radio channels","design","performance evaluation","advanced receiver structure","channel diversity","adaptive antennas","propagation effects","real indoor environments","large-scale fluctuations","delay","SHF","5.2 GHz","17 GHz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Stochastic radio channel model for advanced indoor mobile communication systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855347","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stochastic radio channel model for advanced indoor mobile communication systems","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040267S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"33","articleId":"624379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":624383,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The influence over the average BER of various system parameters like the number of active users, the number of selected outputs or sequence length are considered.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624395","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624395.pdf","startPage":"216","endPage":"220 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624395","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"I-QTCM QPSK synchronous DS/CDMA over frequency-selective multipath Rayleigh fading channels with selection diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624395/","displayDocTitle":"I-QTCM QPSK synchronous DS/CDMA over frequency-selective multipath Rayleigh fading channels with selection diversity","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855359","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"I-QTCM QPSK synchronous DS/CDMA over frequency-selective multipath Rayleigh fading channels with selection diversity","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624395.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040999S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","articleId":"624395","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":624396,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The BER performance of the system is investigated by computer simulation. It is shown that the performance of the proposed system is affected by the CCI per carrier.

The mobile-to-base link is modelled as a Rayleigh fading channel with all users experiencing independent fading. The standard receiver for CDMA systems is susceptible to the near-far effect problem. Power control techniques attempt to overcome near-far effect by varying transmitted power levels to ensure that all signals are received with equal power levels. We evaluated the performance for given a bit rate in a situation with and without power control and selection diversity. Since the power control algorithms cannot perfectly compensate for power fluctuations in a mobile communications channel, the performance of the system is reduced for a given BER. This paper examines the effect of imperfect power control on the number of users by extending analytical techniques that account for multiple access and adjacent cell interference.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624399","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13598/00624399.pdf","startPage":"236","endPage":"240 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.624399","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13598","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage probability of a cellular hybrid DS/SFH CDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624399","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624399/","displayDocTitle":"Outage probability of a cellular hybrid DS/SFH CDMA system","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855363","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Outage probability of a cellular hybrid DS/SFH CDMA system","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00624399.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068119S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"1","articleId":"624399","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":624400,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For efficient use of the highest bandwidth DRAMs, our proposed chip includes a RAMBUS DRAM interface, a burst-transfer controller, and burst buffers.

This approach is applicable to high-speed broadband networks, and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks are addressed in particular. Security management is achieved through a new technique of active connection management with authentication. Past approaches to network security involve firewalls providing selection based on packet filtering and application level proxy gateways. IP level firewalling was sufficient for traditional networks but causes a severe performance degradation in high speed broadband environments. The approach described in this paper discusses the use of an FPGA-based front end processor that filters relevant signaling information to the firewall host while at the same time allowing friendly connections to proceed at line speed with no performance degradation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An FPGA-based coprocessor for ATM firewalls","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The tools include: a partial evaluator, which produces configuration files for a given design, where the number of configurations can be minimised by a process, known as compile-time sequencing; an incremental configuration calculator, which takes the output of the partial evaluator and generates an initial configuration file and incremental configuration files that partially update preceding configurations; and a tool which further optimises designs for FPGAs supporting simultaneous configuration of multiple cells. While many of our techniques are independent of the design language and device used, our tools currently target Xilinx 6200 devices. Simultaneous configuration, for example, can be used to reduce the time for reconfiguring an adder to a subtractor from time linear with respect to its size to constant time at best and logarithmic time at worst.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1997.624605","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

The intention is that a conventional operating system can be extended to manage SLU circuitry implemented using FPGA real estate. In order to minimise operating system overheads, two particular SLU-based virtual hardware models were deemed practical: a \"sea of accelerators\" model and a \"parallel harness\" model. This paper looks in some detail at how SLUs will fit within the overall environment of a fairly conventional hardware/software system. First, there is a discussion of the FPGA-based hardware environment for SLUs, followed by a discussion of the software environment from which SLUs might be used. After this, there is a description of the operational properties that SLUs can have, and how these fit in with the two virtual hardware models. Finally, proposals for standard interfaces between SLUs and their environment are discussed. These interfaces can be regarded as constraints on the designers of SLU circuitry or, more positively, as suppliers of an enriched context within which such circuitry operates. The overall impact of the work presented in the paper is to show that it is feasible to incorporate configurable hardware within traditional computer systems that use high-level language programs and computer operating systems. That is, it should not always be necessary to devise special-purpose hardware/software systems to realise custom computing.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPGA.1997.624607","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13597","startPage":"77","endPage":"86","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Our goal is to use the reconfigurability, of the board's interface to test a system and discover not only the maximum bandwidth and best latency attainable, but also the way to reliably achieve these figures. The board we present uses the now widespread PCI bus. PCI is sufficiently complex, and its implementations sufficiently varied, that it is impossible to guess the performance that can be obtained by a specific board on a specific computer with the only technical characteristics of the two in hand. We observe astonishing performance differences between almost identical systems and comparable figures between small PCs and big servers. Our performance tests can be an end in themselves, however, they also serve to demonstrate the value of a reconfigurable bus interface. With the same board, we can test and choose a system, make informed architectural decisions on the hardware/software interface, and then finely tune the bus interface to get maximum and predictable figures in the running application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systems performance measurement on PCI Pamette","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

RS codes rely on arithmetic in finite, or Galois fields. The specific field GF(2/sup 8/) is of central importance for many practical systems. The most costly, and thus most critical, elementary operations in RS decoders are multiplication and inversion in Galois fields. Although there have been considerable efforts in the area of Galois field arithmetic architectures, there appears to be very little reported work for Galois field arithmetic for reconfigurable hardware. This contribution provides a systematic comparison of two promising arithmetic architecture classes. The first one is based on a standard base representation, and the second one is based on composite fields. For both classes a multiplier and an inverter for GF(2/sup 8/) are described and theoretical gate counts are provided. Using a design entry based on a VHDL description, each architecture is mapped to a popular FPGA and EPLD device. For each mapping an area and a speed optimization was performed. Absolute values with respect to logic cell counts and critical path simulations are provided. The results show that the composite field architectures can have great advantages on both types of reconfigurable platforms. In particular it is found that composite field multipliers can be more than twice as fast as polynomial base multipliers on FPGAs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arithmetic","Reed-Solomon codes","Decoding","Galois fields","Field programmable gate arrays","Error correction codes","Communication systems","CD recording","Satellite communication","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Reed-Solomon codes","field programmable gate arrays","reconfigurable architectures","digital arithmetic","decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["arithmetic architectures","Reed-Solomon decoders","reconfigurable hardware","standard base representation","composite fields","Galois fields","Galois field arithmetic","FPGA","composite field multipliers"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624622","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1997.624622","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings.

In this paper, we present a non-restoring square root algorithm and two very simple single precision floating point square root implementations based on the algorithm on FPGAs. One is low-cost iterative implementation that uses a traditional adder/subtracter. The operation latency is 25 clock cycles and the issue rate is 24 clock cycles. The other is high-throughput pipelined implementation that uses multiple adder/subtracters. The operation latency is 15 clock cycles and the issue rate is one clock cycle. It means that the pipelined implementation is capable of accepting a square root instruction on every clock cycle.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

In addition to a RISC processor, each node contains reconfigurable resources implemented with FPGAs. The in-circuit reprogramability of static RAM based FPGAs allows the computational capabilities of a node to be dynamically matched to the computational requirements of an application. Most reconfigurable computers in existence today rely solely on a large number of FPGAs to perform computations. In contrast, the paper demonstrates the utility of a small number of FPGAs coupled to a RISC processor with a simple interconnect. The article describes a substantive example application that performs HMM training for speech recognition with the reconfigurable platform.","doi":"10.1109/FPGA.1997.624627","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Moreover, using high-resolution TEM observation, it was found that there were no crystalline defects in the edge region. The frequency of leakage currents in short-channel MOSFETs was higher than that of long-channel MOSFETs. The level of leakage current was not changed by the gate voltage and back gate voltage, and the activation energy of the leakage current was almost 0 eV.

This new algorithm is based on the theory of projections onto convex sets (POCS). A new family of directional smoothness constraint sets is defined based on line processes modeling of the image edge structure. The definition of these smoothness sets also takes into account the fact that the visibility of compression artifacts in an image is spatially varying. To overcome the numerical difficulty in computing the projections onto these sets, a divide-and-conquer (DAC) strategy is introduced. According to this strategy, new smoothness sets are derived such that their projections are easier to compute.

A distribution mixture is said to be \"generalized\" when the exact nature of the components is not known, but each belongs to a finite known set of families of distributions. For instance, we can consider a mixture of three distributions, each being exponential or Gaussian. The problem of estimating such a mixture contains thus a new difficulty: we have to label each of three components (there are eight possibilities). We show that the classical mixture estimation algorithms-expectation-maximization (EM), stochastic EM (SEM), and iterative conditional estimation (ICE)-can be adapted to such situations once as we dispose of a method of recognition of each component separately. That is, when we know that a sample proceeds from one family of the set considered, we have a decision rule for what family it belongs to. Considering the Pearson system, which is a set of eight families, the decision rule above is defined by the use of \"skewness\" and \"kurtosis\". The different algorithms so obtained are then applied to the problem of unsupervised Bayesian image segmentation, We propose the adaptive versions of SEM, EM, and ICE in the case of \"blind\", i.e., \"pixel by pixel\", segmentation. \"Global\" segmentation methods require modeling by hidden random Markov fields, and we propose adaptations of two traditional parameter estimation algorithms: Gibbsian EM (GEM) and ICE allowing the estimation of generalized mixtures corresponding to Pearson's system. The efficiency of different methods is compared via numerical studies, and the results of unsupervised segmentation of three real radar images by different methods are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624951/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1997","volume":"6","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5714124","pubMedId":"18282892","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of generalized mixtures and its application in image segmentation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of generalized mixtures and its application in image segmentation","sourcePdf":"00624951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050699S","chronDate":"Oct.  1997","isNumber":"13592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"94","articleId":"624951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":624953,"authors":[{"name":"P.P.

The texture features are extracted by using two-dimensional (2-D) Gabor filters arranged as a set of wavelet bases. The classification model comprises feature quantization, partition, and competition processes. The feature quantization process uses a vector quantizer to quantize the features into codevectors, where the probability of grouping the vectors is modeled as Gibbs distribution. A set of label constraints for each pixel in the image are provided by the partition and competition processes. An energy function corresponding to the a posteriori probability is derived from these processes, and a neural network is used to represent this energy function. The state of the network and the codevectors of the vector quantizer are iteratively adjusted using a deterministic relaxation procedure until a stable state is reached. The final equilibrium state of the vector quantizer gives a classification of the textured image. A cluster validity measure based on modified Hubert index is used to determine the optimal number of texture classes in the image.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624953/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5714125","pubMedId":"18282893","volume":"6","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unsupervised texture classification using vector quantization and deterministic relaxation neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unsupervised texture classification using vector quantization and deterministic relaxation neural network","sourcePdf":"00624953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055462S","chronDate":"Oct.  1997","isNumber":"13592","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"14","articleId":"624953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":624957,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Variable filters are used in many signal processing fields, but the recursive variable filters are extremely difficult to design due to the stability problem. This paper proposes a new method for designing recursive one-dimensional (1-D) variable filters whose stability is guaranteed. The method finds the coefficients of the transfer function of a variable digital filter as the multidimensional (M-D) polynomials of a few variables. The variables specify different frequency-domain characteristics, thus, we call the variables the spectral parameters. In applying the resulting variable filters, substituting different values of the spectral parameters into the M-D polynomials will obtain different filter coefficients and, thus, obtain different frequency-domain characteristics. To guarantee the stability, we first perform coefficient substitutions on the denominator coefficients such that they satisfy the stability conditions. Then both denominator and numerator coefficients are determined as M-D polynomials. In determining the M-D polynomials, we also propose an efficient least-squares approximation method that requires only solving simultaneous linear equations. Two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed variable filter design technique.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/13593/00624989.pdf","startPage":"689","endPage":"695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/82.624989","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.624989","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13593","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=624989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of recursive 1-D variable filters with guaranteed stability","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stability","Polynomials","Digital filters","Multidimensional signal processing","Signal design","Design methodology","Transfer functions","Multidimensional systems","Approximation methods","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive filters","filtering theory","polynomial matrices","circuit stability","least squares approximations","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recursive 1D variable filters","guaranteed stability","digital filter design","adjustable frequency-domain characteristics","signal processing","one-dimensional variable filters","transfer function coefficients","multidimensional polynomials","spectral parameters","coefficient substitutions","denominator coefficients","numerator coefficients","least-squares approximation method","LS method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/624989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Design of recursive 1-D variable filters with guaranteed stability","volume":"44","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5707665","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of recursive 1-D variable filters with guaranteed stability","sourcePdf":"00624989.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032746S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13593","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"90","articleId":"624989","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":625013,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In this work, an adaptive algorithm and a possible implementation of the \"one-shot\" decorrelating detector is proposed.

The proposed technique offers higher throughput efficiency and lower complexity than other serial concatenation schemes.","doi":"10.1109/4234.625037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/4234/13594/00625037.pdf","startPage":"136","endPage":"139","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4234.625037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selective serial concatenation of turbo codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Selective serial concatenation of turbo codes","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5705999","volume":"1","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selective serial concatenation of turbo codes","sourcePdf":"00625037.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018524S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"23","articleId":"625037","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":625110,"authors":[{"name":"D.J.

The PMHT method is presented in a general mixture densities perspective. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is the basic ingredient for estimating mixture parameters.

A constraint is any relation that exists between the state variables. Constraints can be treated as perfect observations. But, linearization errors can prevent the estimate from converging to the true value. Therefore, the SCKF iteratively applies nonlinear constraints as nearly perfect observations, or, equivalently, weakened constraints. Integration of new measurements is interlaced with these iterations, which reduces linearization errors and, hence, improves convergence compared to other iterative methods. The weakening is achieved by artificially increasing the variance of the nonlinear constraint. The paper explains how to choose the weakening values, and when to start and stop the iterative application of the constraint.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625129/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5748452","volume":"19","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A smoothly constrained Kalman filter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A smoothly constrained Kalman filter","sourcePdf":"00625129.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04525S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"94","articleId":"625129","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":625132,"authors":[{"name":"J.S.

This attribute provides robustness in the subspace selection process to achieve reduced-dimensional target detection.

This means that we must radiate the powerful ultrasonic waves whose directivity is sharp. However sound waves have the characteristic that small attenuation in propagation and sharp directivity are incompatible with each other. In order to decrease attenuation rate for distance, the authors used multiple ultrasonic transmitters whose frequency is 40 kHz although their directivities are not sharp. We tried to sharpen the directivity by using plural transmitters and by exciting multiple transmitters whose individual outputs are different from each other. This paper describes how to get sharp directivity by ultrasonic transmitters array and its design method. The effectiveness is confirmed by simulations and experiments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625288/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 Sep 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5724579","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sharpening directivity of ultrasonic range sensor using multiple transmitters by different amplitude and pulse width method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sharpening directivity of ultrasonic range sensor using multiple transmitters by different amplitude and pulse width method","confLoc":"Toowoomba, QLD, Australia","sourcePdf":"00625288.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029034S","chronDate":"23-25 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13610","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4937","citationCount":"2","articleId":"625288","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":625321,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The magnitude of the error depends on the amount of mass load and arm positions and the stiffness characteristics of arms. In this paper a method based on genetic algorithm is used to solve the inverse kinematics of a three degrees of freedom log crane.

A significant reduction in size along with a good compactness can be achieved only by an accurate choice of the network configuration. This configuration has also to guarantee an optimum mechanical reliability and the phase distribution at the output of the network to correctly feed the elements of a linear or two-dimensional microstrip array. We propose practical solutions for implementing beam forming networks to feed a 4-beam or 8-beam smart antenna for GSM, operating over the 880-960 MHz frequency band. These solutions assure acceptable global dimensions for the microstrip networks also at 900 MHz, along with an optimum mechanical implementation and a very interesting electrical performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625388/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5835375","conferenceDate":"13-18 July 1997","displayDocTitle":"Beam forming networks of optimum size and compactness for multibeam antennas at 900 MHz","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam forming networks of optimum size and compactness for multibeam antennas at 900 MHz","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00625388.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040542S","chronDate":"13-18 July 1997","isNumber":"13579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4924","citationCount":"11","articleId":"625388","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":625392,"authors":[{"name":"K.L.

Because this anisotropic dielectric layer causes a change of polarization direction in the reflected light which corresponds to the direction of magnetization, the information is reconstructed by detecting the polarization direction of the scattering light-beam. Although many articles on the theoretical studies of light-beam scattering from the read only type optical disk structure have been reported, articles on the numerical analysis of the magneto-optic disk structure is very few. A three dimensional FDTD method is developed to analyze the scattering of a light-beam from an anisotropic dielectric structure. First, the scattering pattern of the light-beam from a pregroove on a MO disk is calculated. The result is compared with that of the boundary element method to show the validity of the FDTD calculation.

The most important feature of the FDTD method is that broadband frequency information can be provided in a single-pass simulation. Since the results directly produced by a FDTD run are time domain data which may contain multiple frequency and mode contents, the extraction of desired parameters from these data becomes an important issue. Superresolution algorithms such as Prony's method have been used in conjunction with FDTD simulation for parameter extraction previously. We investigate several other applications of superresolution techniques for parameter extraction. The superresolution engine used is the ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Technique) algorithm. It is considered to be more robust with respect to noise when compared to Prony's scheme. In the first application, we consider the problem of extracting multimode parameters of a microstrip transmission line from a single-pass FDTD simulation. The modal dispersion characteristics and the broadband modal field templates of a three-line coupled microstrip structure are extracted by applying ESPRIT to the spatial data samples. In the second application, we consider the problem of extracting the oscillation frequencies of an active microstrip antenna containing active nonlinear devices from the FDTD simulation data.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.625394","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

These simulations are computationally demanding and often exceed available limits of computer resources. In this paper we present a FDTD sub-gridding technique that allows for increased resolution in regions of interest without increasing the overall computational requirements beyond the available resources. Furthermore, the formulation presented here is the first to allow for traversing dielectric boundaries using any integer refinement factor and the maximum Courant number. The technique presented here uses a weighted current value from the coarse region at the boundary between the fine- and coarse-grid regions to update the fine-region tangential fields on that boundary. The weighting function depends on the material properties and the relative position of the fine-region electric field within the current contour at the boundary. The complete formulation of this new technique is described and some results of simulation cases are presented to validate the accuracy and stability of the developed FDTD code. In some simulation examples, computer memory savings as high as 70 times what would have been necessary with a uniform-grid code were achieved. It is shown that errors less than 2 percent are achievable with coarse-to-fine-grid ratios exceeding 10. The new technique is expected to be used in simulating many electrically large and complex structures in the biomedical, microwave processing of materials, and cellular-communications areas.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.625396","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

In Tsao et al. (1988) a cross-shaped slot is fed by a balanced feed network which allows for a high degree of isolation. However, the balanced feed calls for an air-bridge which complicates both the design process and the manufacture. An alleviation to this problem is to separate the two channels onto two different substrate layers separated by the ground plane. In this case the disadvantage is increased cost. Another solution with a single layer feed is presented in Brachat and Baracco (1995) where one channel feeds a single slot centered under the patch whereas the other channel feeds two separate slots placed near the edges of the patch. Our experience is that with this geometry it is hard to achieve a well-matched broadband design since the slots near the edge of the patch present very low coupling. All the above geometries maintain symmetry with respect to the two principal planes if we ignore the small spurious coupling from feed lines in the vicinity of the aperture. We propose to reduce the symmetry to only one principal plane which turns out to be sufficient for high isolation and low cross-polarization. The advantage is that only one layer of feed network is needed, with no air-bridges required. In addition the aperture position is centered under the patch. An important application for dual polarized antennas is base station antennas.

The disadvantage with space diversity is that the antenna systems become large as the antennas have to be separated by several wavelengths to receive independent signals. Polarization diversity for base station antennas has become of interest due to the need to reduce the number of antennas and the size of antenna systems in downtown areas. In a polarization diversity system two antennas with orthogonal polarizations are used to provide independently fading signals. The two orthogonal polarizations are normally horizontal/vertical or /spl plusmn/45/spl deg/ slanted. It was shown in Wahlberg et al. that a /spl plusmn/45/spl deg/ slanted polarization system has better performance than a horizontal/vertical polarization system. As the antennas do not have to be separated by space, the two antennas are normally combined in one. However, these polarization diversity systems put high requirements on the antenna performance such as high isolation between the channels and high cross-polar discrimination. In this paper we discuss the problems with resonances and undesired coupling between the polarizations of a dual polarized slot coupled patch antenna and some solutions to these problems. Results for a 4 element array for the GSM band (870-960 MHz) are presented.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.625411","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

In practice, azimuthal variations are more severe than elevation fluctuations and a one-axis only tracking system, working over a full 360-degree sector, is found to be appropriate. Typically, direction-finding (DF) can be performed with a monopulse system and beam-steering can be achieved mechanically or electronically. Due to the limited electrical size of MT antennas, the sum and difference beams of the standard monopulse system have poor directivity, which makes the tracking system prone to back-lobe locking. Our objective in this paper is to overcome this difficulty by proposing an enhanced monopulse system which is immune to back-lobe locking. This objective was achieved by the implementation of an artificial neural network (ANN) at the output of the antenna array. In this work, a fixed number of three array elements was used. One of the advantages of using an ANN is that the DF system can be trained to compensate for non-ideal behaviour or time degradations of RF circuit components, antenna elements, radomes etc. Such capabilities are demonstrated by the use of the fitting and regression properties of the multilayer neural feedforward with hyperbolic tangent decision functions.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.625422","pdfPath":"/iel3/4924/13579/00625422.pdf","startPage":"2270","endPage":"2273 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

Most of the numerical and analytical techniques used are complicated, ill-posed and require a large computational effort especially when the electrical radius is large as compared to the wavelength. The problem becomes even more complicated when dielectric scatterers are considered. Different numerical methods have been explored in literature to solve the inverse scattering problem. Neural networks are drawing considerable attention as a new paradigm of information processing because of their self-adapting capability in solving problems, more and more applications involving electromagnetic problems are being investigated. A technique based on neural network analysis is presented where the network is trained to model the nonlinear relationship between the dielectric constant and the complex scattering coefficients. The results are verified by applying the technique to a different set of coefficients for a wide range of dielectric constants.

This property can, in principle, be used to develop phase shifters for phased arrays. However, the high dielectric constant and the high loss of pure ferroelectric materials have limited their applications in phased arrays. Improvements in ferroelectric composite materials prompted renewed interest in developing phase shifters at microwave frequencies. A typical phased array uses several thousand radiating elements and phase shifters, and hence it is very expensive. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) is developing a lens antenna that incorporates bulk phase shifting using ferroelectric material. The ferroelectrics were developed at the Army Research Laboratory (ARL); they are low-cost, bulk oxide-ceramic composites of barium strontium titanate oxide (BSTO). The lens approach reduces the number of phase shifters, phase shifter drivers and controls resulting in a low-cost phased array. This paper describes the ferroelectric lens concept and methods of using this lens in developing low-cost phased arrays. The properties of ferroelectric materials and the improvements at the ARL, in reducing the dielectric constant and the loss tangent are then discussed. This is followed by the presentation of the theoretical and experimental results and conclusions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5842146","conferenceDate":"13-18 July 1997","displayDocTitle":"Ferroelectric materials for phased array applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ferroelectric materials for phased array applications","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00625425.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030069S","chronDate":"13-18 July 1997","isNumber":"13579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4924","citationCount":"6","articleId":"625425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":625428,"authors":[{"name":"A.

We also design one-sheet and three-sheet capacitive Jaumann absorbers. Finally we obtain a 20-dB attenuation bandwidth of more than 145% for one-sheet, 173% for two-sheet and 193% for three-sheet capacitive Jaumann EM absorbers, with some acceptable short range for the variables. We design the one-sheet and two-sheet capacitive Jaumann absorbers at low frequency and the three-sheet at high frequency. The 20-dB attenuation bandwidth obtained for the one-sheet and two-sheet capacitive Jaumann absorbers are respectively, from 10 to 77 MHz and, from 4 to 61 MHz. For the three-sheet capacitive Jaumann absorber the 20-dB attenuation bandwidth obtained is from 0.8 GHz to 280 GHz.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 July 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625428/","accessionNumber":"5842149","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-18 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimum design of N sheet capactive Jaumann absorber using genetic algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimum design of N sheet capactive Jaumann absorber using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00625428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034463S","chronDate":"13-18 July 1997","isNumber":"13579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4924","citationCount":"1","articleId":"625428","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":625458,"authors":[{"name":"Seungwon Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Communication, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seungwon Choi","id":"37615823000"},{"name":"Dongun Yun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Communication, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dongun Yun","id":"37344713100"},{"name":"Hyunbae Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Communication, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Hyunbae Lee","id":"37615953900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-4178-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"625458","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":56},"abstract":"The authors present adaptive algorithms for the array antenna system to generate the weight vector which provides the beampattern having its main lobe along the direction of the mobile target subscriber at each snapshot.

The particular receiver studied is a near-far resistant multiuser detector known as the projection receiver (PR). The PR performs multiple access interference resolution for CDMA with error control coding. The output of the front-end of the projection receiver yields a metric for decoding of the coded sequences. This metric allows the use of a standard sequence decoder (e.g., Viterbi algorithm, M-algorithm) for the error control code. The metric computation can be performed adaptively by an extension of the familiar recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm. The adaptive PR operates on a single sample per chip. It is shown that for random spreading codes this algorithm simplifies and can be executed an order of magnitude faster by exploiting the average cross-correlation of the spreading sequences. The performance of both algorithms are studied for CDMA with random spreading sequences and compared to theoretical performance bounds.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computationally efficient multiuser detection for coded CDMA","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.625463","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13614/00625463.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.625463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=625463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Computationally efficient multiuser detection for coded CDMA","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869513","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computationally efficient multiuser detection for coded CDMA","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00625463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067215S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","articleId":"625463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":625464,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

This is demonstrated in the design example of a 4-bit phase shifter for possible use in an L-band vehicle mounted phased array antenna for mobile satellite communications. It is shown that the performance of the phase shifters can be of good quality over a 7% bandwidth (between 1.54 GHz and 1.66 GHz) as is required for the Mobilesat system in Australia. This quality performance is achieved by including extra compensation circuits in the biasing networks of the PIN diodes. By using these extra compensation networks, the parasitic elements are tuned out producing almost ideal on-off switches and therefore good quality phase shifters over the required frequency band.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-18 July 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625505/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"5842183","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"13-18 July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Low cost phase shifters for L-band phased array antennas","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low cost phase shifters for L-band phased array antennas","confLoc":"Montreal, QC, Canada","sourcePdf":"00625505.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027717S","chronDate":"13-18 July 1997","isNumber":"13579","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4924","citationCount":"7","articleId":"625505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":625527,"authors":[{"name":"T.

There are two well known methods for predicting propagation loss. One uses propagation prediction formulas (empirical formulas) generated from measured field strength data, and the other method uses ray-tracing and so is based on geometrical optics (GO). In order to improve the propagation prediction accuracy of the ray-tracing method, multiple reflection and multiple diffraction must be considered. However, it is very difficult to calculate multiple reflection and diffraction losses precisely. Previous studies used simple approximate models to avoid this difficulty. In this paper, we propose a method for calculating multiple diffraction losses precisely, and show prediction results in the case where this method is applied to a propagation prediction system.","doi":"10.1109/APS.1997.625527","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society International Symposium 1997.

At the transmitter, the traffic signals are orthogonal to the pilot signal; however, in frequency selective channels where more than one resolvable multipath component is received, the received traffic channels of one multipath component are no longer orthogonal to the replicate pilot signals of another multipath component. This nonorthogonal multipath noise contribution will cause degradation in the channel estimate and resulting RAKE output. To address this problem, we propose a multipath noise canceller which provides improved capacity and/or signal quality with little additional complexity compared to conventional receivers. This technique is recursive in that it uses the estimated channel coefficients from the previous symbol interval to reconstruct and subtract the multipath noise from the RAKE finger inputs on the current symbol interval. With no changes required to the IS-95 standard and only minimal changes needed at the handset, this technique increases the downlink capacity by 8% and 11% for, respectively, 3-path and 4-path environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13614/00625541.pdf","startPage":"198","endPage":"201 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.625541","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.625541","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=625541","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving detection and estimation in pilot-aided frequency selective CDMA channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Noise cancellation","Downlink","RAKE receivers","Fading","Multipath channels","Transmitters","Signal resolution","Degradation","Recursive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detection","estimation","pilot-aided frequency selective CDMA channels","IS-95 downlink channel","mobile receiver","coherent channel estimates","RAKE receiver","transmitter","traffic signals","frequency selective channel","multipath component","received traffic channels","nonorthogonal multipath noise contribution","RAKE output","multipath noise canceller","complexity","multipath noise","RAKE finger inputs","IS-95 standard","downlink capacity","3-path environments","4-path environments"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625541/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Improving detection and estimation in pilot-aided frequency selective CDMA channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869551","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving detection and estimation in pilot-aided frequency selective CDMA channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00625541.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050399S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"6","articleId":"625541","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":625543,"authors":[{"name":"A.C.K.

The uplink of a DS-CDMA system with coherent detection operating on a flat Rayleigh fading system is considered. The results show that with a realistic feedback power control algorithm, in fast fading the capacity of the system with dual receive antenna diversity can be increased 1.6 times over that of the IS-95 system. It is also demonstrated that the capacity of the system in a slow fading environment increases dramatically over that under fast fading. Therefore, the 1.6 fold advantage of the RAMSIC receiver may be interpreted as the worst case performance advantage. Investigation of transmitter antenna diversity shows that in systems requiring lower BER (10/sup -4/ or less), such as in image and video communication, artificial multipath created by two transmitting antennas increases capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13614/00625543.pdf","startPage":"202","endPage":"207 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.625543","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.625543","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=625543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of antenna diversity on performance of reference symbol assisted interference cancellation in CDMA wireless systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receiving antennas","Rayleigh channels","Fading","Transmitting antennas","Interference cancellation","Multiaccess communication","Feedback","Power control","Diversity methods","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna diversity","performance","CDMA wireless systems","reference symbol assisted multi-stage interference cancelling receiver","DS-CDMA system","coherent detection","flat Rayleigh fading system","feedback power control algorithm","capacity","dual receive antenna diversity","slow fading environment","fast fading","RAMSIC receiver","transmitter antenna diversity","BER","image communication","video communication","artificial multipath","transmitting antennas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625543/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Effect of antenna diversity on performance of reference symbol assisted interference cancellation in CDMA wireless systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869552","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of antenna diversity on performance of reference symbol assisted interference cancellation in CDMA wireless systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00625543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043909S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"1","articleId":"625543","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":625545,"authors":[{"name":"T.F.

The proposed indoor system shares the same frequency band as the outdoor ANSI-008 based cellular PCS network and operates within its coverage area. Due to the time division duplexing nature of the residential system, both the forward and reverse link signals are transmitted in the same frequency band in different time slots. In principle the indoor system may operate either in the PCS uplink or the PCS downlink frequency band.

One particular multicarrier modulation format, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), has been investigated for possible use in mobile communications (Cimini, 1985). With the OFDM format and to combat the effect of the multipath fading channel in mobile communications, an amplitude and phase correction scheme using a frequency pilot has also been investigated previously (McGeehan and Bateman, 1983; and Lenaerd and Sollenberger, 1980). However, this correction process overloads the mobile receiver with additional complexity which results in a more complex mobile handset with higher power consumption as well as higher cost. In this paper a new frequency pilot based correction scheme is proposed. This scheme is applicable on systems operating with OFDM and frequency division duplexing (FDD). The proposed scheme is suitable for fast fading channels.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13614/00625564.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"278 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.625564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.625564","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13614","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=625564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced mobile complexity scheme for fast fading channel estimation in OFDM-FDD mobile communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Base stations","Mobile communication","Bit rate","OFDM","Frequency estimation","Costs","Signal analysis","Phase estimation","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reduced mobile complexity scheme","fast fading channel estimation","OFDM-FDD mobile communication systems","multicarrier techniques","multicarrier modulation","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multipath fading channel","mobile communications","mobile receiver","mobile handset","frequency pilot based correction scheme","frequency division duplexing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625564/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Reduced mobile complexity scheme for fast fading channel estimation in OFDM-FDD mobile communication systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869564","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced mobile complexity scheme for fast fading channel estimation in OFDM-FDD mobile communication systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00625564.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037667S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"2","articleId":"625564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":625565,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The paper presents the impact of solid-state amplifiers on the Globalstar forward link multiplex for two possible payload configurations namely single PA per beam and active phased-array on-board antennas.

This leads naturally to a discussion of the matching pursuit algorithm for deriving decompositions using over complete dictionaries of time-frequency atoms; specifically, we compare expansions using Gabor atoms and damped sinusoids.

Possible scenarios of degradation mechanisms, thermally activated, but accelerated by the presence of space charges, are examined. The model which derives from this approach has some interesting features: it is characterized by electrical and thermal thresholds, its parameters have a physical background, it can be cast into a probabilistic framework. Acceleration of aging due to space charges is attributed to a reduction of the free-energy barrier to degradation, seen as a local partially-reversible reaction, which is caused by energy stored in space-charge centers. The validity of the model is limited to dc voltage, and to the time of formation of microcavity-crazes, rather than to breakdown times, since other mechanisms will occur under electrical field once large enough cavities are formed in the insulation. The model is applied to the results of thermo-electrical life tests performed on PET, showing very good fitting, as well as interesting relationships between parameter estimates and insulation morphology. It is shown that the model can also fit well to ac life data, where it takes on a phenomenological meaning.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel4/94/13620/00625642.pdf","startPage":"496","endPage":"506","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/94.625642","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/94.625642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13620","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=625642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The role of trapped space charges in the electrical aging of insulating materials","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space charge","Thermal degradation","Breakdown voltage","Polymers","Plastic insulation","Thermal stresses","Acceleration","Accelerated aging","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Life testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polymers","organic insulating materials","ageing","space charge","insulation testing","life testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trapped space charge","electrical aging","polymeric insulating material","degradation","thermal activation","free energy barrier","partially reversible reaction","microcavity craze","thermo-electrical life test","PET","morphology","probabilistic model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"The role of trapped space charges in the electrical aging of insulating materials","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5740765","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The role of trapped space charges in the electrical aging of insulating materials","sourcePdf":"00625642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047047S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13620","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"293","articleId":"625642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":625683,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

One very important issue currently being tackled is the development of knowledge based decision support systems which must be incorporated into all areas of automation. To build a robust knowledge base requires a systematic design methodology and a suitable modeling and analysis tool. Petri net has proven itself to be an excellent system modeling tool in computer software/hardware, communication, manufacturing, and scheduling. The work presented here is to attack the problem of diagnosing and managing shop floor which requires the incorporation of learning algorithm into current FCPN as a knowledge base developing tool. This paper first presents a systematic knowledge base design methodology and then the development of fuzzy colored Petri nets (FCPN) with the incorporation of genetic learning algorithm which can be used in developing knowledge based systems with fuzzy sets and logic.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.625727","startPage":"82","endPage":"87 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

With technological advances, notably the World-Wide Web (WWW), it allows every ordinary information owner to offer information online for others to access and retrieve. However, it also makes up a global information system that is extremely large-scale, diverse and dynamic. Internet agents and Internet search engines have been used to deal with such problems. But the search results are usually not quite relevant to what a user wants since most of them use simple keyword matching. In this paper, we propose a natural language processing based agent (NIAGENT) that understands a user's natural query. NIAGENT not only cooperates with a meta Internet search engine in order to increase recall of web pages but also analyzes the contents of the referenced documents to increase precision. Moreover, the proposed agent is autonomous, light-weight, and multithreaded. The architectural design also represents an interesting application of a distributed and cooperative computing paradigm. A prototype of NIAGENT, implemented in Java, shows its promise to find more useful information than keyword based searching.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

Usually a 3D vector quantization is applied to trivariant color spaces. Current trends in image coding exploit the advantage of subband/wavelet decompositions in reducing the complexity in optimal scalar/vector quantizer (SQ/VQ) design. We have used adaptive vector quantization of wavelet coefficients of subimages in each color plane in RGB color space. Our design of vector quantizers using two neuro-fuzzy clustering algorithms namely AFLC-VQ, and IAFC-VQ generates very low bit rate image encoder in color as well as monochrome and outperforms other similar designs in minimizing distortion arising from quantization. Further tuning of these algorithms, and addition of an entropy coder module after the VQ stage could result in extremely low bit rates (compression ratio around 100:1) at minimal distortion.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.625746","startPage":"184","endPage":"188 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

The requirement that F~/sup /spl alpha/(1)//spl sub/F~/sup /spl alpha/(2/) whenever /spl alpha/(1)>/spl alpha/(2) imposes an enormous number of constraints on the weight parameterizations during training. This problem can be solved through a careful choice of weight representation. This new representation is unconstrained, so that standard neural network training techniques may be applied. Unfortunately, fuzzy number neural networks still have many parameters to pick during training, since each weight is represented by a vector. Thus moderate to large fuzzy number neural networks suffer from the usual maladies of very large neural networks. In this paper, we discuss a method for effectively reducing the dimensionality of networks during training. Each fuzzy number weight is represented by the endpoints of its /spl alpha/-cuts for some discretization 0/spl les//spl alpha//sub 1/</spl alpha//sub 2/<...</spl alpha//sub n//spl les/1. To reduce dimensionality, training is first done using only a small subset of the /spl alpha//sub i/. After successful training, linear interpolation is used to estimate additional /spl alpha/-cut endpoints. The network is then retrained to tune these interpolated values. This refinement is repeated as needed until the network is fully trained at the desired discretization in /spl alpha/.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.625747","startPage":"189","endPage":"194 vol.1","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

The proposed network has recurrent connections from the output layer to the context layer as the Jordan network. The context layer is expanded to a number of sublayers so that the necessary information for time series processing can be held for longer time. Most of the learning algorithms for the conventional recurrent networks are based on the backpropagation algorithm so that the number of epochs required for convergence tends to increase. The MOE used in the proposed network employs a modular approach. Trained with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, the MOE performs very fast convergence especially in the initial steps. The proposed network can also employ the EM algorithm so that faster convergence is expected. We have examined the ability of the proposed network by some computer simulations. It is shown that the proposed network is faster than the conventional ones in the number of epochs required for convergence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/625807/","accessionNumber":"5753193","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Recurrent neural network using mixture of experts for time series processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recurrent neural network using mixture of experts for time series processing","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00625807.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044327S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4942","citationCount":"1","articleId":"625807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":625827,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

Heterogeneous parallel computing provides a variety of architectural capabilities, orchestrated to perform an application whose tasks have such diverse execution requirements. A key issue that must be addressed in embedding real-time applications on heterogeneous parallel computing architectures is the design of a high-level operating system for selecting algorithms, matching subtasks to processors, and scheduling subtask execution. Essentially, high-level descriptions of an application would be \"intelligently executed\" by such an operating system. This paper presents on-going research in the development of an Intelligent Operating System, specifically describing the mechanism for the selection of algorithms that functionally satisfy the processing needs of ATR subtasks. The methodology presented here can also be used for other application domains and classes of hardware platforms whose characteristics are similar to those of the applications and platform considered here.","doi":"10.1109/ICSMC.1997.625827","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics.

Binary addition is carried out using a fast redundant-to-binary converter. It is shown that appropriate encoding of the redundant digits and recasting the binary addition as a redundant-to-binary conversion reduces the latency of addition from Wt/sub fa/ to Wt/sub mux/ where t/sub fa/ and t/sub mux/, respectively, represent binary full adder and multiplexer delays, and W is the word-length. A family of fast converter architectures is developed based on tree-type (obtained using look-ahead techniques) and carry-select approaches. The carry-generation component is the critical component in redundant-to-binary conversion and binary addition. It is shown that, if the word-length, W, is a power of two, then all carry signals can be generated in log/sub 2/Wt/sub max/ time using W(log/sub 2/W-1)+1 multiplexers using a tree-type converter. It is shown that fastest binary addition can be performed using (Wlog/sub 2/W+1) multiplexers in time (log/sub 2/W+1)t/sub max/. If the specified converter latency is greater than log/sub 2/W/sub mux/, then a family of converters using fewest multiplexers can be designed based on carry-select approach. It is shown that the power consumption in carry-select adders is minimized by increasing the number of segments in the adder.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13622","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SIPS.1997.626129","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

Various applications of CNN are reported such as a feature extraction of the patterns, an extraction of the edges or corners of a figure, noise exclusion, searching in maze and so forth. CNN is also effective as the associative memory by using a noncloning template. Hopfield network is widely known as the neural network with associative memory function, but not many images can be registered on account, of the restrictions. While in CNN, it is possible to embed many images. A 9/spl times/9 matrix Hopfield network can store at most 6/spl sim/9 images, and the same size CNN can store over 30 images. Although CNN is able to embed many images, some uninvited images are included in the memories.

In the architecture level, a distributed arithmetic (DA) based inner product computing scheme is devised to achieve the high throughput operation. In the circuit level, a bit serial systolic array circuitry is derived for modular and low complexity design. Performance simulation is conducted first to determine the design spec and the VLSI implementation features a 4000/spl times/3400 um/sup 2/ core design with 100,000 transistors. Post layout simulation result indicates the resultant 4-tap adaptive IIR filter design can reach a processing rate as high as 3.33 M samples per second.","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

Carrierless AM/PM (CAP) transmission scheme, which is a standard for numerous broadband communication systems including ATM-LAN networks, employs PSPE at the receiving end to combat channel distortion and crosstalk. The conventional PSPE requires two independent adaptive filters that form the in-phase and the quadrature phase equalizers. The Hilbert relationship between the in-phase and quadrature phase equalizers in the PSPE is exploited to develop the proposed architecture. It is shown that, by employing the proposed receiver architecture in a 51.84 Mb/s ATM-LAN environment: (i) a net saving in power is obtained as long as the length of the Hilbert filter is less than 130, (ii) a saving of up to 18% can be achieved with a degradation of less that 0.5 dB.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-power architecture for phase-splitting passband equalizer","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE Workshop on Signal Processing Systems.

Designers of electronic ballasts have been interested in determining the frequencies of destabilizing resonances to avoid in the lamps, or conversely, the allowed frequency bands and threshold levels for modulation components in the lamp power. Acoustic resonance frequencies have previously been measured by a number of techniques, including external sound measurement and visual observation of arc instabilities. An unobtrusive acoustic frequency measurement technique is presented in this paper. The small-signal frequency response of fluctuations in light intensity, as measured with a broadband photodiode, to lamp power with intentionally introduced bandlimited noise can be used to probe the acoustic frequencies without major disruption of the operating lamp. The purpose of this paper is to explain, in detail, the experimental technique and its usefulness. The experimental setup and procedure are described. Measured frequency responses, from 10 kHz to 60 kHz, are presented for selected metal halide lamps. This work is put in context with past experimental and theoretical efforts.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/626379/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5767204","volume":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optical measurement of acoustic resonance frequencies in HID lamps","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical measurement of acoustic resonance frequencies in HID lamps","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00626379.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028354S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13612","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939","citationCount":"28","articleId":"626379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":626381,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Selection and configuration in turn require access to accurate, up-to-date information on the structure and state of available resources. Unfortunately no standard mechanism exists for organizing or accessing such information. Consequently different tools and applications adopt ad hoc mechanisms, or they compromise their portability and performance by using default configurations. We propose a Metacomputing Directory Service that provides efficient and scalable access to diverse, dynamic, and distributed information about resource structure and state. We define an extensible data model to represent required information and present a scalable, high-performance, distributed implementation. The data representation and application programming interface are adopted from the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; the data model and implementation are new. We use the Globus distributed computing toolkit to illustrate how this directory service enables the development of more flexible and efficient distributed computing services and applications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A directory service for configuring high-performance distributed computations","publicationTitle":"Proceedings.

Industrial motion device actuator nonlinearities are in this class of functions, therefore, the new NN structure is ideal for motion control applications in robotics and other industrial systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISIC.1997.626458","pdfPath":"/iel3/4951/13631/00626458.pdf","startPage":"227","endPage":"232","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 12th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 12th IEEE International Symposium on Intelligent Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIC.1997.626458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network approximation of piecewise continuous functions: application to friction compensation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/626458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Neural network approximation of piecewise continuous functions: application to friction compensation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5738579","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network approximation of piecewise continuous functions: application to friction compensation","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"00626458.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088223S","chronDate":"16-18 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4951","citationCount":"10","articleId":"626458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":626459,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.Y.

Rigorous definitions to quantify the generalization ability of a neural network in the context of system control are given. Utilizing these definitions, it is proved that a successfully trained neural network always generalize \"well\" to some extent. This dual property of a trained neural network provides further justification for neuro-control approaches, because the added benefit of generalization is now analytically assured. In addition, a method for estimating the extent to which a trained neural network will generalize is presented. The results of this work provide new tools for performance analysis of neural-control systems, and represents a first step towards a rigorous framework for performance-oriented analysis and synthesis of neural networks for control.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/626459/","accessionNumber":"5738580","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network generalization and system sensitivity in feedback control systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network generalization and system sensitivity in feedback control systems","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"00626459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026075S","chronDate":"16-18 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4951","articleId":"626459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":626465,"authors":[{"name":"D.

GAs allow more realistic and more easily understood definitions of constrained optimization algorithms. The constraints are expressed in a general explicit language.

Even in a defect-free manufacturing environment, random variations in the APD fabrication process lead to varying levels of device performance. Accurate performance prediction requires precise characterization of these variations. The approach described herein requires a model of the probability distribution of each of the relevant process variables, as well as a model to account for the correlation between this measured process data and device performance metrics. Neural networks are proposed as a tool for generating these models, which enable the computation of the joint density function required for predicting performance using Jacobian transformation method. The resulting density function can then be numerically integrated to determine parametric yield. In applying this methodology to MQW APDs, using a small number of test devices enables accurate prediction of the expected performance variation of APD gain and noise in larger populations of devices. This approach potentially allows yield estimation prior to high volume manufacturing.","doi":"10.1109/IEMT.1997.626885","startPage":"105","endPage":"112","displayPublicationTitle":"Twenty First IEEE/CPMT International Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium Proceedings 1997 IEMT Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel3/4943/13621/00626885.pdf","publicationTitle":"Twenty First IEEE/CPMT International Electronics Manufacturing Technology Symposium Proceedings 1997 IEMT Symposium","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMT.1997.626885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13621","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluating the manufacturability of GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well avalanche photodiodes using neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium arsenide","Quantum well devices","Density functional theory","Avalanche photodiodes","Manufacturing processes","Fabrication","Probability distribution","Measurement","Neural networks","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gallium arsenide","aluminium compounds","III-V semiconductors","semiconductor quantum wells","avalanche photodiodes","semiconductor device manufacture","circuit optimisation","integrated circuit yield","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["manufacturability","multiple quantum well avalanche photodiodes","neural networks","parametric yield prediction","defect-free manufacturing environment","device performance","performance prediction","probability distribution","joint density function","Jacobian transformation method","high volume manufacturing","III-V semiconductors","GaAs-AlGaAs"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/626885/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Evaluating the manufacturability of GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well avalanche photodiodes using neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"13-15 Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5794791","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluating the manufacturability of GaAs/AlGaAs multiple quantum well avalanche photodiodes using neural networks","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00626885.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035554S","chronDate":"13-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13621","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4943","articleId":"626885","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":626903,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Direct measurement using human observers is possible for some applications, but this is a time consuming operation that must be performed under carefully controlled conditions. A faster and more easily standardized approach is to use a vision model that provides accurate estimates of the visibility of differences between original and distorted image sequences. A model that fulfils this need is the Sarnoff just-noticeable difference (JND) model. This model is based on known physiological and psychophysical principles of human visual discrimination performance, rather than on particular classes of image distortions, and is therefore more robust across the often unpredictable range of distortions that can occur in modern digital video. The operation and general structure of the JND model are described, and its performance in a range of video applications is discussed.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A human vision system model for objective picture quality measurements","publicationTitle":"1997 International Broadcasting Convention IBS 97","doi":"10.1049/cp:19971319","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 International Broadcasting Convention IBS 97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4959/13639/00626903.pdf","startPage":"498","endPage":"503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1049/cp:19971319","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13639","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=626903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IET","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/626903/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"A human vision system model for objective picture quality measurements","conferenceDate":"12-16 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5751946","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A human vision system model for objective picture quality measurements","confLoc":"Amsterdam, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"00626903.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046423S","chronDate":"12-16 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13639","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4959","citationCount":"28","articleId":"626903","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":626956,"authors":[{"name":"A.S.

This system seamlessly integrates and applies a variety of virtual and physical tools, each customized for specific tasks. The Jot interface not only moves smoothly from one tool to another but also physically and cognitively matches individual tools to the tasks they perform. In particular, we exploit the notion that gestural interaction is more direct, in many cases, than traditional widget based interaction. We also respect the time tested observation that some operations-even conceptually three dimensional ones-are better performed with 1D or 2D input devices, whereas other operations are more naturally performed using stereoscopic views, higher DOF input devices, or both. Ultimately we strive for a 3D modeling system with an interface as transparent as the interaction afforded by a pencil and a sheet of paper. For example, the system should facilitate the tasks of drawing and erasing and provide an easy transition between the two. Jot emerged from our previous work on a mouse based system, called Sketch, for gesturally creating imprecise 3D models. Jot extends Sketch's functionality to a wider spectrum of modeling, from concept design to detailed feature based parametric parts. Jot also extends the interaction in Sketch to better support individual modeling tasks. We extended Sketch's gestural framework to integrate interface components ranging from traditional desktop interface widgets to context sensitive gestures to direct manipulation techniques originally designed for immersive VR.","doi":"10.1109/38.626956","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","startPage":"6","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/38/13642/00626956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/38.626956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Seamless interaction in virtual reality","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual reality","Java","Wheels","Switches","Testing","Web sites","Graphics","Topology","Geometry","Surface fitting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","design engineering","engineering graphics","graphical user interfaces","interactive systems","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["seamless interaction","novel research interface","virtual reality modeling","Jot interface","cognitive matching","gestural interaction","widget based interaction","direct manipulation techniques","stereoscopic views","3D modeling system","drawing","erasing","mouse based system","Sketch","imprecise 3D models","concept design","detailed feature based parametric parts","immersive VR","individual modeling tasks","gestural framework","desktop interface widgets","context sensitive gestures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov/Dec 1997","displayDocTitle":"Seamless interaction in virtual reality","volume":"17","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5746535","publicationDate":"Nov.-Dec. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/626956/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Seamless interaction in virtual reality","sourcePdf":"00626956.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033615S","chronDate":"Nov/Dec 1997","isNumber":"13642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"38","citationCount":"11","articleId":"626956","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":626980,"authors":[{"name":"M.D. Addlesee","affiliation":["Olivetti and Oracle Research Laboratory, USA"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Addlesee","id":"37064226300"},{"name":"A.

It is based on the estimate of the local mean attenuation on the radio links from a mobile terminal to each of the surrounding base stations. The estimate is carried out through proper filtering of the sequences of signal strength measurements performed on the received pilot signals. Two performance measures are considered: the probability that the best base station will not be selected, and the average number of membership switchings per time unit. Assuming a channel model with log-normal shadowing and fast fading superimposed, it is seen that a proper choice of the filter parameters is required to achieve the lowest values for these performance measures.

A rational design method to divide the filter is proposed; the filter cell that has narrowest equivalent noise bandwidth in the filter is chosen as the back part, while the remainder constitutes the front part. Moreover, memories are employed to eliminate DC offset in baseband signals.

CDMA has inherent capability to control the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements by assigning different power levels to each traffic type. Toward this, optimum power control schemes have been investigated. The main drawback of the previously proposed algorithms is that they would require all users' transmission state necessitating a complicated control process or peak-rate bandwidth allocation. To overcome this, we exploit the Markovian property to obtain the statistics of the traffic. The statistical formulation is presented for allocating power distributedly so as to keep the \"collision\" probability below a predefined probability. Numerical examples show that the distributed power control scheme allows better utilization of wireless resources through statistical multiplexing than peak-rate bandwidth assignment, and it does not require a complicated control process while keeping total transmitted power at slightly greater than optimum power control.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13618/00627017.pdf","startPage":"903","endPage":"907 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627017","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627017","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed power control for various QoS in a CDMA wireless system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Multiaccess communication","Statistical distributions","Traffic control","Process control","Channel allocation","Bandwidth","Control systems","Linear programming","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA wireless system","QoS","distributed power control","quality-of-service","power leve","traffic type","optimum power control","peak-rate bandwidth allocation","Markovian property","traffic statistics","collision probability","wireless resources utilization","statistical multiplexing","total transmitted power","multimedia wireless system","cellular system","uplink"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627017/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Distributed power control for various QoS in a CDMA wireless system","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855511","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed power control for various QoS in a CDMA wireless system","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00627017.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088998S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"3","articleId":"627017","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":627018,"authors":[{"name":"Jyh-Hong Wen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jyh-Hong Wen","id":"37615256600"},{"name":"Long-Chyuan Yeh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Long-Chyuan Yeh","id":"37618810200"},{"name":"Jang-Ren Chiou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jang-Ren Chiou","id":"37610668600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3871-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"627018","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"abstract":"A modified multi-step SIR-based down-link power control method is proposed The main idea is to predict the variation of Rayleigh fading from the received signal-to-interference ratio and then to track it in time.

We first introduce a new mathematical technique that can be considered as generalization of FM noise-click theory, and thus allows insights into the error mechanisms. Building on those insights, we propose and verify that a nonlinear frequency discriminator can achieve zero error floor for pure binary FSK and drastically reduced the error floor for filtered FSK by clipping off the ISI-induced FM clicks. The stronger the filtering (before or after the frequency discriminator), the more the beneficial effect of the nonlinearity is reduced. Finally, we show that increasing the modulation index decreases the error floor, especially in the presence of frequency shifts.

A pilot symbol-assisted channel estimation scheme that uses weighted multi-slot averaging (WMSA) is presented for coherent RAKE combining. The BER performance achievable by WMSA coherent RAKE combining is evaluated by computer simulations under multipath Rayleigh fading environments and compared with those of other channel estimation methods. For the DS-CDMA reverse link, fast transmit power control (TPC) based on measured signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is employed so the simulation also considers fast closed loop TPC. It is demonstrated by computer simulations that the required signal energy per bit-to-background noise power spectrum density ratio (E/sub b//N/sub 0/) can be reduced by about 0.8 dB compared to RAKE combining using simple linear interpolation and that the E/sub b//N/sub 0/ loss from the ideal channel estimation is as small as 0.5 dB both with and without antenna diversity. The BER performance achievable by the time multiplexed pilot is also compared with that of the parallel pilot channel.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13618/00627027.pdf","startPage":"954","endPage":"958 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627027","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627027","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627027","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation using time multiplexed pilot symbols for coherent RAKE combining for DS-CDMA mobile radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Computer simulation","Diversity reception","Fading","Rayleigh channels","Power control","Power measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pseudonoise codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","time multiplexed pilot symbols","coherent RAKE combining","DS-CDMA mobile radio","forward links","reverse links","pilot symbols transmission","data slot","fading channels estimation","pilot symbol-assisted channel estimation","weighted multi-slot averaging","BER performance","computer simulations","multipath Rayleigh fading","transmit power control","signal-to-interference plus noise ratio","SINR","linear interpolation","signal energy per bit","background noise power spectrum density ratio","antenna diversity","cellular personal/mobile radio systems","time multiplexed pilot","parallel pilot channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627027/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation using time multiplexed pilot symbols for coherent RAKE combining for DS-CDMA mobile radio","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855512","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation using time multiplexed pilot symbols for coherent RAKE combining for DS-CDMA mobile radio","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00627027.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048238S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"49","articleId":"627027","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":627029,"authors":[{"name":"D.

In DS-CDMA communications, all of the users' signals overlap in time and frequency and cause mutual interference. In this paper a novel multi-user decoding scheme for coded synchronous DS-CDMA is proposed. The decoder performs joint successive interference cancellation (SIC) and Viterbi decoding (VD) in each step of the interference cancellation. In a conventional SIC scheme, SIC is performed first, followed by VD that uses the outputs of the last stage of the SIC scheme for metric calculation. Simulated bit error probability for the proposed scheme is presented and compared with bit error probability of a conventional scheme. A capacity increase of at least 4 compared to SIC followed by VD is reported in one example.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627068","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13618/00627068.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13618","startPage":"1161","endPage":"1170 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint interference cancellation and Viterbi decoding in DS-CDMA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Joint interference cancellation and Viterbi decoding in DS-CDMA","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627068/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855551","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint interference cancellation and Viterbi decoding in DS-CDMA","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00627068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030225S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"8","articleId":"627068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":627069,"authors":[{"name":"R.

We derive the switch mechanism which minimizes the mean-squared error (MSE) at the RAKE output. This switched-MNC detector, when compared with the conventional RAKE receiver, demonstrates significant performance gains, increasing the downlink capacity of a typical IS-95 system by up to 10%, while requiring minimal additional complexity when implemented using a simple recursive structure for the MNC function. Furthermore, we observe that almost all of the performance gains of the MMSE switched-MNC detector can be achieved using the simpler, ad-hoc, \"always-on\" MNC detector, in which pilot multipath noise cancellation always occurs at each finger input without regard to minimizing the MSE.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13618/00627071.pdf","startPage":"1176","endPage":"1180 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627071","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627071","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627071","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving receiver performance for pilot-aided frequency selective CDMA channels using a MMSE switch mechanism and multipath noise canceller","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Detectors","Switches","Noise cancellation","RAKE receivers","Downlink","Fading","Multipath channels","Fingers","Performance gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver performance","pilot-aided frequency selective CDMA channels","MMSE switch mechanism","multipath noise canceller","IS-95 downlink channel","pilot signal","mobile receiver","coherent channel estimates","RAKE receiver","recursive multipath noise cancellation detector","on/off switch mechanism","RAKE finger","mean-squared error","RAKE output","switched-MNC detector","downlink capacity","IS-95 system","always-on MNC detector","pilot multipath noise cancellation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627071/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Improving receiver performance for pilot-aided frequency selective CDMA channels using a MMSE switch mechanism and multipath noise canceller","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855553","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving receiver performance for pilot-aided frequency selective CDMA channels using a MMSE switch mechanism and multipath noise canceller","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00627071.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028366S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"2","articleId":"627071","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":627072,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is assumed that the transmitter does not know the channel but seeks to choose a codebook that guarantees a diversity gain of r/sub 1/ when there is no mobility and a diversity gain of r/sub 2//spl ges/r/sub 1/ when the channel is fast fading. A solution to this problem is unveiled in this paper. Here, the encoded data is split into n streams that are simultaneously transmitted using n transmit antennas. The signal received at each receive antenna is a superposition of the faded versions of the n transmitted signals. We derive performance criteria for designing codes having the aforementioned properties. Performance is shown to be determined by diversity advantage quantified by a rank/distance and coding advantage quantified by a determinant/product criterion. The criteria is used to design codes for both slow and rapid fading channels. The constructed codes have remarkable performance in low signal to noise ratios and are suitable for improving the frequency reuse factor under a variety of mobility conditions.","doi":"10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627077","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 8th International Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications - PIMRC '97","pdfPath":"/iel3/4928/13618/00627077.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PIMRC.1997.627077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13618","startPage":"1206","endPage":"1210 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-rate multi-dimensional space-time codes for both slow and rapid fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-rate multi-dimensional space-time codes for both slow and rapid fading channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627077/","conferenceDate":"1-4 Sept. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5855558","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-rate multi-dimensional space-time codes for both slow and rapid fading channels","confLoc":"Helsinki, Finland","sourcePdf":"00627077.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030544S","chronDate":"1-4 Sep 1997","isNumber":"13618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4928","citationCount":"9","articleId":"627077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":627080,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It is motivated by the real possibility of identifying radio transmitters used in violation of federal and international regulations. A system has been developed which takes the beginning of a radio transmission and separates it from ambient channel noise using a multifractal segmentation technique. Then, significant features are extracted from the transient and a more compact multifractal model is obtained. Finally, this model is analysed by a neural network for classification. Preliminary results indicate that classification using multifractal models is feasible. More specifically, a probabilistic neural network has been trained using 160 out of 415 available transients. Testing the system with the remaining 255 transients produced results in which 92.5% of the transients were classified correctly.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE WESCANEX 97 Communications, Power and Computing.

This results in lowering the signal to noise ratio necessary to achieve a given frame error rate (FER). However, accurate tracking of multipath fading has the negative effect of increasing the other-cell interference level during periods of deep fades. In this work, we evaluate the capacity of a direct sequence CDMA system (DS/CDMA) assuming low mobility users and taking into account the increase in the other-cell interference due to perfect tracking of multipath fading. The effect of the number of fading resolvable paths on system capacity is determined and the increase in the capacity due to soft handoff is found for different soft handoff thresholds. Finally we investigate the effect of limiting the maximum transmitted power to compensate for multipath fading and find that a limit of 10 dB results in maximizing the system capacity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the capacity of a cellular DS/CDMA system under slow multipath fading and fixed step power control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627185","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627185.pdf","startPage":"352","endPage":"355 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627185","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627185/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity of a cellular DS/CDMA system under slow multipath fading and fixed step power control","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869895","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity of a cellular DS/CDMA system under slow multipath fading and fixed step power control","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039333S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"5","articleId":"627185","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":627186,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

In the absence of tracking errors, it has been shown that it is desirable to decrease the rate of a convolutional coder. The resulting coding gain may, however, result in increased tracking errors due to the lowering of required signal-to-interference level. Thus, tracking errors push the bandwidth tradeoff between coding and spreading towards more spreading. It is shown how the tradeoff in allocating the bandwidth expansion between coding and spreading is sensitive to the standard deviation of the code-tracking errors. The tradeoff between the effects of tracking errors and tracking loop time-constant is quantified.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627188.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"370 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of tracking errors on the coding-spreading tradeoff in CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Tracking loops","Bandwidth","Convolutional codes","Bit error rate","Convolution","Error correction codes","Intelligent networks","Lifting equipment","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking errors","coding-spreading tradeoff","CDMA systems","fixed DS-CDMA bandwidth expansion","code-tracking errors","convolutional coder","coding gain","signal-to-interference level","bandwidth expansion","tracking loop time-constant"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627188/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Effect of tracking errors on the coding-spreading tradeoff in CDMA systems","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869898","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of tracking errors on the coding-spreading tradeoff in CDMA systems","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627188.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026616S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"1","articleId":"627188","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":627191,"authors":[{"name":"Jin Yang","affiliation":["AirTouch Communications, Inc., Walnut Creek, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jin Yang","id":"37350848200"},{"name":"W.C.Y.

In such situations, one must resort to a form of differential detection (DD) that has the capability to remove the effect of frequency variations. This paper studies the performance of a centre sampling double differential detection (CSDDD) system in the presence of frequency uncertain channels. A fast frequency hopping (FFH) spread spectrum (SS) using Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) signals transmitted through severely restricted bandwidth (BW) Rayleigh channels are used for data modulation. The performance of the proposed system is analyzed in a two-path Rayleigh fading channel taking into account frequency-selective fading (FSF), carrier random frequency shift, intersymbol interference (ISI), Doppler frequency shift, cochannel interference (CCI) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), while the receiver (RX) rejects a specified amount of adjacent channel interference (ACI). It is shown that the CSDDD scheme has a potential to combat the effect of frequency shifts and its performance is slightly degraded when random frequency shifts are introduced into the carrier. Furthermore there is a significant improvement in the error rate performance by utilizing the frequency diversity inherent in the FFH system compared to other systems. Therefore, this system can accommodate more users than the others and a better spectrum efficiency can be achieved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869921","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Performance of FFH-GMSK signals with centre sampling double differential detection in frequency-selective Rayleigh channels with CCI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of FFH-GMSK signals with centre sampling double differential detection in frequency-selective Rayleigh channels with CCI","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627211.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023061S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","articleId":"627211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":627214,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Based on random coding techniques we analyze the performance of binary block codes on such channels. New upper and lower bounds to the error probability are derived. The new upper bound, that is tighter than previously known results, reveals that the maximum diversity order achieved in a block fading channel with finite interleaving is dictated not only by the number of diversity channels L but also by the code rate R, and that the performance can be only marginally improved by increasing the block length of the code. Furthermore, it was found that low rate codes can effectively exploit the available diversity. For diversity order of L, codes of rate 1/L are in particular advantageous. The gains over conventional diversity schemes are shown to be significant (3-6 dB). Examples of systems that our model can be used for are the GSM or PCS1900, and the ATDMA proposal for UMTS. These systems employ slow frequency hopping TDMA.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627214","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627214.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","startPage":"494","endPage":"499 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coded diversity schemes on block fading Rayleigh channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Coded diversity schemes on block fading Rayleigh channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627214/","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869924","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coded diversity schemes on block fading Rayleigh channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056075S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"17","articleId":"627214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":627215,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

While, there have been many studies showing the capacity gains of CDMA over narrowband TDMA systems, most of these studies assume a uniform distribution of the user population across the coverage area. When compared to the more general case of non-uniform user distributions, the uniform user distribution leads to lower multi-user interference and consequently higher system capacity. Hence, use of these models can lead to overestimation of system capacity. Three non-uniform user density models are developed and used to analyze the system's performance in typical CDMA implementation scenarios. The results indicate that intra-cell multi-user interference dominates the total interference levels in most cases. As expected cell splitting is shown to improve the system performance. The most significant improvements in performance with cell-splitting are seen for a Gaussian user density model (when compared to linear or exponential user density models). The results provide additional insight into the performance of CDMA systems, and are useful for the purposes of network planning and resource allocation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of non-uniform traffic distributions on performance of a cellular CDMA system","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627234","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627234.pdf","startPage":"598","endPage":"602 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627234","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627234/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Effect of non-uniform traffic distributions on performance of a cellular CDMA system","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869944","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of non-uniform traffic distributions on performance of a cellular CDMA system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627234.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026541S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"14","articleId":"627234","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":627235,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Myung Lee","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommnications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Dong Myung Lee","id":"37620141900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3777-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-8442"}],"articleNumber":"627235","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":21},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Base stations","Multiaccess communication","Performance analysis","Analytical models","Delay estimation","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Collision mitigation","Delay effects","Telecommunication traffic","Traffic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","land mobile radio","packet radio networks","channel capacity","digital simulation","probability","telecommunication traffic","telecommunication network routing","queueing theory","cellular radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["performance simulation","base station","simulation results","analytical results","bottleneck","simulation model","objective factors","blocking probability","utilization ratio","delay time","traffic channel elements","interconnection network","packet router","base transceiver subsystem","transcoding channels","queueing network model","mobile cellular network"]}],"abstract":"The performance of call capacity for the base station (BS) in the CDMA mobile system (CMS) is analyzed, and the simulation results are compared with the analytical results.

The generated orthogonal multi-SF codes have a tree structure. A group spreading modulator which simplifies the base station transmitter structure is also described. The forward link transmission performances under multiuser and frequency selective Rayleigh fading environments are evaluated by computer simulation to show that performance identical to that achieved by using multiple orthogonal codes in parallel can be achieved.

The proposed scheme can be applied to the case where the reverse link capacity is enough, but all traffic channels are in a busy state. The proposed scheme takes advantage of the feature of soft handoff in which a mobile station holds its communication link even if one of the two communication links is released. The scheme estimates the mean and variance of the total received power level measured at the BS before assigning a traffic channel for a new call request. The BS makes a decision based on the estimated values whether the new call request will be accepted or not. If it is decided that the capacity of the reverse radio link is enough, but the traffic channel is not available, then the BS increases the value of the soft handoff parameter T_DROP to release the traffic channel of mobile stations located in the soft handoff area. The BS assigns the released traffic channel to a new call or a handoff call. The performance of the proposed channel assignment scheme is evaluated by computer simulation. The results show that the call blocking rate for new calls and handoff calls is reduced.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627242","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627242.pdf","startPage":"637","endPage":"641 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A channel assignment scheme for reducing call blocking rate in a DS-CDMA cellular system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627242/","displayDocTitle":"A channel assignment scheme for reducing call blocking rate in a DS-CDMA cellular system","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869952","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A channel assignment scheme for reducing call blocking rate in a DS-CDMA cellular system","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02949S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"11","articleId":"627242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":627243,"authors":[{"name":"S.K.

For interference limited systems, perfect MRC RAKE receivers can accommodate about 5m/(5m-1) more users than EGC RAKE receivers, where m is the Nakagami fading parameter. MRC has a higher rate of improvement than EGC as the number of combined paths increases. However, imperfect or inaccurate channel fading estimation leads to serious degradation in the performance of MRC receivers and in that case EGC becomes superior to MRC.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627256.pdf","startPage":"708","endPage":"712 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627256","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAKE reception with maximal-ratio and equal-gain combining for DS-CDMA systems in Nakagami fading","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Diversity reception","Multiaccess communication","Fading","Bit error rate","Multipath channels","Degradation","RAKE receivers","Frequency","Transmitters","Power system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","spread spectrum communication","fading","radio receivers","land mobile radio","diversity reception"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RAKE reception","maximal-ratio combining","equal-gain combining","DS-CDMA systems","coherent binary direct-sequence code division multiple access","frequency-selective Nakagami fading channels","performance comparison","RAKE receivers","EGC","MRC","interference limited systems","combined paths","channel fading estimation","degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"RAKE reception with maximal-ratio and equal-gain combining for DS-CDMA systems in Nakagami fading","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869966","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RAKE reception with maximal-ratio and equal-gain combining for DS-CDMA systems in Nakagami fading","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627256.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06959S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"18","articleId":"627256","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":627271,"authors":[{"name":"Zhang Yongsheng","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Yongsheng","id":"37062667900"},{"name":"Li Daoben","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, China"],"lastName":"Li Daoben","id":"37428322700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3777-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-8442"}],"articleNumber":"627271","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":14},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power control","Programmable control","Adaptive control","Multiaccess communication","Rayleigh channels","Fading","Frequency","Downlink","AWGN","Adaptive filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","power control","telecommunication control","adaptive filters","fading","multipath channels","correlation methods","Rayleigh channels","channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA/TDD system","open-loop power control","multipath fading channel","nonlinear adaptive prediction filters","linear adaptive prediction filters","computer simulations","Volterra based nonlinear filter","optimum performance","Rayleigh fading"]}],"abstract":"An open-loop power control scheme in the CDMA/TDD system is presented, which is based on the adaptive prediction of the multipath fading channel.

In the present paper we focus on successive decoding DS-CDMA systems. By successively decoding the strongest user and canceling it from the received signal in decreasing received power order, the in-cell interference is minimized. In a multicellular environment, the other-cell interference can be greatly reduced by employing the proposed power control scheme. The simplified analytical model has shown a reverse-link capacity gain of 2.26 over the conventional DS-CDMA system, under the assumptions of no lognormal shadowing, uniform user density, and taking a deterministic number of active users based on the mean voice activity level. With added complexity of lognormal shadowing, binomially distributed active users, the detailed simulation model has shown a capacity gain of 2 over the conventional system. Both models are under the assumption of perfect interference cancellation and negligible decoding errors.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627273","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627273.pdf","startPage":"800","endPage":"804 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity improvement of an integrated successive decoding and power control scheme","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627273","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627273/","displayDocTitle":"The capacity improvement of an integrated successive decoding and power control scheme","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869983","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity improvement of an integrated successive decoding and power control scheme","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033091S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","citationCount":"16","articleId":"627273","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":627274,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Many different behaviors of the system result from its statistical nature. Since DS-CDMA is an averaging method, In a qualitative discussion about it, the average behavior of the system is usually considered. But, the capacity criterion is usually the 1st percentile of the 'C/I' (carrier to interference ratio) distribution function. This criterion is a function of both the mean and the variance of C/I. Any parameter which increases the randomness of the system, increases the variance and decreases the capacity of the system with the same 'C/I' mean. The most important effects of this fact are: (i) dividing the available spectrum into sub-channels reduces the total capacity of the system, (ii) the capacity improvement due to the voice activity is less than 1/(VoiceActivity), (iii) in the downtown of big cities with tall buildings, the capacity is lower.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical nature of behavior and performance of DS-CDMA cellular mobile communications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627275","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627275.pdf","startPage":"809","endPage":"812 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627275","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Statistical nature of behavior and performance of DS-CDMA cellular mobile communications","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869985","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical nature of behavior and performance of DS-CDMA cellular mobile communications","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048862S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","articleId":"627275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":627276,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.R.

These cause fading especially within chip durations of DS-CDMA systems. We propose modified Wiener beamforming (MWB) to co-phase the multipath components then combine them using maximum ratio combining within a chip duration. We derive formulas for MWB with a method to separate and estimate multipath vectors through each chip. We aim to isolate and recombine multipath components before they add together as a phasor to generate fading. Therefore the fading of Rayleigh or Rician distributed multipath within each chip duration can be reduced to a minimum. Simulation results are presented by using a three dimensional ray tracing to support the proposed method.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","startPage":"823","endPage":"827 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627278.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modified Wiener beamforming for indoor multipath channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627278/","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Modified Wiener beamforming for indoor multipath channels","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869988","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modified Wiener beamforming for indoor multipath channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057797S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","articleId":"627278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":627279,"authors":[{"name":"Suk-Hyon Yoon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Suk-Hyon Yoon","id":"37366691100"},{"name":"Young-Jo Lee","affiliation":["LG R&D Center, LGIC Limited, Anyang, Kyunggi, South Korea"],"lastName":"Young-Jo Lee","id":"37337185900"},{"name":"Sung-Jin Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung-Jin Kang","id":"37066335200"},{"name":"Tae-Hyun Moon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Tae-Hyun Moon","id":"37608731100"},{"name":"Chang-Eon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chang-Eon Kang","id":"37276354400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-3777-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1091-8442"}],"articleNumber":"627279","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":51},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Antenna arrays","Diversity methods","Phased arrays","Array signal processing","Wireless networks","Equalizers","Fading","Multipath channels","Performance analysis","Timing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","adaptive antenna arrays","array signal processing","time-domain analysis","cellular radio","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spatial-temporal diversity technique","fractionally-spaced adaptive array antenna","array process","wireless network","spatial diversity method","system capacity","equalizer","timing phase","antenna","FS antenna array system","poly-phase filter","time-domain","space-domain","symbol-spaced array antenna","FS array antenna"]}],"abstract":"For the array processing in a wireless network a spatial diversity method is used to increase the system capacity.

Both OCDMA and SFH/TDMA are small cell, low mobility systems without low-rate speech coding and other complex baseband signal processing. Further, time division duplexing (TDD) rather than frequency division duplexing (FDD) is used. Both systems have the same number of channels, system bandwidth, cell layout and voice activity detection. Following the investigations, we have found that OCDMA and SFH/TDMA are very much the same on the basis of capacity. However, SFH/TDMA is more robust to unintentional interference than OCDMA in an unlicensed environment because of easier channel switching and stronger signal-to-noise ratio under stronger jammers.","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627285","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of ICUPC 97 - 6th International Conference on Universal Personal Communications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4940/13615/00627285.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"863 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1997.627285","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13615","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of orthogonal CDMA and slow frequency hopping (SFH)/TDMA for picocell communications on the basis of spectral efficiency and robustness","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627285","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627285/","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of orthogonal CDMA and slow frequency hopping (SFH)/TDMA for picocell communications on the basis of spectral efficiency and robustness","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5869995","conferenceDate":"12-16 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of orthogonal CDMA and slow frequency hopping (SFH)/TDMA for picocell communications on the basis of spectral efficiency and robustness","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00627285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039417S","chronDate":"12-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4940","articleId":"627285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":627328,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The approach combines the switch-level circuit simulation and the device-level Monte Carlo simulation to achieve a realistic reliability assessment. The Monte Carlo analysis makes use of importance sampling to reduce the run lengths. Key advantages of this approach are that it can closely mimic dynamic sequences of events in a device over time, localize the weak locations/aspects of a target chip, and generate time-to-failure (TIF) distribution for an entire VLSI chip. In the current implementation, two common IC failure modes (electromigration and oxide breakdown) are simultaneously simulated under varying operating environments and fabrication technology parameters. In particular, operating voltage, temperature, and the device dimension are varied, and the impact of technology improvements, such as reduced dimension, on reliability is quantified. The use of this environment for developing reliable VLSI systems is illustrated with a case study of a custom-designed microprocessor chip.","displayPublicationTitle":"FTCS-23 The Twenty-Third International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4964/13650/00627335.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"329","publicationTitle":"FTCS-23 The Twenty-Third International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing","doi":"10.1109/FTCS.1993.627335","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTCS.1993.627335","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13650","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wear-out simulation environment for VLSI designs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Circuit simulation","Monte Carlo methods","Predictive models","Switching circuits","Electromigration","Electric breakdown","Fabrication","Voltage","Temperature"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microprocessor chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wear-out simulation environment","time to failure distribution","VLSI designs","reliability prediction","switch-level circuit simulation","device-level Monte Carlo simulation","reliability assessment","importance sampling","dynamic sequences","weak locations","electromigration","oxide breakdown","operating voltage","temperature","device dimension","reliability","custom-designed microprocessor chip"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627335/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1993","displayDocTitle":"Wear-out simulation environment for VLSI designs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4922584","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wear-out simulation environment for VLSI designs","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"00627335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13563S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1993","isNumber":"13650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4964","citationCount":"4","articleId":"627335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":627346,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

First, they extend Gray's five-minute rule, which compares the relative cost of storing data in volatile memory as against disk for read-only data, to read-write data. Second, they show that because of additional write overhead, FT-mem has a higher advantage over V-mem than previously thought. Previous studies comparing volatile and non-volatile memories have focused on the response time advantages of putting log data in non-volatile memory. The authors show that there is a direct reduction in disk I/O, which leads to a much larger savings in cost using an FT-mem buffer. Third, the five-minute model is a simple model that assumes knowledge of inter-access times for data items. The authors present a more realistic model that assumes an LRU buffer management policy. They combine this with the recovery time constraint and study the resulting price-performance. It is shown that the use of an FT-mem buffer can lead to a significant benefit in terms of overall price-performance.","doi":"10.1109/FTCS.1993.627348","startPage":"451","publicationTitle":"FTCS-23 The Twenty-Third International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"FTCS-23 The Twenty-Third International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4964/13650/00627348.pdf","endPage":"460","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FTCS.1993.627348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627348/","displayDocTitle":"A case for fault-tolerant memory for transaction processing","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4922597","publicationDate":"1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A case for fault-tolerant memory for transaction processing","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"00627348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082572S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1993","isNumber":"13650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4964","citationCount":"2","articleId":"627348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":627353,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The authors present a model for analyzing the vulnerability of systems to undetected data corruptions. The model estimates expected corruption rates based on commercial reliability studies, field experience with fault-tolerant systems, and academic fault-injection studies. They find that without lockstep, an undetected data corruption may occur nearly once per month in a population of 10,000 processors. Given the available data, however, it is difficult to provide tight bounds for the frequency of data integrity violations and the authors' current estimates of the data corruption rate vary by more than two orders of magnitude. Further study on transient failures and the impact of faults is required to narrow the range of the predictions and reduce the overall risk of undetected data corruptions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 June 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627360/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4922609","publicationDate":"1993","conferenceDate":"22-24 June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The risk of data corruption in microprocessor-based systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The risk of data corruption in microprocessor-based systems","confLoc":"Toulouse, France","sourcePdf":"00627360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074713S","chronDate":"22-24 June 1993","isNumber":"13650","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4964","citationCount":"21","articleId":"627360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":627364,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The observer is a system whose time evolution is described by a set of nonlinear differential equations. The input to the observer is a time dependent signal, assumed equal to a sum of N sinusoids, each described by a frequency, amplitude, and phase that do not change with time. An N-mode observer is designed for a nominal input composed of N modes. The observer's task is to track these three characteristics for each component mode of the input. When the actual input to the observer is indeed composed of N modes, then the frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of these modes correspond to an equilibrium point of the observer. Numerical computer simulations, supported by analytical arguments, strongly suggest that this equilibrium point is asymptotically stable and has a rather large domain of attraction. Such simulations also suggest that the observer is robust, namely, it is able to sufficiently identify the characteristics of N dominant modes when forced with an M-mode input, when M is greater than N. This is the case most likely to be encountered in practice. From the point of view of combustion instabilities, the usefulness of the observer rests on the premise that the unstable pressure oscillations in a combustion chamber be quasi-steady and have a discrete spectral content. In such a case, an N-mode observer with a large enough N could, in principle, track the frequencies, amplitudes, and phases of the individual unstable modes in real-time. The information obtained during this process can be used to cancel any time delays in the actuators, and form, in accordance with Rayleigh's criterion, the secondary feedback fuel flow for optimal damping of the instability. A preliminary version of this observer has performed this task extremely well in numerous experiments with an unstable combustor.","doi":"10.1109/CCA.1997.627762","startPage":"818","endPage":"823","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/4960/13643/00627762.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCA.1997.627762","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A procedure for real-time mode decomposition, observation, and prediction for active control of combustion instabilities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Combustion","Frequency","Differential equations","Computer simulation","Computational modeling","Robustness","Delay effects","Actuators","Feedback","Fuels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear differential equations","observers","compensation","combustion","closed loop systems","pressure control","Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decomposition","observation","prediction","active control","combustion instabilities","nonlinear observer","nonlinear differential equations","equilibrium point","domain of attraction","unstable pressure oscillations","combustion chamber","Rayleigh's criterion","secondary feedback fuel flow","optimal damping"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627762/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Oct. 1997","displayDocTitle":"A procedure for real-time mode decomposition, observation, and prediction for active control of combustion instabilities","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-7 Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5745966","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A procedure for real-time mode decomposition, observation, and prediction for active control of combustion instabilities","confLoc":"Hartford, CT, USA","sourcePdf":"00627762.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051491S","chronDate":"5-7 Oct. 1997","isNumber":"13643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4960","citationCount":"9","articleId":"627762","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":627835,"authors":[{"name":"H.

FACTS devices such as thyristor-controlled series capacitors (TCSC) are difficult to model due to their nonlinear switching behaviour. Linearizing the TCSC steady-state average model is inadequate as this does not model the passive damping associated with the open-loop operation of a TCSC. The proposed approach exploits the fact that the thyristor controlled reactor associated with the TCSC is switched in a regular pattern. A linear model is obtained by linearizing the half-period map associated with sampling the TCSC capacitor voltage twice every cycle. Such an approach models the passive damping which varies with the steady-state conduction angle of the TCSC. It is shown that passive damping has a significant effect on the modal damping of the torsional modes associated with subsynchronous resonance phenomena.","doi":"10.1109/59.627867","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.627867","startPage":"1619","endPage":"1625","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/13647/00627867.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic modeling of a TCSC with application to SSR analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic modeling of a TCSC with application to SSR analysis","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5749368","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627867/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic modeling of a TCSC with application to SSR analysis","sourcePdf":"00627867.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035298S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"57","articleId":"627867","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":627870,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The load patterns of each test customer during different seasons are solved by statistical analysis according to the load information collected. The seasonal typical load pattern of each customer class is then determined by integrating the load patterns of the same type customers. The power consumption of the customer class is then estimated by the typical class load pattern and the energy consumption of all customers in the same class, which can be retrieved from the customer information database.

This paper concentrates on the solution methodology for hydro subproblems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydro constraints. Continuous reservoir dynamics and constraints, discontinuous operating regions, discrete operating states and hydraulic coupling of cascaded reservoirs are considered in an integrated fashion. The key idea is to substitute out the reservoir dynamics and to relax the reservoir level constraints by using another set of multipliers, making a hydro subproblem unit-wise and stage-wise decomposable. The optimal generation level for each operating state at each hour can be obtained simply by minimizing a single variable function. Dynamic programming is then applied to optimize the operating states across the planning horizon with a small number of well structured transitions. A modified subgradient algorithm is used to update multipliers. After the dual problem converges, the feasible solution to the hydropower subsystem is obtained by using a network flow algorithm, with operating states obtained in the dual solutions, and possibly adjusted by heuristics. Numerical testing based on practical system data sets show that this method is efficient and effective for dealing with hydrothermal power systems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydroelectric constraints.","doi":"10.1109/59.627890","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.627890","startPage":"1775","endPage":"1780","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/13647/00627890.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13647","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimization-based algorithm for scheduling hydrothermal power systems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydro constraints","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1997","displayDocTitle":"An optimization-based algorithm for scheduling hydrothermal power systems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydro constraints","publicationDate":"Nov. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"12","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5749391","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627890/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimization-based algorithm for scheduling hydrothermal power systems with cascaded reservoirs and discrete hydro constraints","sourcePdf":"00627890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04776S","chronDate":"Nov.  1997","isNumber":"13647","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"71","articleId":"627890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":627970,"authors":[{"name":"B.

A database of 500 fully diagnosed ECG records was used to develop the ROC curves for all possible combinations of disease conditions. Results demonstrated that PSD parameters derived from the X lead were generally the most sensitive discriminators between infarcts and ventricular hypertrophies, and were generally more sensitive than parameters derived from DWT decomposition. Surprisingly, neither PSD or DWT parameters provided as good discrimination between normal and abnormal records as did simple scalar lead parameters. A feedforward neural net trained with backpropagation to discriminate between normal and abnormal records was provided with the ten most discriminating parameters in each of the four parameter sets as input. Best results (84.4% correct classification) were obtained for the scalar lead parameters. The worst result (76.6%) was obtained for the continuous PSD. The parameters selected were in general highly discriminating between individual disease conditions and were not optimal for the classification of normal/abnormal records.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selection of parameters from power spectral density, wavelet transforms and other methods for the automated interpretation of the ECG","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.627970","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13644/00627970.pdf","startPage":"71","endPage":"74 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.627970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=627970","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/627970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Selection of parameters from power spectral density, wavelet transforms and other methods for the automated interpretation of the ECG","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5876417","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selection of parameters from power spectral density, wavelet transforms and other methods for the automated interpretation of the ECG","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00627970.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0541S","chronDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","citationCount":"4","articleId":"627970","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":627974,"authors":[{"name":"Poh Lian Choong","affiliation":["Centre for Iiitelligeiit Inforination Processing Systems Department of' Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia"],"lastName":"Poh Lian Choong","id":"37087210440"},{"name":"C.J.S. deSilva","affiliation":["Centre for Iiitelligeiit Inforination Processing Systems Department of' Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, WA, Australia","University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, AU"],"firstName":"C.J.S.","lastName":"deSilva","id":"37327423800"},{"name":"Y.

That is, the new block adaptive algorithm is mathematically equivalent to the LMS-DFE algorithm (and hence it features identical performance).

A multiresolution neural network approach to supervised classification is presented, exploiting the inherent fuzziness of such techniques in order to perform classification at different resolution levels and gain in computational complexity. In particular, multiresolution image analysis is carried out and hierarchical neural networks are used as an efficient architecture for classification of the derived multiresolution image representations. A new scheme is then introduced for transferring classification results to higher resolution based on the fuzziness of the results of lower resolutions, resulting in faster implementation. Experimental results on land cover mapping applications from remotely sensed data illustrate significant improvements in classification speed without deterioration of representation accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628055","startPage":"261","endPage":"264 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13644/00628055.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy image classification using multiresolution neural networks with applications to remote sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Image classification","Image resolution","Neural networks","Testing","Performance gain","Computational complexity","Image analysis","Computer architecture","Image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image classification","image representation","image resolution","fuzzy neural nets","remote sensing","geophysical signal processing","unsupervised learning","feedforward neural nets","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy image classification","multiresolution neural networks","remote sensing applications","supervised image classification research","training","allocation","testing","resolution levels","computational complexity","multiresolution image analysis","hierarchical neural networks","multiresolution image representations","experimental results","land cover mapping applications","remotely sensed data","classification speed","representation accuracy","feedforward neural nets"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy image classification using multiresolution neural networks with applications to remote sensing","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","accessionNumber":"5876454","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy image classification using multiresolution neural networks with applications to remote sensing","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00628055.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0548S","chronDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","citationCount":"3","articleId":"628055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":628058,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Referring to the European GSM mobile radio system, an approach based on automatic tracking of the channel variations based on the use of neural networks (NN) is presented which exhibits good bit error rate (BER) performance is presented. The NN architecture employed is a modification of Kohonen's (1988) self organizing map (SOM) with a recursive structure (output folded to the input). This dynamic network performs classification by vector quantization of the input stream using the information contained in the middamble of the GSM burst with an unsupervised control scheme. The neural receiver is demonstrated to converge very quickly to stability and to have a lower computational complexity than the Viterbi algorithm.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13644/00628066.pdf","startPage":"287","endPage":"290 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628066","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628066","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-linear mobile-radio channel estimation using neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628066/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 1997","displayDocTitle":"Non-linear mobile-radio channel estimation using neural networks","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5876460","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-linear mobile-radio channel estimation using neural networks","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00628066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056525S","chronDate":"2-4 July 1997","isNumber":"13644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","citationCount":"3","articleId":"628066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":628068,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The chip rate is equal to 12.5 M chips/s and the spreading factor is fixed at 31.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13644/00628105.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"370 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13644","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-time diversity receiver for DS-CDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Transmitters","Interference","Sensor systems","Fading","Delay effects","Frequency","Oscilloscopes","Matched filters","Laboratories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum communication","land mobile radio","cochannel interference","interference suppression","diversity reception","radio receivers","fading","antenna arrays","monopole antennas","code division multiple access","telecommunication channels","adaptive signal processing","array signal processing","direction-of-arrival estimation","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DS-CDMA systems","space-time diversity receiver","filter length","signal scenarios","multi-user scenario","single user scenario","fading effects","cochannel interference","antennas array","monopole","chip rate","spreading factor","measured data","channel impulse response","interference rejection","mobile radio","blind adaptive beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628105/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Space-time diversity receiver for DS-CDMA systems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5876470","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-time diversity receiver for DS-CDMA systems","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00628105.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058646S","chronDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","articleId":"628105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":628110,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, we investigate the optimum and a simplified smart antenna concept for a time-slotted CDMA mobile radio system termed joint detection CDMA (JD-CDMA). These new combined direction of arrival and channel estimation algorithms and the conventional detection scheme are evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations. They reveal that significant performance improvements can be achieved by exploiting relationships between the estimated directions of arrival and the channel impulse response vectors. Compared to the optimum solution, the new suboptimum approach offers a considerable reduction of the signal processing complexity without severe degradations of the system's performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628110","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13644/00628110.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"378 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-user direction of arrival and channel estimation for time-slotted CDMA with joint detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628110/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-user direction of arrival and channel estimation for time-slotted CDMA with joint detection","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5876472","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-user direction of arrival and channel estimation for time-slotted CDMA with joint detection","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00628110.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050456S","chronDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","citationCount":"5","articleId":"628110","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":628115,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

These methods exploit the cyclostationarity induced by a filter-bank structure at the transmitter to identify FIR nonminimum phase channels without higher-order statistics or fractional-sampling. As an example, OFDM systems are considered with and without the cyclic prefix. Some redundancy, independent of the channel memory is shown to be necessary for OFDM and other orthonormal transformation systems for blind channel identification. Methods of blind channel estimation for more general transform modulations are also supported in this framework. Monte Carlo simulations are used to provide examples of performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628115","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13644/00628115.pdf","startPage":"383","endPage":"386 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel identification for multirate precoding and OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628115/","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel identification for multirate precoding and OFDM systems","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5876474","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel identification for multirate precoding and OFDM systems","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00628115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038955S","chronDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13644","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","citationCount":"5","articleId":"628115","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":628116,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Any number of faulty CLBs in the chip can be detected.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple fault detection in logic resources of FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/DFTVS.1997.628324","startPage":"186","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DFTVS.1997.628324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13649","publicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"1997 IEEE International Symposium on Defect and Fault Tolerance in VLSI Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/4962/13649/00628324.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628324/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Multiple fault detection in logic resources of FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5801673","conferenceDate":"20-22 Oct. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple fault detection in logic resources of FPGAs","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"00628324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047296S","chronDate":"20-22 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4962","citationCount":"10","articleId":"628324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":628336,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In the literature, lower bounds are generally obtained by computing lower bounds on the bisection width or the crossing number of the network being laid out. In this paper, we define a new measure that we call \"maximal congestion\", that can be used to obtain both the bisection width and the crossing number, thereby unifying the two approaches. Upper bounds are traditionally obtained by constructing layouts based on separators or bifurcators. Both methods have the basic limitation that they are applicable only for graphs with bounded vertex degree. The separators approach generally yields good layouts when good separators can be found, but it is difficult to find a good separator for an arbitrary graph. The bifurcators approach is easier to apply, but it generally yields larger area and wire lengths. We show how to obtain \"strong separators\" as well as bifurcators for any homogeneous product network, as long as the factor graph has bounded vertex degree. We illustrate application of both methods to layout a number of interesting product networks. Furthermore, we introduce a new layout method for product networks based on the combination of collinear layouts. This method is more powerful than the two methods above because it is applicable even when the factor graph has unbounded vertex degree. It also yields smaller area than the earlier methods. In fact, our method has led to the optimal area for all of the homogeneous product networks we considered in this paper with one exception, which is very close to optimal. In regards to wire lengths, the results obtained by our method turned out to be the best of the three methods for all the examples we considered, again subject to one (and the same) exception. We give an extensive variety of such examples.","doi":"10.1109/12.628392","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1070","endPage":"1082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/12/13670/00628392.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.628392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13670","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient VLSI layouts for homogeneous product networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Particle separators","Bifurcation","Wire","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Routing","Hypercubes","Partitioning algorithms","Computer networks","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessor interconnection networks","VLSI","circuit layout CAD","computational complexity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI layouts","homogeneous product networks","VLSI complexity","lower bounds","upper bounds","maximal congestion","bifurcators approach","bifurcators","factor graph"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Efficient VLSI layouts for homogeneous product networks","volume":"46","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5742162","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628392/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient VLSI layouts for homogeneous product networks","sourcePdf":"00628392.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027091S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"20","articleId":"628392","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":628397,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The conversion procedure is performed in the following three levels: residue to signed-digit, signed-digit to binary, end-around carry addition/subtraction. In the first level of operation, the signed-digit representation of the CRT equation is realized by using redundant adder/subtracter blocks. Here, the necessary embedded multiplications are replaced by simple shift-left operations and the carry propagation is totally eliminated. In the second level, the redundant representation of CRT is directly converted to binary format. Finally, an end-around carry (EAC) addition/subtraction is performed to obtain the result at the third level of operation. The proposed architectures are simple, fast, free of memory blocks and module adders.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/12/13670/00628400.pdf","startPage":"1146","endPage":"1150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A signed-digit architecture for residue to binary transformation","doi":"10.1109/12.628400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13670","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.628400","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"A signed-digit architecture for residue to binary transformation","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5742170","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signed-digit architecture for residue to binary transformation","sourcePdf":"00628400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043525S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13670","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","articleId":"628400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":628413,"authors":[{"name":"T.

There is no need for creating a new database in the desired working environment. Our method was tested on a vowel spotting system, and is trained with two well known databases: TIMIT and NTIMIT.

For the latter family, we have introduced a measure of the spectral alias between subbands introduced by the filters and have evaluated it for several filter banks. From the preliminary experimental results, by simulating a complete coding process on a set of test images, it appears that this measure could help the designer to predict the performance of a given filter bank.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13653/00628429.pdf","startPage":"633","endPage":"636 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628429","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628429","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Filter evaluation for wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wavelet transforms","Nonlinear filters","Filter bank","Low pass filters","Matched filters","Image coding","Polynomials","Video coding","Image resolution","Signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","transform coding","wavelet transforms","filtering theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transform","video coding","filter banks","spectral alias","filter evaluation","biorthogonal filters","orthogonal filters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628429/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Filter evaluation for wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5876780","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Filter evaluation for wavelet transform","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00628429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093379S","chronDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","articleId":"628429","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":628431,"authors":[{"name":"D.

They are fast and programmable, thus supporting adaptive stack filtering in real time. An arbitrary stack filter (i.e., filter based on any positive Boolean function) of given window size M is realizable on this architecture in constant time. The architecture is simple without long connections or feedback loops. A new VLSI implementation of order statistic filtering is proposed. Simulations verify the high-speed functionality of the device.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13653/00628431.pdf","startPage":"641","endPage":"644 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628431","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628431","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13653","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628431","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI architecture for stack filters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","Filtering","Statistics","Computer architecture","Samarium","Adaptive filters","Digital filters","Boolean functions","CMOS technology","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI","adaptive filters","digital filters","adaptive signal processing","CMOS digital integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI architecture","stack filters","real-time filtering","efficient algorithms","programmable architecture","adaptive stack filtering","window size","order statistic filtering","simulations","CMOS technology","positive Boolean functions"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628431/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"VLSI architecture for stack filters","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5876782","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI architecture for stack filters","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00628431.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04074S","chronDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","citationCount":"4","articleId":"628431","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":628454,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A smaller estimation error is obtained for the neural network, when it is trained with a sigmoid-like scaled output vector than when it is trained with a linear or nonlinear scaled ones. The most populated region in the output vector domain is determined accordingly through investigation of the nature of the problem to be solved. Through a vector scaling technique in which the nature of the problem is incorporated, one can assign more resolution to a more populated region of the output vector domain. The neural network trained with a set of scaled output vectors results in a more accurate estimation of the output vector, with increased resolution when recall or generalisation is carried out. Results indicate that if the nature of the problem is suitable, the technique can also speed up convergence. The technique is applied to estimate the control parameters of an articulatory speech synthesizer.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628454","startPage":"723","endPage":"726 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13653","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13653/00628454.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving neural network learning through output vector scaling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628454/","displayDocTitle":"Improving neural network learning through output vector scaling","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5876801","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving neural network learning through output vector scaling","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00628454.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049601S","chronDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","citationCount":"1","articleId":"628454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":628455,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The results provide a new insight into the analysis of different methods for reconstructing signals from their spectral transform.","doi":"10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDSP.1997.628466","startPage":"773","endPage":"776 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel3/4961/13653/00628466.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 13th International Conference on Digital Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal signal reconstruction from spectral amplitude","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","displayDocTitle":"Optimal signal reconstruction from spectral amplitude","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 1997","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"5876810","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628466/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal signal reconstruction from spectral amplitude","confLoc":"Santorini, Greece","sourcePdf":"00628466.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027933S","chronDate":"2-4 Jul 1997","isNumber":"13653","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4961","citationCount":"4","articleId":"628466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":628514,"authors":[{"name":"S.G.

For instance, a single bit error in a coded video bitstream may cause severe degradation on picture quality. When bit errors occur during transmission and cannot be corrected by an error correction scheme, error concealment is needed to conceal the corrupted image at the receiver. Error concealment algorithms attempt to repair damaged portions of the picture by exploiting both the spatial and the temporal redundancies in the received and reconstructed video signal. We discuss several temporal, spatial, and transform-domain error concealment techniques for MPEG coded pictures, and propose a new scheme based on directional interpolation. We also compare the performance of these techniques by computer simulation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error concealment based on directional interpolation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.628616","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/30/13676/00628616.pdf","startPage":"295","endPage":"302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.628616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"Error concealment based on directional interpolation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712687","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error concealment based on directional interpolation","sourcePdf":"00628616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029383S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"115","articleId":"628616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":628649,"authors":[{"name":"Young Huh","affiliation":["Power Telecomm.

One of the characteristics of an OFDM-QAM signal is its wide range of envelope fluctuation: its crest factor, defined as the ratio of the peak instantaneous power to the average (rms) power in dB, is typically greater than 10. When an OFDM-QAM signal drives a nonlinear device, nonlinearity will result in signal compression and intermodulation among the sub-carriers at the output. An analytical method is used to predict the input back-off needed to keep the intermodulation below an acceptable level. For sufficient large number of sub-carriers, we show that to keep the intermodulation power 30 dB below the signal power, we need to back-off the input power by 6.5 dB. However, from the BER point of view, the degradation is less than 2 dB at BER=0.01% even for 1 dB input back-off.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/30/13676/00628655.pdf","startPage":"443","endPage":"447","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doi":"10.1109/30.628655","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.628655","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of nonlinearity on a QPSK-OFDM-QAM signal","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency modulation","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Amplitude modulation","Quadrature phase shift keying","Signal to noise ratio","Linearity","Signal analysis","Bit error rate","Degradation","Broadcasting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature phase shift keying","frequency division multiplexing","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal processing","intermodulation distortion","coding errors","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QPSK-OFDM-QAM signal","nonlinearity","envelope fluctuation","peak instantaneous power","crest factor","average power","ratio","RMS power","nonlinear device","signal compression","subcarriers","analytical method","input back-off","intermodulation power","signal power","input power","BER"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"The effect of nonlinearity on a QPSK-OFDM-QAM signal","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712708","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of nonlinearity on a QPSK-OFDM-QAM signal","sourcePdf":"00628655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047381S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"10","articleId":"628655","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":628669,"authors":[{"name":"R.P.

This algorithm is capable of finding the correspondences between input minutiae and the stored template without resorting to exhaustive search and has the ability to compensate adaptively for the nonlinear deformations and inexact transformations between an input and a template. To establish an objective assessment of our system, both the Michigan State University and the National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST 9 fingerprint data bases have been used to estimate the performance numbers. The experimental results reveal that our system can achieve a good performance on these data bases. We also have demonstrated that our system satisfies the response-time requirement.

The most important features of our LSI are its very small area and low power. In addition, this design can be used as a core module in an LSI library. The QAM demodulator has four modes of operations: 4, 16, 32, and 64 mode. The QAM demodulation is performed entirely in the digital domain. The FEC decoder includes frame synchronization, convolutional deinterleaving, RS (Reed-Solomon) decoding, and descrambling. We have achieved a small area and low power by using the following three methods. First, we adopted an ESGDD (enhanced stop & go decision-directed) algorithm as an AFC (automatic frequency control)/APC (automatic phase control) algorithm. The ESGDD algorithm which we developed based on the SGDD (stop & go decision-directed) algorithm which is a modified LMS (least mean square) algorithm, that is generally used for equalization. This new algorithm does not need an NCO (numerically controlled oscillator) operation which is usually indispensable when performing the AFC/APC algorithm. Next, we took advantage of the SGDD algorithm's sub-sampling method to perform equalization. This method can reduce the amount of the equalizing calculation. Finally, we optimized the EAB (Euclid algorithm block) in the RS decoding block, which lead to the reduction needed to perform the number of steps of the RS decoding.","doi":"10.1109/30.628690","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/30/13676/00628690.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"654","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.628690","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An area effective 1-chip QAM LSI for digital CATV","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628690","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628690/","displayDocTitle":"An area effective 1-chip QAM LSI for digital CATV","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712738","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An area effective 1-chip QAM LSI for digital CATV","sourcePdf":"00628690.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067026S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"2","articleId":"628690","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":628705,"authors":[{"name":"Heejin Roh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Communications Systems Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Heejin Roh","id":"37619272000"},{"name":"Kyungwhoon Cheun","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, Communications Systems Laboratory, Pohang University of Science and Technology, Pohang, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyungwhoon Cheun","id":"37294128700"},{"name":"Jaehong Park","affiliation":["Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jaehong Park","id":"37441557600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0098-3063"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-4127"}],"articleNumber":"628705","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":210},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Consumer Electronics Society","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/soc/ces/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency synchronization","OFDM","Timing","Cost function","Blind equalizers","Hardware","Computer simulation","Performance evaluation","Quadrature phase shift keying","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","synchronisation","frequency division multiplexing","quadrature phase shift keying","quadrature amplitude modulation","multipath channels","adjacent channel interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE fine carrier frequency synchronization algorithm","OFDM systems","minimum mean-squared error approach","symbol timing offsets","cost function","constant modulus algorithm","blind channel equalization","transmission efficiency","hardware efficient version","computer simulations","performance","QPSK","64-QAM modulations","frequency selective multipath channel","interchannel interference"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we describe a patent pending, fine carrier frequency synchronization algorithm based on a minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) approach for OFDM systems which is insensitive to symbol timing offsets.

After these algorithms were analyzed under a common statistical decision framework, they were evaluated experimentally on four individual data bases, each with a moderate subject size, and a combined data base with more than a hundred different subjects. Analysis and experimental results indicate that the eigenface algorithm, which is essentially a minimum distance classifier, works well when lighting variation is small. Its performance deteriorates significantly as lighting variation increases. The elastic matching algorithm, on the other hand, is insensitive to lighting, face position, and expression variations and therefore is more versatile. The performance of the autoassociation and classification nets is upper bounded by that of the eigenface but is more difficult to implement in practice.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Face recognition: eigenface, elastic matching, and neural nets","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/5.628712","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/13673/00628712.pdf","startPage":"1423","endPage":"1435","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.628712","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13673","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628712","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628712/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1997","displayDocTitle":"Face recognition: eigenface, elastic matching, and neural nets","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"85","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5714226","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Face recognition: eigenface, elastic matching, and neural nets","sourcePdf":"00628712.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034448S","chronDate":"Sept.  1997","isNumber":"13673","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"231","articleId":"628712","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":628714,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

The linearity of variants of the basic form is excellent, providing two-tone intermodulation intercepts as high as +30 dBm, without the expenditure of high bias currents. It can operate on supplies as low as 2.2 V, with a power consumption of under 5 mW.

This new concept uses a modified multipopulation coevolutionary genetic algorithm (MMCGA), that receives the video objects of segmented reference images, and outputs the corresponding motion and layer information, using object and layer genotypes. Genetic operation strategies of reproduction, crossover, mutation, and dominance are applied recurrently in order to create successive generations of genomes with much better fitness, until convergence, or the maximum allowed number of generations is reached. For the increase of prediction accuracy and convergence speed, a lifetime fitness strategy is used. Simulations with synthetic images have shown very encouraging results with the proposed video motion estimation technique, which competes favorably with respect to the conventional algorithms in accuracy, effectiveness, robustness, simplicity and speed.","doi":"10.1109/30.628754","startPage":"886","endPage":"895","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/30/13676/00628754.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/30.628754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new object motion estimation technique for video images, based on a genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Motion estimation","Video compression","Convergence","Bit rate","Image coding","Genetic algorithms","Image segmentation","Genetic mutations","Genomics","Bioinformatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video coding","data compression","motion estimation","convergence of numerical methods","genetic algorithms","image segmentation","image representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object motion estimation technique","video images","genetic algorithm","low bit rate image compression","low bit rate image representation","video motion estimation technique","video object translation","video object rotation","planar multilayering","modified multipopulation coevolutionary genetic algorithm","segmented reference images","layer information","motion information","layer genotypes","object genotypes","genetic operation","reproduction","crossover","lifetime fitness strategy","dominance","prediction accuracy","convergence speed","mutation","simulations","synthetic images"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628754/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1997","displayDocTitle":"A new object motion estimation technique for video images, based on a genetic algorithm","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5712771","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new object motion estimation technique for video images, based on a genetic algorithm","sourcePdf":"00628754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04153S","chronDate":"Aug 1997","isNumber":"13676","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"30","citationCount":"6","articleId":"628754","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":628757,"authors":[{"name":"S.P.

The most commonly used techniques are based on regressions or other statistical methods. An emerging tool in rainfall estimation using satellite data is artificial neural networks (NNs), NNs are mathematical models that are capable of learning complex relationships. They consist of highly interconnected, interactive data processing units. NNs are implemented in this study to estimate rainfall, and backpropagation is used as a learning scheme. The inputs for the training phase are BTs and the outputs are rainfall rates, all generated by three-dimensional (3D) simulations based on a 3D stochastic, space-time rainfall model, and a 3D radiative transfer model. Once training is complete the NNs are presented with multi-frequency and polarized (horizontal and vertical) BT data, obtained from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) instrument onboard the F10 and F11 polar-orbiting meteorological satellites. Hence, rainrates corresponding to real BT measurements are generated. The rainfall rates are also estimated using a log-linear regression model. Comparison of the two approaches, using simulated data, shows that the NN can represent more accurately the underlying relationship between BT and rainrate than the regression model, Comparison of the rates, estimated by both methods, with radar-estimated rainrates shows that NNs outperform the regression model. This study demonstrates the great potential of NNs in estimating rainfall from remotely sensed data.","doi":"10.1109/36.628775","startPage":"1079","endPage":"1093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.628775","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13674","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel3/36/13674/00628775.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network approach to estimating rainfall from spaceborne microwave data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628775/","displayDocTitle":"A neural network approach to estimating rainfall from spaceborne microwave data","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5712817","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network approach to estimating rainfall from spaceborne microwave data","sourcePdf":"00628775.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053103S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"42","articleId":"628775","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":628790,"authors":[{"name":"D.B.

The authors show that at least five observed polarization differences can be explained by local multipath interference effects that occur due to the illumination of discrete nonlinear ocean surface features, such as bores and small scale breaking waves. The illumination gain factor (IGF) is defined at a point in space, as the total power at that point relative to the power in the incident plane wave. The IGF resulting from local multipath from the sea surface forward of a discrete scatterer produces strong interference patterns that can vary both with grazing angle and scatterer height. As a result, IGF values up to a factor of 16 (12 dB) can occur for horizontal polarization (HH) when the interference is constructive; a corresponding strong cancellation occurs for destructive interference. These extreme variations can cause strong HH NRCS amplitude modulations due either to a change of local wave slope or a change of scatterer shape with time. However, Brewster angle damping of the forward scatter path for grazing angles below 20/spl deg/ occurs for vertical (VV) polarization, and reduces the VV IGF in magnitude and dynamic range, eliminating such strong modulations. This effect scales with radar wavelength, and higher wave features are required to produce equivalent effects for radar frequencies far below 10 GHz. As an illustration, six radar bands are compared: L (1.4 GHz), S (3.5 GHz), C (5 GHz), X (10 GHz), K/sub u/ (15 GHz), and K/sub a/ (35 GHz), for a sea water dielectric. X-band results indicate that 12-dB IGFs can occur for water surface features just a centimeter above the mean surface. As an application of these results, the influence of these HH and VV IGF patterns is modeled for discrete scatterers distributed uniformly along an ocean gravity wave. The dynamic range of the HH IGF for a distribution of bore scatterers up to 5 cm high is found to he significantly larger than for VV at all locations on the long wave. Moreover, the IGF HHVV polarization ratio forward of the crest, where the largest number of small scale breaking wave scatterers occurs, is larger than at all other regions of the long wave, of the order of 20 dB. These results suggest that HH polarization may be sensitive to small scale breaking features on the ocean surface at low grazing angles, and thus may be a sensitive measure of air-sea fluxes.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.628790","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel3/36/13674/00628790.pdf","startPage":"1232","endPage":"1244","doi":"10.1109/36.628790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A model for Brewster angle damping and multipath effects on the microwave radar sea echo at low grazing angles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"A model for Brewster angle damping and multipath effects on the microwave radar sea echo at low grazing angles","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5719905","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628790/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A model for Brewster angle damping and multipath effects on the microwave radar sea echo at low grazing angles","sourcePdf":"00628790.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040373S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"85","articleId":"628790","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":628792,"authors":[{"name":"Jiancheng Shi","affiliation":["Institute for Computational Earth System Science, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Jiancheng Shi","id":"37275091200"},{"name":"J.

This algorithm was applied to a series of measurements acquired at L-band (1.25 GHz) from both AIRSAR (Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and SIR-C (Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C) over a well-managed watershed in southwest Oklahoma. Prior to its application for soil moisture inversion, a good agreement was found between the single-scattering IEM simulations and the L-band measurements of SIR-C and AIRSAR over a wide range of soil moisture and surface roughness conditions. The sensitivity of soil moisture variation to the co-polarized signals were then examined under the consideration of the calibration accuracy of various components of SAR measurements. It was found that the two co-polarized backscattering coefficients and their combinations would provide the best input to the algorithm for estimation of soil moisture and roughness parameter. Application of the inversion algorithm to the co-polarized measurements of both AIRSAR and SIR-C resulted in estimated values of soil moisture and roughness parameter for bare and short-vegetated fields that compared favorably with those sampled on the ground.

It is based on detection of dark surface targets in the blue and red channels, as in previous methods, but uses the 2.1 /spl mu/m channel, instead of the 3.75 /spl mu/m for their detection. A 2.1-/spl mu/m channel is present on ADEOS OCTS and GLI and planned on EOS-MODIS and EOSP, and a similar 2.2-/spl mu/m channel is present on Landsat TM. The advantage of the 2.1-/spl mu/m channel over the 3.75-/spl mu/m channel is that it is not affected by emitted radiation. The 2.1-/spl mu/m channel is transparent to most aerosol types (except dust) and therefore can be used to detect dark surface targets. Correlation between the surface reflection in the blue (0.49 /spl mu/m), red (0.66 /spl mu/m), and 2.1 /spl mu/m is established using atmospherically corrected Landsat TM and AVIRIS aircraft images collected over the Eastern United States, Maine, and California and spectral data obtained from the ground and light aircraft near San Diego, CA. Results from a variety of surface covers show that the surface reflectance at 0.49 /spl mu/m (/spl rho//sub 0.49/) and 0.66 /spl mu/m (/spl rho//sub 0.66/) can be predicted from that at 2.2 /spl mu/m (/spl rho//sub 2.2/) within /spl Delta//spl rho/=/spl plusmn/0.06 for /spl rho//sub 2.2//spl les/0.10, using /spl rho//sub 0.49/=/spl rho//sub 2.2//4 and /spl rho//sub 0.66/=/spl rho//sub 2.2//2. Error in surface reflectance of 0.006 corresponds to an error in remote sensing of aerosol optical thickness, /spl tau/, of /spl Delta//spl tau//spl sim//spl plusmn/0.06. These relationships were validated using spectral data taken close to the surface over vegetated areas in a different biome. This method expends application of dark targets for remote sensing of aerosol to brighter, nonforested vegetation. The higher reflection of the surface at 2.2 /spl mu/m than that of 3.75 /spl mu/m may even enable remote sensing of dust above surfaces with reflectivity /spl rho//sub 2.2/=0.15/spl plusmn/0.05. For this reflectivity range the dust radiative effect at 2.2 /spl mu/m is small, and the surface reflectance in the blue and red channels can be retrieved.","doi":"10.1109/36.628795","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"1286","endPage":"1298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel3/36/13674/00628795.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.628795","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The MODIS 2.1-/spl mu/m channel-correlation with visible reflectance for use in remote sensing of aerosol","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MODIS","Reflectivity","Remote sensing","Aerosols","Satellites","Optical reflection","Aircraft","Earth","Biomedical optical imaging","Optical sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical techniques","infrared imaging","remote sensing","remote sensing","aerosols","atmospheric composition","atmospheric techniques","atmospheric optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmosphere","meteorology","optics","IR imaging","infrared method","satellite remote sensing","geophysical measurement","technique","MODIS","aerosol","correction","land surface","terrain mapping","light scattering","dark surface target","optical imaging","red channel","blue channel","2.1 mum","2.2 mum","350 to 800 nm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"The MODIS 2.1-/spl mu/m channel-correlation with visible reflectance for use in remote sensing of aerosol","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5719907","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628795/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The MODIS 2.1-/spl mu/m channel-correlation with visible reflectance for use in remote sensing of aerosol","sourcePdf":"00628795.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046226S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"578","articleId":"628795","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":628797,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Much research is needed to improve our ability to model the bidirectional reflectance distribution (BRD) for retrieving the surface information using measurements at a few angles. The geometric-optical bidirectional reflectance model presented in this paper considers four scales of canopy architecture: tree groups, tree crowns, branches and shoots. It differs from the Li-Strahler's model in the following respects: 1) the assumption of random spatial distribution of trees is replated by the Neyman distribution which is able to model the patchiness or clumpiness of a forest stand; 2) the multiple mutual shadowing effect between tree crowns is considered using a negative binomial and the Neyman distribution theory; 3) the effect of the sunlit background is modeled using a canopy gap size distribution function that affects the magnitude and width of the hotspot; 4) the branch architecture affecting the directional reflectance is simulated using a simple angular radiation penetration function; and 5) the tree crown surface is treated as a complex surface with microscale structures which themselves generate mutual shadows and a hotspot. All these scales of canopy architecture are shown to have effects on the directional distribution of the reflected radiance from conifer forests. The model results compare well with a data set from a boreal spruce forest.","doi":"10.1109/36.628798","startPage":"1316","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel3/36/13674/00628798.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.628798","endPage":"1337","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13674","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A four-scale bidirectional reflectance model based on canopy architecture","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"A four-scale bidirectional reflectance model based on canopy architecture","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"5719910","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A four-scale bidirectional reflectance model based on canopy architecture","sourcePdf":"00628798.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061187S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"333","articleId":"628798","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":628800,"authors":[{"name":"D.V.

Using a horizontal magnetic field aperture source located five cells from an absorbing boundary and 35 cells above the lossy Earth plane, the surface impedance was accurately modeled at a distance of /spl lambda//sub 0//5000 from the source using both grazing and normal incidence. The technique was validated by comparison with a number of two-dimensional (2D) analytical models. The surface impedance profile in the vicinity of a vertical conductive water filled shaft that extends from the Earth's surface to a conductive basement is presented. Unlike modeling in the frequency domain, a single FDTD solution yields accurate multi frequency surface impedance data providing a number of standard cell size constraints are met. For common Earth electrical constants, the FDTD approach is limited to frequencies above 500 Hz.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel3/36/13674/00628800.pdf","startPage":"1350","endPage":"1356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/36.628800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/36.628800","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13674","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628800","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Surface impedance modeling using the finite-difference time-domain method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface impedance","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Earth","Frequency","Magnetic field measurement","Geophysical measurements","Impedance measurement","Geophysics","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["terrestrial electricity","geophysical techniques","geophysical prospecting","finite element analysis","difference equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geology","geophysical measurement technique","prospecting method","geoelectric method","terrestrial electricity","surface impedance modelling","model","finite-difference time-domain method","finite element model","FDTD","one-dimensional surface impedance","lossy Earth plane","discontinuity","discontinuities","horizontal magnetic field aperture source","absorbing boundary","grazing incidence","normal incidence","vertical conductive water filled shaft","EM method","ELF","VLF","500 to 5000 Hz"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628800/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Surface impedance modeling using the finite-difference time-domain method","volume":"35","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5719912","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Surface impedance modeling using the finite-difference time-domain method","sourcePdf":"00628800.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103609S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13674","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"12","articleId":"628800","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":628801,"authors":[{"name":"D.V.

Because electrons have thermal energy, storing electrons in a well in a CCD register requires a sufficient potential barrier height to keep them from overflowing. As the quantity of electrons in a well depends on the barrier height, knowledge of this height is indispensable for precise estimation of the charge handling capacity. The authors have derived an expression describing the barrier height on the basis of thermionic emission, assuming current coefficient I/sub 0/ and well capacitance C. We derived the current coefficient I/sub 0/ and well capacitance C with computer simulations and from the results estimate the magnitude of the barrier height for a typical Vertical-CCD (V-CCD) structure. We have also examined barrier height dependence on structural parameters. Finally, we determined the barrier heights experimentally, and our results support the values obtained in the simulation.","doi":"10.1109/16.628808","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","startPage":"1588","endPage":"1592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/13675/00628808.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.628808","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermionic-emission-based barrier height analysis for precise estimation of charge handling capacity in CCD registers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrons","Charge coupled devices","Charge transfer","Electrodes","Image analysis","Capacitance","Charge-coupled image sensors","Thermionic emission","Computer simulation","Potential well"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thermionic electron emission","capacitance","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit modelling","CCD image sensors","shift registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["precise estimation","charge handling capacity","CCD registers","thermionic-emission-based barrier height analysis","design","charge-coupled device image sensors","thermal energy","potential barrier height","current coefficient","well capacitance","computer simulations","Vertical-CCD structure","structural parameters"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","displayDocTitle":"Thermionic-emission-based barrier height analysis for precise estimation of charge handling capacity in CCD registers","volume":"44","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5712234","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628808/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Thermionic-emission-based barrier height analysis for precise estimation of charge handling capacity in CCD registers","sourcePdf":"00628808.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027016S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"8","articleId":"628808","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":628809,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

A Monte Carlo simulation of electron thermal diffusion and field-aided drift is used to determine the time scale for charge transfer. The Monte Carlo approach is useful for exploring new problems, but it requires considerable amounts of computer time. A quicker technique, that of the mean first passage time, is introduced. This method reduces the solution of the carrier continuity equation for charge transfer to the evaluation of a double integral that yields the characteristic time /spl tau/ for e/sup -t//spl tau//. This provides the leading or dominant time dependence of the carrier continuity equation's solution. Numerical examples are presented to show how /spl tau/ varies with the size and location of the potential obstacle. The mean first passage time approach permits rapid estimates of the effects of potential obstacles on charge transfer in CCD's. These estimates are in excellent agreement with the results of the Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/16.628809","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/13675/00628809.pdf","startPage":"1593","endPage":"1598","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.628809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effect of potential obstacles on charge transfer in image sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628809/","displayDocTitle":"The effect of potential obstacles on charge transfer in image sensors","volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712235","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effect of potential obstacles on charge transfer in image sensors","sourcePdf":"00628809.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084651S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"9","articleId":"628809","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":628810,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The magnitude of signal mixing was as much as 20% for the conventional 2/3-in 2-million pixel STACK-CCD cell structure. FPN was very visible as a result of this signal mixing. This time, a new cell structure was proposed and analyzed to reduce signal mixing and FPN.

It is found that the conventional Floating Diffusion (FD) charge detection concept is inferior to the previously studied, but not frequently utilized, Floating Gate (FG) approach. A new output charge detection well reset technique and an improved biasing method allowed the design of the FG charge detection amplifier with a comparable conversion gain to FD structures but with much better noise performance at the data rates up to 40 MHz. The theoretical analysis of the FG amplifier performance, including the Correlated Pixel Clamp signal processing method, is confirmed by measurements performed on a high-resolution 1000/spl times/1000 pixel Frame Transfer CCD image sensor built using an Advanced Virtual Phase Technology. The described details of the sensor design include: (1) the over all device architecture, (2) the pixel cross section with the cross section of the lateral overflow drain antiblooming structure, (3) the dual serial register with a single output amplifier, and (4) the resistive gate reset structure for the output charge detection well. The developed image sensor does not need the conventional Correlated Double Sampling (CDS) circuit for the signal processing, since the FG detection node is sensing charge nondestructively without generation of kTC noise. The described progress in the FG charge detection approach thus opens up a possibility for future designs of distributed FG amplifiers that can theoretically reach the ultimate low-noise performance at virtually any clocking frequency.","doi":"10.1109/16.628823","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/13675/00628823.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.628823","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13675","startPage":"1679","endPage":"1688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-noise and high-speed charge detection in high-resolution CCD image sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Low-noise and high-speed charge detection in high-resolution CCD image sensors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628823/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712249","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-noise and high-speed charge detection in high-resolution CCD image sensors","sourcePdf":"00628823.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026973S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"4","articleId":"628823","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":628824,"authors":[{"name":"E.R.

Each pixel, 7.5/spl times/7.5 /spl mu/m/sup 2/, consists of three transistors and a photo diode, resulting in a 12-million transistor chip with a die size of 16.3/spl times/16.5 mm. The pixel has a nonintegrating direct readout architecture, with a logarithmic light-to-voltage conversion. This allows the array to be fully random accessible, both in space and time. The sensor has eight analog outputs, each with a pixel rate of 4.5 MHz, which implies a maximum frame rate of eight full frames per second. Sub-sampling or windowing makes higher frame rates possible. The yield of the sensor is high if one accepts a small number of bad pixels.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628827/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5712253","volume":"44","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Random addressable 2048/spl times/2048 active pixel image sensor","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random addressable 2048/spl times/2048 active pixel image sensor","sourcePdf":"00628827.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025078S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"65","articleId":"628827","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":628828,"authors":[{"name":"O.

By integrating a compression function onto the sensor focal plane, the image signal to be read out from the sensor is significantly reduced and the pixel rate of the sensor ran consequently be increased. The potential applications of the proposed sensor are in high pixel-rate imaging, such as high frame-rate image sensing and high-resolution image sensing. The compression scheme we employ is a conditional replenishment, which detects and encodes moving areas. In this paper, we introduce two architectures for on-sensor compression; one is the pixel parallel approach and the other is the column parallel approach. We prototyped a VLSI chip of the proposed sensor based on the pixel parallel architecture. We show the design and describe the results of the experiments obtained by the prototype chip.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628829/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5712255","volume":"44","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Computational image sensor for on sensor compression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computational image sensor for on sensor compression","sourcePdf":"00628829.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027925S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"38","articleId":"628829","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":628830,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The pixel distribution follows the log polar transform having more resolution in the center than in the periphery. For the fovea or central part, a different but also polar distribution has been adopted to fit the inner pixels. The particular problem of foveated image sensors is the signal scaling; pixels at different positions are different sizes and therefore different signal responses to the same illumination level. The difference among pixel responses is not only due to the differences among sensitive areas, but also to the differences among transistor channel sizes that, for submicron technologies, become a nonlinear problem. Some solutions for the signal scaling, small geometry effects (especially narrow-channel effects), and foveated structure, have been analyzed and successfully adopted for the presented sensor. The election of the CMOS process, instead of the CCD, is also discussed and analyzed.","doi":"10.1109/16.628830","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/13675/00628830.pdf","startPage":"1731","endPage":"1737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.628830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13675","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS foveated image sensor: signal scaling and small geometry effects","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628830/","displayDocTitle":"CMOS foveated image sensor: signal scaling and small geometry effects","volume":"44","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","accessionNumber":"5712256","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS foveated image sensor: signal scaling and small geometry effects","sourcePdf":"00628830.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044263S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"31","articleId":"628830","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":628832,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Despite its simple structure, this VSPD array realizes programmable focal plane image processing by employing between-pixel current mode calculations, together with a novel addressing method in which filtering is executed by varying the addressing pattern generated by a scanning unit. The n-MOS VSPD pixel which we have designed consists of a pn photodiode and an n-MOS differential amplifier; the VSPD circuit has been optimized by SPICE simulation. Using a 2-/spl mu/m n-MOS process gives a pixel size of 35 (H)/spl times/26 (V) /spl mu/m/sup 2/ with a photodiode fill factor of 25%. The artificial retina chip which has been fabricated incorporates 256/spl times/256 pixels, 16 parallel output ports, and a random access function. The photosensitivity is 0.8 /spl mu/A/lx for a 1-ms accumulation time. We demonstrate image capture in video mode and edge extraction mode, and light spot tracing using pattern matching in conjunction with the random access function.","doi":"10.1109/16.628836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13675","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.628836","endPage":"1782","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/13675/00628836.pdf","startPage":"1777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An artificial retina chip with current-mode focal plane image processing functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628836/","displayDocTitle":"An artificial retina chip with current-mode focal plane image processing functions","volume":"44","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"5712262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1997","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An artificial retina chip with current-mode focal plane image processing functions","sourcePdf":"00628836.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070065S","chronDate":"Oct 1997","isNumber":"13675","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"28","articleId":"628836","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":628842,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The ROM has a nominal access/cycle time performance of 2.3 ns/2.5 ns and is physically organized as 128 word lines by 1152 bit lines. Personalization is done at the gate level of the device. The technology used was the IBM CMOS6S technology which features Leff=0.2 /spl mu/m and a 2.5 V power supply. Several innovative circuit techniques were employed to achieve the aggressive ROM access/cycle time performance. Each stage in the access path is dynamically reset thereby avoiding the use of a centralized clock circuit and also yielding the benefit of a fast cycle time. The ROM macro features a dynamic reference source and sense amplifier which allows single ended sensing of a bit line. Also the sense amplifier clock is generate from the decoded word line through an OR tree. Hence the access time performance tracks with the loading on the decoded word line. The macro physical area is 3300/spl times/715 /spl mu/m/sup 2/ and the array cell has an area of 2/spl times/2 /spl mu/m/sup 2/. Less than 10% of the ROM macro area is designated to ABIST circuitry which allows for extensive test coverage.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1997.628876","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/4973/13677/00628876.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"255","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1997.628876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 400 MHz, 144 Kb CMOS ROM macro for an IBM S/390-class microprocessor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628876/","displayDocTitle":"A 400 MHz, 144 Kb CMOS ROM macro for an IBM S/390-class microprocessor","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5754028","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 400 MHz, 144 Kb CMOS ROM macro for an IBM S/390-class microprocessor","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00628876.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026297S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4973","citationCount":"7","articleId":"628876","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":628880,"authors":[{"name":"W.K.

Each locally synchronous module is surrounded by an \"asynchronous wrapper\" which provides an asynchronous interface to an otherwise synchronous circuit. Every locally synchronous (LS) region operates independently, minimising problems of clock skew and enabling regions to run at different clock speeds if desired. Metastability can never cause the system to fail because an asynchronous handshake \"stretches\" or \"pauses\" the local clock until data has stabilised. When new data is not available for processing, the local clock stretches, automatically preventing the LS block from consuming power. Once new data does arrive, the block responds directly in phase with the handshake without wasted synchronisation time. The LS modules can be designed using typical synchronous techniques. However, since the external interface to each LS block uses asynchronous handshaking, we can now freely mix synchronous and asynchronous circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1997.628884","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/4973/13677/00628884.pdf","startPage":"307","endPage":"314","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1997.628884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Asynchronous wrapper for heterogeneous systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628884","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628884/","displayDocTitle":"Asynchronous wrapper for heterogeneous systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5761640","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Asynchronous wrapper for heterogeneous systems","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00628884.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041825S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4973","citationCount":"60","articleId":"628884","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":628895,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The previous procedures that achieved high levels of compaction using this technique attempted to omit test vectors from a given test sequence one at a time or in consecutive subsequences. Consequently, the omission of each vector or subsequence required extensive simulation to determine the effects of each vector omission on the fault coverage. The proposed procedure first omits (almost) all the test vectors from the sequence, and then restores some of them as necessary to achieve the required fault coverage. The decision to restore a vector requires simulation of a single fault. Thus, the overall computational effort of this procedure is significantly lower. The loss of compaction compared to the scheme that omits the vectors one at a time or in subsequences is small in most cases. Experimental results are presented to support these claims.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1997.628895","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/4973/13677/00628895.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1997.628895","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13677","startPage":"360","endPage":"365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector restoration based static compaction of test sequences for synchronous sequential circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628895","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Vector restoration based static compaction of test sequences for synchronous sequential circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628895/","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5761641","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector restoration based static compaction of test sequences for synchronous sequential circuits","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00628895.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.019507S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4973","citationCount":"92","articleId":"628895","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":628897,"authors":[{"name":"R.D.

The input pattern (IP) fault model is a functional fault model that allows for both complete and partial functional verification of every circuit module, independent of the design level. We describe the IP fault model and provide a method for analyzing IP faults using standard SSL-based fault simulators and test generation tools. The method is used to generate test sets that target the IP faults of the ISCAS85 benchmark circuits and a carry-lookahead adder. Improved IP fault coverage for the benchmarks and the adder is obtained by adding a small number of test patterns to tests that target only SSL faults. We also conducted fault simulation experiments that show IP test patterns are effective in detecting non-targeted faults such as bridging and transistor stuck-on faults. Finally, we discuss the notion of IP redundancy and show how large amounts of this redundancy exist in the benchmarks and in SSL-irredundant adder circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1997.628897","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/4973/13677/00628897.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"380","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1997.628897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Properties of the input pattern fault model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=628897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628897/","displayDocTitle":"Properties of the input pattern fault model","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5761643","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Properties of the input pattern fault model","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00628897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030848S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4973","citationCount":"43","articleId":"628897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":628902,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

Our simulations show that a 4-issue machine with BP-based prefetching achieves higher performance than a plain cache 4 times the size.

Binary addition as carried out using a fast redundant-to-binary converter. It is shown that appropriate encoding of the redundant digits and recasting the binary addition as a redundant-to-binary conversion reduces the latency of addition from Wt/sub fa/, to Wt/sub mux/ where t/sub fa/ and t/sub mux/ respectively, represent binary full adder and multiplexer delays, and W is the word-length. A family of fast converter architectures is developed based on tree-type (obtained using lookahead techniques) and carry-select approaches. The carry-generation component is the critical component in redundant-to-binary conversion and binary addition. It is shown that fastest binary addition can be performed using (Wlog/sub 2/+W+1) multiplexers in time (log/sub 2/W+2)t/sub mux/. If the specified adder latency is greater than (log/sub 2/W+2)t/sub mux/, then a family of converters using fewest multiplexers can be designed based on carry-select approach. Finally a class of hybrid adders are designed by using a carry-select configuration and by substituting tree-based blocks in place of some carry-select blocks. It is shown that this approach can lead to adder designs which consume the least energy.","doi":"10.1109/ICCD.1997.628938","publicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings International Conference on Computer Design VLSI in Computers and Processors","pdfPath":"/iel3/4973/13677/00628938.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"684","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCD.1997.628938","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13677","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast low-energy VLSI binary addition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast low-energy VLSI binary addition","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"5761677","publicationDate":"1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/628938/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","conferenceDate":"12-15 Oct. 1997","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast low-energy VLSI binary addition","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00628938.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072004S","chronDate":"12-15 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4973","citationCount":"15","articleId":"628938","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":628954,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The main advantage of this nonlinear controller is that there is no restriction on the size of the signal variations around the operating point. Small as well as large signal variations around the operating point are considered. Sliding mode controllers for buck, boost, buck-boost, and Cuk power converters have been designed and discussed. These controllers have been simulated on a digital computer and their dynamic performances have been shown to be satisfactory. Finally, Lyapunov's second theorem has been used to verify the stability of the designed sliding mode controller for the Cuk power converter.","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '97.

The main problem in such an application is to guarantee the voltage balance across the devices both at steady-state and during switching transients, in order to avoid damaging overvoltages. In this paper, a novel approach is used to balance the voltage during switching transients by controlling the charge profile of the input gate capacitance. The main advantages of the proposed method consist in avoiding the common use of balancing capacitors in the output power side, and in working on the gate drive signals only. The application of the proposed gate drive technique is discussed first and then validated by experimental tests applied to the control of two series connected devices (MOSFETs or IGBTs). The proposed approach is also applicable for more than two devices. In particular, the validity has been proven by computer simulations for three components. Finally, a comparison is performed between the switching behaviors of two different configurations: a high-voltage application having for a high-voltage single switch device; or a series of two lower voltage rated devices. The advantage of the latter configuration, having the proposed active voltage balancing, over the former has been experimentally demonstrated with regard to the turn-off power losses.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1997.628978","publicationTitle":"IAS '97.

Its functions include, bus voltage stabilisation, conduction of ripple current due to switching events, etc. In automotive applications, one of the big issues is the extreme and harsh temperatures they have to withstand, underhood, which during the summer months would reduce their life. Most of the capacitors have maximum temperature ratings of either 85 or 105/spl deg/C and a few are rated at 125/spl deg/C. According to literature found, one of the primary wear-out mechanisms in electrolytic capacitors is mainly due to the loss of electrolyte by vapor diffusion through the seals. Other reports suggest that the main wearout mechanism is deterioration of the electrolyte. Experiments conducted to date and the results from the same are compared against modeling results based on a model reported in literature.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1997.628992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13652","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1065 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '97.

The intrinsic calculation delay of the dead-beat algorithm is shown to represent a serious hurdle for the achievement of a satisfactory compensation quality. In particular, meeting the IEC 1000-3-2 standards for class A equipment appears to be quite difficult especially in the high frequency range.

Many of the disturbances are caused by faults on the utility distribution system in one or more phases, resulting in voltage dips and sags. This paper presents a viable alternative to UPS solutions to three phase load support in the form of practical series compensator structures. The compensators consist of transformer coupled voltage source inverters fed from a single diode rectifier connected to the faulted AC supply. The balancing and regulating algorithms are developed and applied to partial and total single phase to three phase type of faults. The compensation capability of the proposed schemes are derived. Practical issues, such as design, converter rating and the relative merits of each topology are considered. The paper also provides experimental results for a 2 kVA prototype power conditioner.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1997.629037","publicationTitle":"IAS '97.

This control method requires neither the instantaneous value of the supply voltage nor any accurate circuit parameters on the AC side of the rectifier. Thus, a robust operation against the variation of the circuit parameters can be achieved. In the proposed control system, a digital resonant element implemented by a digital signal processor is introduced as a feedback controller. The digital resonant element exhibits a function similar to an integrator for the fundamental frequency components. Thus, it can eliminate the steady state control error of the input current completely. The principle of the proposed control method is discussed and its effectiveness is shown theoretically. The detailed method of the implementation of the loss-less digital resonant element is explained. The effects of the harmonics in the supply voltage on the AC input current waveform are clarified. To confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control method, some experimental results from two laboratory test systems are shown.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1997.629051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13652","startPage":"1496","endPage":"1503 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '97.

Dynamic and steady state overmodulation operating modes are clearly distinguished, and the requirements for obtaining high performance in each mode are shown to be significantly different. Dynamic overmodulation characteristics of the popular triangle intersection PWM methods are modeled and shown to be unique for each method. The study reveals that space vector PWM (SVPWM) exhibits a minimum voltage magnitude error characteristic. It also indicates all the advanced triangle intersection PWM methods including SVPWM have limited dynamic overmodulation performance. To enhance the performance, an algorithm with superior performance is adapted from the direct digital PWM approach. Detailed induction motor drive simulations illustrate the deficiency of popular triangle intersection PWM methods and the performance gained with the new dynamic overmodulation algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1997.629054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1997.629054","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13652","startPage":"1520","endPage":"1528 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"IAS '97.

The advantage of IGBTs is that device rise/fall time switching capability is 5-10 times faster, resulting in lower device switching losses and a more efficient and smaller drive package. However, faster output dv/dt transitions and higher drive carrier frequencies increase the magnitude of common mode (CM) electrical noise and electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems. Experience suggests all PWM drives with steep fronted output voltage waveforms have these problems. This paper provides a basic understanding of EMI generated by these drives solutions to control EMI, as well as regulation standards on allowable conducted and radiated emissions to insure a successful drive system installation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/629062/","accessionNumber":"5767107","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-9 Oct. 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generation, control and regulation of EMI from AC drives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation, control and regulation of EMI from AC drives","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00629062.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043945S","chronDate":"5-9 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13652","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4939","citationCount":"41","articleId":"629062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":629064,"authors":[{"name":"P.K.

Further technological breakthroughs within the hard driven GTO concept on device, gate-drive and application level are the base for the new \"integrated gate-commutated thyristor\" (IGCT). Homogenous switching due to hard drive technology enhances the safe-operating area of the IGCT up to the limits given by dynamic avalanche and therefore the physical limits of silicon. No dv/dt-snubbers are needed. Additionally the combination with improved loss characteristics allow the realization of new high frequency applications up in the kHz range. The gate-drive power requirements are reduced by factor of 5 compared to the standard GTO technology mainly resulting from the transparent anode design. A new IGCT device family with monolithically integrated high-power diodes has been developed for applications in the range of 0.5 MVA to 6 MVA. The inherent feasibility of series and parallel connection of the IGCT devices expands the power range up to several 100 MVA. A first 100 MVA intertie based on IGCT technology has already been in commercial operation for more than one year, showing the expected very high level of reliability of this new technology.","publicationTitle":"IAS '97.

The push-pull power converter topology is suitable for unregulated low-voltage to high-voltage power conversion, as in battery powered systems where input currents can exceed input voltages by an order of magnitude. The resonant circuit operates at twice the switching frequency, allowing for small resonant components. The MOSFET primary switches operate under zero voltage switching (ZVS) conditions due to commutation of the transformer magnetizing current and the snubbing effect of the drain-source capacitance. Output rectifier turn-off is effectively snubbed by the resonant capacitor. Laboratory tests show 93% efficiency at 12 V, 160 A input; 235 V, 1.8 kW output. A surge capability of 5 kW for 1 s has been demonstrated.

This innovative algorithm: (1) self-generates coarse estimates of the arrival angles to start off its MUSIC-based iterative search without any a priori information on the sources' parameters, (2) exploits the sources' polarization diversity, (3) decouples the estimation of the sources' arrival angles from the estimation of the sources' polarization parameters, and (4) automatically pairs the x-axis direction-cosine estimates with the y-axis direction-cosine estimates and with the polarization estimates. An electromagnetic vector-sensor is composed of six co-located diversely polarized antennas distinctly measuring all six electromagnetic-field components of a multi-source incident wave-field and is commercially available. This proposed algorithm forms polarized beams at each vector-sensor, based on coarse estimates of each source's respective electromagnetic-field components obtained by decoupling the signal-subspace eigenvectors. Simulation results verify this innovative scheme's capability to self-generate initial estimates for its MUSIC-based iterative search and demonstrate the proposed algorithm's superior performance relative to a similarly spaced array of unpolarized scalar sensors. Under one scenario, the proposed method lowers the estimation bias by 98% and the estimation standard deviation by 40%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IET","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Oct 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/629151/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"5759848","publicationDate":"1997","conferenceDate":"14-16 Oct. 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Polarization-beamspace self-initiating MUSIC for azimuth/elevation angle estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polarization-beamspace self-initiating MUSIC for azimuth/elevation angle estimation","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"00629151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046044S","chronDate":"14-16 Oct 1997","isNumber":"13678","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4974","citationCount":"7","articleId":"629151","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":629200,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A simple solution to this problem is to add fill pulses to each coherent dwell, so that every PRF interval processed by the FIR filter will include clutter from all range ambiguous intervals. For radars needing to operate with a short time-on-target, this approach degrades the performance due to wasted transmitter power and a longer dwell time. The use of amplitude weighting of the transmitted pulse burst to overcome this problem is well known from studies relating to ballistic missile defense radars operating in an environment of range extended debris and chaff. In conventional ground based radar scenarios, clutter is usually present in the same range interval as the target but may also come from longer ambiguous ranges. The maximum range of clutter is usually limited by the radar horizon, but may extend beyond the radar horizon due to non-standard propagation. For such scenarios an amplitude weighting scheme has been proposed where only the leading pulses in the coherent dwell are weighted in amplitude. This paper presents a trade-off between this unilateral weighting approach and the bilateral weighting schemes considered previously.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clutter suppression","amplitude weighted waveforms","PRF interval","constant amplitude radar pulse-burst","coherent dwell","Doppler filtering","FIR filter bank","range ambiguous intervals","short time-on-target","transmitter power","transmitted pulse burst","ballistic missile defense radar","range extended debris","chaff","ground based radar","radar horizon","nonstandard propagation","unilateral weighting","bilateral weighting"]}],"doi":"10.1049/cp:19971786","publicationTitle":"Radar 97 (Conf.

However, the best-effort nature of multicast delivery results in poor playback quality in the presence of network congestion and packet loss. Contrary to widespread belief that the real-time nature of continuous media applications precludes the possibility of recovery of lost packets using retransmissions, we have found that these applications offer an interesting tradeoff between the desired playback quality and the desired degree of interactivity. In particular, we propose a new model of multicast delivery called resilient multicast in which each receiver in a multicast group can decide its own tradeoff between reliability and real-time requirements. To be effective, error recovery mechanisms in such a model need to be both fast (due to the real-time constraint) and have a low overhead (due to high volume of continuous media data). We have designed a resilient multicast protocol called STORM (STructure-Oriented Resilient Multicast) in which senders and receivers collaborate to recover from lost packets using two key ideas. First, group participants self-organize themselves into a distribution structure and use the structure to recover lost packets from adjacent nodes. Second, the distribution structure is dynamic and a lightweight algorithm is used to adapt the structure to changing network traffic conditions and group membership. We have implemented STORM in both VAT and a packet level simulator. Experimental results using both the MBONE and a simulation model demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.","doi":"10.1109/NOSDAV.1997.629385","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Workshop on Network and Operating System Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV '97)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Workshop on Network and Operating System Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4971/13667/00629385.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"194","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOSDAV.1997.629385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resilient multicast support for continuous-media applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=629385","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/629385/","displayDocTitle":"Resilient multicast support for continuous-media applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5760175","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resilient multicast support for continuous-media applications","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00629385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094129S","chronDate":"19-21 May 1997","isNumber":"13667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4971","citationCount":"42","articleId":"629385","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":629390,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In contrast to stored video, live applications typically have limited knowledge of frame sizes and often require bounds on the delay between the source and the client(s). This paper addresses bandwidth smoothing for a growing number of live video applications, such as videocasts of courses or television news, where many clients be willing to tolerate a playback delay of several seconds or minutes in exchange for a smaller throughput requirement. Extending techniques for smoothing pre-recorded video, we develop online, window-based smoothing algorithms for these delay-tolerant applications. Experiments with MPEG traces demonstrate that the new algorithms significantly reduce the peak rate, coefficient of variation, and effective bandwidth of variable-bit-rate video streams using fairly small window sizes (1-10 seconds), closely approximating the performance of the optimal offline algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/NOSDAV.1997.629390","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Workshop on Network and Operating System Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV '97)","pdfPath":"/iel3/4971/13667/00629390.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13667","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NOSDAV.1997.629390","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 7th International Workshop on Network and Operating System Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV '97)","startPage":"235","endPage":"243","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online smoothing of live, variable-bit-rate video","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=629390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 May 1997","displayDocTitle":"Online smoothing of live, variable-bit-rate video","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/629390/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1997","accessionNumber":"5766193","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-21 May 1997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online smoothing of live, variable-bit-rate video","confLoc":"St. Louis, MO, USA","sourcePdf":"00629390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04951S","chronDate":"19-21 May 1997","isNumber":"13667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4971","citationCount":"35","articleId":"629390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":629420,"authors":[{"name":"J.F.

This paper presents a general procedure for main flux saturation modelling in smooth air-gap synchronous machines, that is applicable for most selections of state-space variables. The method relies on the concept of 'generalised flux' and 'generalised inductance', that has been successfully applied in modelling of saturated single-cage and double-cage induction machines. The concept is extended to saturation modelling in smooth air-gap synchronous machines. A number of models, that result from the application of the method for different selections of state-space variables, are presented in detail.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1997","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/629697/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1997","volume":"12","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"5606802","publicationDate":"June 1997","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Modelling of magnetic saturation in smooth air-gap synchronous machines","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling of magnetic saturation in smooth air-gap synchronous machines","sourcePdf":"00629697.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026882S","chronDate":"Jun 1997","isNumber":"13681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"17","articleId":"629697","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":629699,"authors":[{"name":"Lim Choo Min","affiliation":["Electronic & Computer Engineering Department, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore"],"lastName":"Lim Choo Min","id":"37087513055"},{"name":"Li Qing","affiliation":["Electronic & Computer Engineering Department, Ngee Ann Polytechnic, Singapore"],"lastName":"Li Qing","id":"37087514010"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8969"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0059"}],"articleNumber":"629699","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":79},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/power/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=629699","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive systems","Neural networks","Power systems","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system control","neurocontrollers","adaptive control","control system synthesis","learning (artificial intelligence)","control system analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multimachine power system","enhanced adaptive neural network control scheme","adaptive linear element","disturbances","control design","operating conditions","control performance","control simulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/60.629699","pdfPath":"/iel4/60/13681/00629699.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","startPage":"166","endPage":"174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13681","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.629699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An enhanced adaptive neural network control scheme for power systems","abstract":"An enhanced adaptive neural network control scheme, based on the adaptive linear element (Adaline), is proposed and tested by applying it to a multimachine power system.

The output power from a PV module depends on environmental factors such as irradiation and cell temperature. For the operation planning of power systems, the prediction of the power generation is inevitable for PV systems. For this purpose, irradiation, temperature and wind velocity are utilized as the input information to the proposed neural network. The output is the predicted maximum power generation under the condition given by those environmental factors. The efficiency of the proposed estimation scheme is evaluated by using actual data on daily, monthly and yearly bases. The proposed method gives highly accurate predictions compared with predictions using the conventional multiple regression model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based estimation of maximum power generation from PV module using environmental information","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","doi":"10.1109/60.629709","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion","pdfPath":"/iel4/60/13687/00629709.pdf","startPage":"241","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/60.629709","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=13687","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=629709","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/629709/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1997","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1997","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based estimation of maximum power generation from PV module using environmental information","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1997","accessionNumber":"5688208","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based estimation of maximum power generation from PV module using environmental information","sourcePdf":"00629709.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052646S","chronDate":"Sep 1997","isNumber":"13687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"60","citationCount":"240","articleId":"629709","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1997","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":629735,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Widely used image and video compression standards, such as JPEG and MPEG, use the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (DCT) to achieve near-optimal compression of individual frames. This is done by decomposing the the frames into components of different spatial frequencies. This paper presents an extension of the DCT to the temporal dimension. It describes the implementation of a software based compression scheme which involves the computation of a three dimensional DCT of successive groups of eight frames. This compression scheme transforms the eight image frames into eight DCT frames with components of both spatial and temporal frequencies. The compression scheme was implemented and tested with standard MPEG video test sequences. It showed compression performance comparable to various MPEG implementations.","doi":"10.1109/COMSIG.1997.629976","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1997 South African Symposium on Communications and Signal Processing.
