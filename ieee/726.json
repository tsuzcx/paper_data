Most of the existing methods determine the optimal path based on a discrete representation of the environmental data, which may produce metrication errors. In order to remedy this problem, we present a novel 3D path plan method, based on the framework of fast marching, to determine the optimal path for UAVs. The proposed algorithm is inspired by the phenomenon of front propagation, which is consistent with continuous front propagation rules. It allows for producing continuous and smoothed trajectory without further processing, thus improving the overall quality of the planned path. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach are demonstrated by comparative simulations. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms commonly used A* based and population optimization based planners in terms of the efficiency and accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260005","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260005.pdf","startPage":"2379","endPage":"2383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260005","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Three dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle path planning by a continuous optimization method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260005","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260005/","displayDocTitle":"Three dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle path planning by a continuous optimization method","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15453406","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7260005/","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Three dimensional unmanned aerial vehicle path planning by a continuous optimization method","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0426.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05179S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260005","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7260007,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Guang-chi","affiliation":["College of Mechanics Engineering, Heilongjiang Agricultural Engineering Vocational College, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Guang-chi","id":"37085614083"},{"name":"Zhao Da-wei","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Da-wei","id":"38277329900"},{"name":"Zhang Kai-wei","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Kai-wei","id":"37085629910"},{"name":"Ge Jing-hua","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Ge","lastName":"Jing-hua","id":"37085633421"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7260007","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Optimization","Sociology","Statistics","Heuristic algorithms","Azimuth","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["marine systems","multi-agent systems","nonlinear control systems","particle swarm optimisation","position control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic positioning vessels","multi-agent chaos particle swarm optimization algorithm","thrust allocation","nonlinear optimization problems","multi-agent topological structure","particle swarm global search ability","chaotic local search"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic positioning","optimization algorithm","thrust allocation","Multi-Agent","CPSO"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260007","abstract":"As an important component of the vessel's Dynamic Positioning (DP) System, thrust allocation determines the control input of each thruster device from the control law.

By this approach, a state observer-based adaptive neural networks output-feedback control scheme is presented for a class of nonlinear non-strict-feedback systems. It is shown that the proposed controller can guarantee semi-global boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop systems and the output of the system converges to a small neighborhood of zero with appropriate design parameters. Simulation result is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260126","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260126.pdf","startPage":"3152","endPage":"3157","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260126","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive neural network control for a class of non-strict-feedback nonlinear systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260126/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive neural network control for a class of non-strict-feedback nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15440319","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7260126/","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive neural network control for a class of non-strict-feedback nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.122937S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260126","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7260132,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Han","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, P.

Firstly, a novel method, based on the orthogonal least squares (OLS), is put forward to add input and hidden units to the existing network one by one. Every unit added to the network affords the maximal reduction of the sum of squared errors (SSE). Then, the FGCNN incrementally updates its output weights by iterations without gradients and generalized inverses, while the other weights remain unchanged during the growth of the network. The simple and effective training method make the FGCNN learn extremely fast. Finally, the proposed FGCNN is applied to estimate the BOD in WWTPs using other easy-to-measure or secondary variables. The experiment results show that the FGCNN has better performance on real-time estimation of BOD than other similar methods.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260167","startPage":"3417","endPage":"3422","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260167.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A fast growing cascade neural network for BOD estimation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Estimation","Wastewater treatment","Artificial neural networks","Training","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cascade systems","iterative methods","mean square error methods","neurocontrollers","wastewater treatment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast growing cascade neural network","BOD estimation","FGCNN","software sensor","biochemical oxygen demand","BOD","wastewater treatment plants","WWTP","orthogonal least squares","OLS","sum of squared errors","SSE","iterations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural network","biochemical oxygen demand","wastewater treatment plant","software sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260167/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A fast growing cascade neural network for BOD estimation","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7260167/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15453473","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A fast growing cascade neural network for BOD estimation","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0608.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074425S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260167","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7260171,"authors":[{"name":"Shen Yi","affiliation":["School of Automation, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, CN"],"lastName":"Shen Yi","id":"37087292964"},{"name":"Jia ZhenZhen","affiliation":["Research Institute of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, Shenzhen, P.

Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the derived theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260176","startPage":"3478","endPage":"3483","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260176.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization for discrete-time memristive recurrent neural networks with time-delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260176/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Synchronization for discrete-time memristive recurrent neural networks with time-delays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7260176/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15453935","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization for discrete-time memristive recurrent neural networks with time-delays","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0619.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067551S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7260178,"authors":[{"name":"Yongbin Yu","affiliation":["School of Information and Software Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, Sichuan, P.

sliding mode controller design for static var compensator","abstract":"To enhance the transient stability of the electric power control system, a radial basis function (RBF) neural networks sliding mode controller design is proposed for static var compensator (SVC) with uncertain parameter. Unlike the conventional adaptive control schemes, the certainty equivalence principle is not required for estimating the uncertain parameter in adaptive law design. Based on the system immersion and manifold invariant (I&I) adaptive control, the designed adaptive law ensure that the estimation error can converge to zero in finite time. In addition, the control law is designed by the (radial basis function) RBF sliding mode control. The neural networks can compensate for the nonlinear uncertain effect in SVC system by its universal approximation ability. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is verified by the simulations. Compared with adaptive backstepping sliding mode and adaptive backstepping, the oscillation amplitudes of system state variables are reduced by at least 17%, and the response approaches steady state is shortened by 7%.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260179/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15453429","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7260179/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"RBF neural networks sliding mode controller design for static var compensator","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RBF neural networks sliding mode controller design for static var compensator","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0624.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061307S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7260181,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Pu-Chong","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Software Engineering, Tianjin Polytechnic University, Tianjin, P.

The LBP vectors compose the searching space of particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm which is designed for find the optimal spectrogram. The fitness function of PSO algorithm is designed by between-class distances and within-class distances.

Since the tracking process can be formed as a dynamic optimization problem. PSO, an effective algorithm to solve optimization problem, has been used in tracking widely. However, it has been proved that the traditional PSO is easy to converge to local optimum. In this paper, we adopt quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) for visual tracking. QPSO has better global convergence compared with the PSO, and can overcome the shortcomings of PSO algorithm. In order to achieve better tracking performance, we improve the traditional tracking framework based on PSO and propose a sequential QPSO based tracking algorithm in this paper. We conduct numerous experiments, and the results have shown the effectiveness of our method, even when the object undergoes abrupt motion or large changes in illumination, scale and appearance.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260232","startPage":"3844","endPage":"3851","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260232.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Visual tracking using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260232/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Visual tracking using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7260232/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15440374","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Visual tracking using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072322S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7260248,"authors":[{"name":"Wen Jun","affiliation":["School of Automation Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Jun","id":"37085724997"},{"name":"Zhong Chaolliang","affiliation":["School of Automation Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Zhong","lastName":"Chaolliang","id":"37085738793"},{"name":"Liu Shirong","affiliation":["School of Automation Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Shirong","id":"37541233800"},{"name":"Wang Jian","affiliation":["School of Automation Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Jian","id":"37085650389"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7260248","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image segmentation","Neural networks","Labeling","Accuracy","Training","Training data","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image representation","image segmentation","neural nets","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outdoor scene labeling","deep convolutional neural networks","region-level scene labeling approach","mean shift segmentation algorithm","probability scores","image representation","campus environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional neural network","Mean Shift segmentation","Scene labeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260248","abstract":"In this paper, a new region-level scene labeling approach is proposed, which combines a deep convolutional neural network with the Mean Shift segmentation algorithm.

(BCI) based on motor imagery EEG, this paper presents a feature extraction method combining Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) and sample entropy. Firstly, the motor imagery EEG signals are decomposed by DTCWT. Then, the rhythm waves corresponding to the event-related desynchronization (ERD)/event-related synchronization (ERS) phenomenon are extracted and reconstructed. Finally, the features are extracted from the rhythm signal using sample entropy. The Datasets1 of BCI Competition IV, including motor imagery EEG data of left hand, right hand and foot, is used to verify the proposed method.

The inputs of each neural network observer are the estimated currents and the current estimation errors corresponding, while the output of each neural network observer is the back electromotive force (EMF). So the estimations of the back EMF are obtained from neural network observer, from which the estimations of the rotor position and speed are calculated, respectively.

As regards to the innovation of the IHIWO algorithm, the distribution variance is improved instead of the exponential function used in the original invasive weed optimization (IWO). Invoking the adopted method, the relationship between the global convergence and the local convergence can be effectively balanced. Simulations are performed based on rastrigin and grienwank functions to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method as compared with IWO, Modified Adaptive Dispersion Invasive Weed Optimization (MADIWO) and IHIWO. The viability of the employed algorithm is also illustrated with numerical simulations in the application of antenna array beamformer. Simulation results show that the IHIWO algorithm can not only guarantee the higher convergence accuracy, but also improve the convergence rate, when compared with the IWO and ADIWO methods. Furthermore, the presented algorithm also holds the strong ability against the interferences, and it does not incline to falling into the local optimal solution.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260384","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","startPage":"4813","endPage":"4817","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260384.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved hybrid invasive weed optimization for antenna beamformer","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260384/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7260384/","displayDocTitle":"An improved hybrid invasive weed optimization for antenna beamformer","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15453767","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved hybrid invasive weed optimization for antenna beamformer","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"0857.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108054S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260384","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7260392,"authors":[{"name":"Xie Xiao-zhu","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Academy of Armored Force Engineering, Beijing"],"firstName":"Xie","lastName":"Xiao-zhu","id":"37085459994"},{"name":"Xu Ya-wei","affiliation":["Department of Information, Beijing"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Ya-wei","id":"38469467600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7260392","dbTime":"26 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","statistical analysis","trees (mathematics)","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisensor image fusion scheme","dual-tree complex wavelet transform","DT-CWT","decomposition method","window-based fusion rule","local variance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image Fusion","DT-CWT","Local Variance"]}],"abstract":"The development of decomposition methods improves the quality of image fusion.

New model called structure regularized traffic monitoring (SRTM) is presented by incorporating the spatial and temporal properties of the traffic matrices, with the sparsity of the traffic volume anomalies. The proposed SRTM model adapts more naturally to the engineering nature of the real traffic data and imposes structural regularizations. This stems from the fact that the real traffic data is usually approximately instead of exactly low-rank and exhibits strong spatial and temporal dependencies. In addition, we take advantages of the sparsity of the traffic volume anomalies and impose sparse constraints on the variables to detect the traffic anomalies.

It can reduce the accumulating drift of localization algorithms if the loops are checked correctly. Traditional loop closure detection approaches take advantage of Bag-of-Words model, which clusters the feature descriptors as words and measures the similarity between the observations in the word space. However, the features are usually designed artificially and may not be suitable for data from new-coming sensors. In this paper a novel loop closure detection approach is proposed that learns features from raw data using deep neural networks instead of common visual features. We discuss the details of the method of training neural networks. Experiments on an open dataset are also demonstrated to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. It can be seen that the neural network is feasible to solve this problem.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260555","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260555.pdf","startPage":"5851","endPage":"5856","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loop closure detection for visual SLAM systems using deep neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260555/","displayDocTitle":"Loop closure detection for visual SLAM systems using deep neural networks","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7260555/","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15440203","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loop closure detection for visual SLAM systems using deep neural networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1044.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.103679S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7260563,"authors":[{"name":"Ting Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, dmonton, Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Ting","lastName":"Yang","id":"37072225600"},{"name":"Yi Li Fu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Robotics and Systems, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China"],"firstName":"Yi Li","lastName":"Fu","id":"37286601800"},{"name":"Mahdi Tavakoi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, dmonton, Alberta, Canada"],"firstName":"Mahdi","lastName":"Tavakoi","id":"37085617429"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7260563","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Control systems","Teleoperators","Force","Iron","Gain","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous time systems","discrete time systems","force control","matrix algebra","position control","stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sampling effect","bilateral teleoperation system transparency","stability conditions","hybrid matrix parameters","force tracking performance","position tracking performance","continuous-time control","discrete-time control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bilateral teleoperation","hybrid parameters","discrete-time control","continuous-time control","system performance"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260563","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260563","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260563","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260563.pdf","startPage":"5896","endPage":"5900","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of sampling effect on bilateral teleoperation system transparency","abstract":"The performances of continuous-time controlled and discrete-time controlled bilateral teleoperation systems are mathematically and experimentally studied and compared.

The basic idea behind this study is the application of a one-to-one mapping between a parity vector and the solution of Luenberger equations, the identification of the parity space and the Hammerstein nonlinearity via the over-parameterization and least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). For the realization of adaptivity, the linear and nonlinear parameters are separated and estimated recursively in a parallel manner, with each updating algorithm using the most up-to-date estimation produced by the other algorithm at each time instant. Hence the procedure is termed the alternately adaptive algorithm. Furthermore, the stability condition of algorithm is investigated.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260619","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260619","startPage":"6242","endPage":"6247","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260619.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data-driven design and implementation of an alternately adaptive residual generator for Hammerstein systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Data-driven design and implementation of an alternately adaptive residual generator for Hammerstein systems","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7260619/","accessionNumber":"15440405","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260619/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Data-driven design and implementation of an alternately adaptive residual generator for Hammerstein systems","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.135533S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260619","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7260634,"authors":[{"name":"Siqin Tao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Siqin","lastName":"Tao","id":"37085763434"},{"name":"Tao Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37288851000"},{"name":"Jun Yang","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Yang","id":"37696189100"},{"name":"Xueqian Wang","affiliation":["Center of Intelligent Control and Telescience, Tsinghua University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Xueqian","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085383477"},{"name":"Weining Lu","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Weining","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085495844"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7260634","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1185},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Noise","Training","Accuracy","Fault diagnosis","Cost function","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","generalisation (artificial intelligence)","machine bearings","mechanical engineering computing","neural nets","pattern classification","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bearing fault diagnosis method","stacked autoencoder","softmax regression","mechanical structure","deep-neural network algorithm framework","classification performance","structure parameter networks","generalization capability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault Diagnosis","Stacked Autoencoder","Softmax Regression","Classification","Robustness"]}],"abstract":"As bearings are the most common components of mechanical structure, it will be helpful to research bearing fault and diagnose the fault as early as possible in case of suffering greater losses.

As the changing environment, we consider the uncertainty of measurable interference. So a robust stackelberg game is presented to formulate the two-tier uplink power allocation problem. Noncooperation game is applied to realize the maximum worst-case utility for each femtocell device. And also probability constraint manner is achieved to guarantee the performance for macrocell device. The proof about the uniqueness of equilibrium is given.

This method has been verified in simulations where multiple quad-rotors cooperatively complete a challenging simultaneous arrival mission.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260740","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260740.pdf","startPage":"6961","endPage":"6968","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260740","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bio-inspired collision-free 4D trajectory generation method for unmanned aerial vehicles based on tau theory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A bio-inspired collision-free 4D trajectory generation method for unmanned aerial vehicles based on tau theory","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7260740/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15453581","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260740/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bio-inspired collision-free 4D trajectory generation method for unmanned aerial vehicles based on tau theory","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1242.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080763S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7260759,"authors":[{"name":"Na Huang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanics and Engineering Science, College of Engineering, Peking University, Beijing, P.

We are aiming at finding the minimum power of femtocell users to save the energy and suppress the interference. Since the channel gains are changeable with environment, tracking the instantaneous channel gains may be difficult in practice. Here we consider the mean channel gains are available. In order to solve the problem with uncertainty, a robust optimization problem is researched. Considering the Signal-of-Interference-Plus-Noise ratio of macrocell user and femtocell users as probabilistic constraint conditions, we turn the uncertain factors into the deterministic factors. Since the deterministic form of the outage probability constraint is not convex of power, then a novel but simple method is utilized to solve the power allocation. An admission algorithm is proposed to remove the femtocell users which do not satisfy the requirement. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of robust power control algorithm and the admission control algorithm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust power control with probability constraint for co-channel two-tier femtocell networks","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260867","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260867.pdf","startPage":"7730","endPage":"7735","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260867","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260867/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Robust power control with probability constraint for co-channel two-tier femtocell networks","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7260867/","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15453890","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust power control with probability constraint for co-channel two-tier femtocell networks","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1374.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07711S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260867","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7260875,"authors":[{"name":"Zhou Yan","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Yan","id":"38466521200"},{"name":"Zhou Cong","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, China"],"firstName":"Zhou","lastName":"Cong","id":"37085642112"},{"name":"Dongli Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Hunan, CN"],"firstName":"Dongli","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405342700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7260875","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision support systems","Ultra wideband technology","Transceivers","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","radio links","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low rate sampling techniques","UWB systems","ultrawideband wireless communication","UWB wireless communication","wireless links","analog to digital conversion","ADC","Nyquist ADC","compressed sensing","CS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultra-wideband","sampling rate","ADC","compressed sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260875","abstract":"Ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communication is a promising technique for conveying high rate data over short length wireless links. But it requires extremely high sampling rate analog to digital conversion (ADC). State-of-the-art Nyquist ADCs can achieve a sampling rate of 550 MHz at 12 bits resolution, or 3 GHz with 8 bits resolution. Therefore, the ADC sampling rate and resolution become of utmost importance for UWB system applications. In this paper, recent advances in theory and techniques for low-rate sampling in UWB systems are reviewed. From canonical parallel approaches to recently developed compressed sensing (CS) based approaches are systematically discussed.

The unique feature of the kite-based system is its structural simplicity coupled with the complexity in its modeling and control. Since the system is open-loop unstable, it is difficult to model and it subjects to significant external disturbances during operation. To address these challenges, nonlinear predictive functional controller (PFC) is presented in this paper. Firstly, a predictive model is established for the power kite using hybrid neural network, and then the PFC principles are applied for its controller design. With the neural network structure, the PFC integrates on-line identification, learning mechanism and predictive controller. A closed-loop control system is developed and implemented to improve the performance of the power kite. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been illustrated by numerical simulation tests.","doi":"10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260889","startPage":"7866","endPage":"7870","publicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ChiCC.2015.7260889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7259602","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 34th Chinese Control Conference (CCC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7225914/7259602/07260889.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive functional control of power kites for high altitude wind energy generation based on hybrid neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7260889/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Predictive functional control of power kites for high altitude wind energy generation based on hybrid neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7260889/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15440442","publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","conferenceDate":"28-30 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive functional control of power kites for high altitude wind energy generation based on hybrid neural network","confLoc":"Hangzhou, China","sourcePdf":"1398.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056398S","chronDate":"28-30 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7225914","isNumber":"7259602","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7225914","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7259602","articleId":"7260889","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7260929,"authors":[{"name":"Qi Yunlong","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Vehicular Transmission, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Yunlong","id":"37085457945"},{"name":"Wang Weida","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Vehicular Transmission, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Weida","id":"37680647100"},{"name":"Xiang Changle","affiliation":["National Key Lab of Vehicular Transmission, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Changle","id":"38099616200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-9-8815-6389-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1934-1768"}],"articleNumber":"7260929","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":164},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7260929","abstract":"Now hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) control strategies are mainly aiming at the optimal fuel economy. The performance of most control strategies depends on the driving cycle pre-known. Changing driving condition will influence the optimal results greatly. Therefore, a neural network controller (NNC) is proposed for a dual-mode hybrid vehicle, which can improve fuel efficiency and maintain battery's state of charge (SOC) in most driving conditions. The NNC combined with an efficiency-based strategy can further reducing vehicle fuel consumption by improving the transmission efficiency. The proposed NNC is testified through the hardware-in-the-loop simulation. The test results show that, the control strategy combined neural network and efficiency-based strategy can reduce vehicle fuel consumption and control the battery SOC in a reasonable range.

This paper will discuss the design considerations in the construction of an experimental ultrahigh-definition video system with 4000 scanning lines. The scanning parameters were determined based on the relationship between the sensation of reality and the viewing angle. The camera system was developed based on the four-CCD (charge-coupled device) image-acquisition technology: two 2.5-in. 8M-pixel CCDs are used for green, and one each for red and blue. The four-CCD beam-splitting system incorporates two-dimensional pixel offset to form a Bayer color-sampling pattern with the CCDs. A 4000-scanning-line display system was also developed. It is similar to the imaging system, which uses four 8M-pixel LCDs to realize a 4000-scanning-line system, one each for red and blue, and two for green with diagonal pixel offset. The viewing angle is more than 100\u00b0 horizontally, at a standard viewing position of 3 m from a 320-in.

The vector quantizer codebook is designed on-line by backward adaptation based on previous reconstructed frames. It thus takes advantage of the information already available at the receiver for adapting the codebook without recourse to side information. The method adapts the codebook to local motion statistics and thus exploits interframe motion correlations. It also eliminates the need for extensive prior codebook training, as well as problems of statistical mismatch due to scene variation. Preliminary experiments on benchmark video sequences show average improvement of about 0.8dB in SNR, and improved perceptual quality of the reconstructed video. The enhanced performance is achieved at the cost of only a fractional increase in complexity as compared to standard motion compensation methods.","doi":"10.5594/M001238","publicationTitle":"International Workshop on HDTV '96","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on HDTV '96","pdfPath":"/iel7/7263280/7263281/07263291.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/M001238","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263281","startPage":"79","endPage":"84","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motion Compensation by Adaptive Vector Quantization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7263291","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","displayDocTitle":"Motion Compensation by Adaptive Vector Quantization","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Oct. 1996","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7263291/","conferenceDate":"8-9 Oct. 1996","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motion Compensation by Adaptive Vector Quantization","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10-5594_M001238.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102114S","chronDate":"8-9 Oct. 1996","isNumber":"7263281","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7263280","articleId":"7263291","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"SMPTE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7263294,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Ancona","affiliation":["Dept. of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genoa, Via all'Opera Pia 11a, 16145 Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabio","lastName":"Ancona"},{"name":"Stefano Rovetta","affiliation":["Dept. of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genoa, Via all'Opera Pia 11a, 16145 Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Rovetta"},{"name":"Rodolfo Zunino","affiliation":["Dept. of Biophysical and Electronic Engineering (DIBE), University of Genoa, Via all'Opera Pia 11a, 16145 Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Zunino"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61482-947-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7263294","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":0},"abstract":"The paper describes a board-based hardware implementation of a neural algorithm performing vector quantization for very low bit-rate video compression.

The cyclic convolution property of the DFT enables a low complexity equalization scheme at the expense of bandwidth efficiency since a \u201cguard time\u201d is required. Moreover this technique is very specific to DFT-based OFDM systems. As digital modulations generate continuous signals after baseband level digital filtering, non-critical sampling is recommended, that is, some zero symbols must be appended to the block of symbols to be modulated. As shown in [10], minimizing a quadratic criterion based on the subband components of the received signal that should be null is sufficient to perform (blind) equalization. Therefore less channel capacity is lost since neither a guard time nor reference symbols are required. The performance of a linear equalizer using this criterion is studied here for COFDM systems with 64-QAM subcarrier modulation.","displayPublicationTitle":"International Workshop on HDTV '96","pdfPath":"/iel7/7263280/7263281/07263316.pdf","startPage":"311","endPage":"319","publicationTitle":"International Workshop on HDTV '96","doi":"10.5594/M001263","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/M001263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7263316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Equalization of COFDM Systems Based on the Minimization of a Quadratic Criterion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7263316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-9 Oct. 1996","displayDocTitle":"Blind Equalization of COFDM Systems Based on the Minimization of a Quadratic Criterion","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1996","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","conferenceDate":"8-9 Oct. 1996","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Equalization of COFDM Systems Based on the Minimization of a Quadratic Criterion","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10-5594_M001263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037017S","chronDate":"8-9 Oct. 1996","isNumber":"7263281","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7263280","articleId":"7263316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1996","subType":"SMPTE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7263344,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Jin","affiliation":["Hanyang University"],"bio":{"p":["Yong Jin received his B.S. degree from Yanbian University, Yanji, China, in 2008, and his M.S. degree from Kwandong University, Gangneung, Korea, in 2011.

Then we focus on the physical-layer security of CR networks against eavesdropping and examine the secrecy performance of cognitive communications in terms of secrecy outage probability. We further consider the use of relays for improving CR security against eavesdropping and propose an opportunistic relaying scheme, where a relay node that makes CR communications most resistant to eavesdropping is chosen to participate in assisting the transmission from a cognitive source to its destination. It is illustrated that the physical- layer secrecy of CR communications relying on opportunistic relaying can be significantly improved by increasing the number of relays, showing the security benefit of exploiting relay nodes.

Full duplex radios are capable of opening new possibilities in contexts of high traffic demand where there are limited radio resources. A critical issue, however, in implementing full duplex radios in real wireless environments is being able to cancel self-interference. To overcome the selfinterference challenge, we prototype our design on a software-defined radio platform. This design combines a dual-polarization antenna-based analog part with a digital self-interference canceler that operates in real time. Prototype test results confirm that the proposed full duplex system achieves about 1.9 times higher throughput than a half duplex system.

In this article, a promising technology, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), is discussed, which can address some of these challenges for 5G. Different from conventional orthogonal multiple access technologies, NOMA can accommodate much more users via nonorthogonal resource allocation. We divide existing dominant NOMA schemes into two categories: power-domain multiplexing and code-domain multiplexing, and the corresponding schemes include power-domain NOMA, multiple access with low-density spreading, sparse code multiple access, multi-user shared access, pattern division multiple access, and so on. We discuss their principles, key features, and pros/cons, and then provide a comprehensive comparison of these solutions from the perspective of spectral efficiency, system performance, receiver complexity, and so on. In addition, challenges, opportunities, and future research trends for NOMA design are highlighted to provide some insight on the potential future work for researchers in this field. Finally, to leverage different multiple access schemes including both conventional OMA and new NOMA, we propose the concept of software defined multiple access (SoDeMA), which enables adaptive configuration of available multiple access schemes to support diverse services and applications in future 5G networks.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263349","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263349","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7263333/07263349.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-orthogonal multiple access for 5G: solutions, challenges, opportunities, and future research trends","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Non-orthogonal multiple access for 5G: solutions, challenges, opportunities, and future research trends","volume":"53","issue":"9","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2015","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7263349/","publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15456677","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7263349/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-orthogonal multiple access for 5G: solutions, challenges, opportunities, and future research trends","sourcePdf":"016DAI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045145S","chronDate":"September  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7263333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"1598","xplore-issue":"7263333","articleId":"7263349","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7263350,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-lin I","affiliation":["China Mobile Research Institute, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"bio":{"p":["Chih-Lin I is the China Mobile chief scientist of wireless technologies, in charge of advanced wireless communication R&D effort of China Mobile Research Institute (CMRI).

NGFI aims to better support key 5G technologies, in particular cloud RAN, network functions virtualization, and large-scale antenna systems. NGFI claims the advantages of reduced bandwidth as well as improved transmission efficiency by exploiting the tidal wave effect on mobile network traffic. The transmission of NGFI is based on Ethernet to enjoy the benefits of flexibility and reliability. The major impact, challenges, and potential solutions of Ethernet-based fronthaul networks are also analyzed.

In addition, our architecture reduces time to market for employing newly emerging services without mandating any changes in 4G infrastructures.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263333","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263353","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7263333/07263353.pdf","startPage":"108","endPage":"114","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software defined service migration through legacy service integration into 4G networks and future evolutions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2015","displayDocTitle":"Software defined service migration through legacy service integration into 4G networks and future evolutions","volume":"53","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7263353/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15456681","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7263353/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software defined service migration through legacy service integration into 4G networks and future evolutions","sourcePdf":"020KYUNG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044189S","chronDate":"September  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7263333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7263333","articleId":"7263353","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":7263359,"authors":[{"name":"Minyoung Park","affiliation":["Intel Corporation"],"bio":{"p":["Minyoung Park received B.S. and M.S. degrees from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1993 and 1995, and his Ph.D. degree from the University of Texas at Austin in 2005, all in electrical engineering.

Currently, these meters are designed for low duty cycle billing and occasional system check, which generates low-rate sporadic traffic. As the number of distributed energy resources increases, household power will become more variable and thus unpredictable from the viewpoint of the distribution system operator (DSO). Therefore, it is expected that in the near future there will be an increase in the number of wide area measurement system (WAMS) devices with phasor measurement unit (PMU)-like capabilities in the distribution grid, thus allowing utilities to monitor the low voltage grid quality while providing information required for tighter grid control. From a communication standpoint, the traffic profile will change drastically toward higher data volumes and higher rates per device. In this paper we characterize the current traffic generated by smart electricity meters, and we discuss the potential traffic requirements resulting from the introduction of enhanced smart meters, i.e. meters with PMU-like capabilities. Our study shows how GSM/ GPRS and LTE cellular system performance behaves with current generation and next generation smart meter traffic, where it is clearly seen that the PMU data will seriously challenge these wireless systems. We conclude by highlighting the possible solutions for upgrading the cellular standards, in order to cope with the upcoming smart metering traffic.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7263371/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","volume":"53","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"15456693","publicationDate":"September 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7263371/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"What can wireless cellular technologies do about the upcoming smart metering traffic?","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"What can wireless cellular technologies do about the upcoming smart metering traffic?","sourcePdf":"038NIELSEN_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079892S","chronDate":"September  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7263333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7263333","articleId":"7263371","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7263372,"authors":[{"name":"Akram Hakiri","affiliation":["ISSAT Mateur, Tunisia"],"bio":{"p":["Akram Hakiri(akram.hakirielaasfr) is an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at ISSAT Mateur, and a research scientist at SYSCOM Labs' ENIT, both in Tunisia.

As Internet of Things (IoT) is the fundamental infrastructure to realize urban sensing, it should be flexible to support various application requirements and convenient management of infrastructure. Inspired by software-defined networking, which aims to make networks more flexible, the authors propose a software-defined IoT architecture for smart urban sensing. This architecture decouples urban sensing applications from the physical infrastructure. Centralized controllers are designed to manage physical devices and provide APIs of data acquisition, transmission, and processing services to develop urban sensing applications. With these properties, various applications can coexist on the shared infrastructure, and each application can request controllers to customize its data acquisition, transmission, and processing on-demand by generating specific configurations of physical devices. This article discusses the background, benefits, and design details of the proposed architecture as well as open problems and potential solutions to realize it, which opens a new research direction for IoT and urban sensing.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7263333/07263373.pdf","startPage":"55","endPage":"63","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263373","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263333","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7263373","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Software-defined internet of things for smart urban sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Software radio","Servers","Computer architecture","Data processing","Data acquisition","Internet of things","Market research","Machine-to-machine communications"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["centralised control","data acquisition","data communication","Internet of Things","software defined networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined Internet of Things","smart urban sensing","software-defined networking","software-defined IoT architecture","centralized controller","data acquisition","API","data transmission","data processing service"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7263373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Software-defined internet of things for smart urban sensing","volume":"53","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7263373/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15456678","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Software-defined internet of things for smart urban sensing","sourcePdf":"040LI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052869S","chronDate":"September  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7263333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"7263333","articleId":"7263373","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7263374,"authors":[{"name":"Xiong Xiong","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications"],"bio":{"p":["Xiong Xiong received his B.S. degree from Beijing University of Posts& Telecommunications (BUPT), China, in 2013.

M2M devices can be used for a wide range of emerging applications that have various communications requirements. While M2M communications have been developed for many years, major challenges still remain with their efficient implementation from the perspective of low energy consumption and wide coverage. To address these challenges, low power wide area (LPWA) technology is investigated as one of the potential candidate solutions. In this article, we first introduce some typical LPWA M2M application scenarios. Given their requirements, we highlight key techniques and standards that are explicitly designed for LPWA M2M communications. Finally, we present an LPWA prototype system to evaluate its performance and demonstrate its potential in bridging a technological gap for future Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263374","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263374","startPage":"64","endPage":"71","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7263333/07263374.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low power wide area machine-to-machine networks: key techniques and prototype","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7263374/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Low power wide area machine-to-machine networks: key techniques and prototype","volume":"53","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15456686","publicationDate":"September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7263374/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power wide area machine-to-machine networks: key techniques and prototype","sourcePdf":"041ZHENG_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094713S","chronDate":"September  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7263333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"131","xplore-issue":"7263333","articleId":"7263374","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7263375,"authors":[{"name":"Ala Al-Fuqaha","affiliation":["Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, MI, US"],"bio":{"p":["Ala Al-Fuqaha [S'00, M'04, SM'09] is an associate professor and director of the NEST Research Lab in the Computer Science Department at Western Michigan University.

Each protocol focuses on a specific aspect of IoT communications. The lack of a protocol that can handle the vertical market requirements of IoT applications including machine-to-machine, machine-to-server, and server-to-server communications has resulted in a fragmented market between many protocols. In turn, this fragmentation is a main hindrance in the development of new services that require the integration of multiple IoT services to unlock new capabilities and provide horizontal integration among services. In this work, after articulating the major shortcomings of the current IoT protocols, we outline a rule-based intelligent gateway that bridges the gap between existing IoT protocols to enable the efficient integration of horizontal IoT services. While this intelligent gateway enhances the gloomy picture of protocol fragmentation in the context of IoT, it does not address the root cause of this fragmentation, which lies in the inability of the current protocols to offer a wide range of QoS guarantees. To offer a solution that stems the root cause of this protocol fragmentation issue, we propose a generic IoT protocol that is flexible enough to address the IoT vertical market requirements. In this regard, we enhance the baseline MQTT protocol by allowing it to support rich QoS features by exploiting a mix of IP multicasting, intelligent broker queuing management, and traffic analytics techniques. Our initial evaluation of the lightweight enhanced MQTT protocol reveals significant improvement over the baseline protocol in terms of the delay performance.","doi":"10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263375","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/35/7263333/07263375.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCOM.2015.7263375","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7263333","startPage":"72","endPage":"79","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward better horizontal integration among IoT services","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7263375","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Toward better horizontal integration among IoT services","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7263375/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"9","publicationDate":"September 2015","accessionNumber":"15456690","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7263375/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward better horizontal integration among IoT services","sourcePdf":"042GUIZANI_LAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051365S","chronDate":"September  2015","xplore-pub-id":"35","isNumber":"7263333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"7263333","articleId":"7263375","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7263548,"authors":[{"name":"Jiang Rui","affiliation":["Qujing Normal University, Yunnan Qujing, China"],"firstName":"Jiang","lastName":"Rui","id":"37085567581"},{"name":"Sun Danpeng","affiliation":["Qujing Normal University, Yunnan Qujing, China"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Danpeng","id":"37085568325"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7143-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7142-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-1473"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-1481"}],"articleNumber":"7263548","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3327},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Internet of things","Computers","Computer architecture","Business","Security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","Internet of Things","middleware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet of Thing architecture design","unified Internet of Things operation management system framework","platform middleware layer","cloud computing technology","Internet of Things business operation platform construction scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","cloud computing","platform design"]}],"abstract":"Importance and development advantage of the Internet of Things industry chain is discussed.

For instance, in November 2013 NASA announced the release of hundreds of Terabytes of its earth remote sensing dataset. Such data includes but not limited to: weather maps, socioeconomic data, vegetation indices, geological maps, and more. Making sense of such spatial data will be beneficial for several applications that may transform science and society -- For example: (1) Space Science: that allows astronomers to study and probably discover new features of both the earth and the outer space, (2) Socio-Economic Analysis: that includes for example climate change analysis, study of deforestation, population migration, and variation in sea levels, (3) Urban Planning: assisting government in city planning, road network design, and transportation engineering, (4) Disaster Planning: that helps in assessing the impact of natural disasters. The main aim of this paper is to investigate novel data management techniques that enable interactive and scalable exploration of big spatial data. The paper envisions novel system architectures that provide support for interactive and spatial data exploration, as follows: (1) The paper suggests extending data analytics frameworks, e.g., Apache Spark, to support spatial data types and operations at scale. The resulting framework will serve as a scalable backbone for processing spatial data exploration tasks. (2) It also sketches novel structures and algorithms that leverage modern hardware, e.g., SSDs, and in-memory data processing techniques to efficiently store and access spatial data. Second, the paper proposes extending spatial database systems to support an exploration-aware spatial query evaluation paradigm through three novel components: (1) Spatial Query Steering: that allows the user to slightly modify the query conditions online (zooming in/out) and retrieve the new results in very low latency. (2) Recommendation-Aware Spatial Querying: that injects the recommendation functionality inside classical spatial query executors to support spatial data recommendation. It leverages recommendation algorithms to predict what spatial objects/areas the user would like based on her past interactions with the system. (3) Spatial Query Approximation: That aims at achieving interactive performance by studying the tradeoff between approximate spatial data exploration and query response time.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7264280","publicationTitle":"2015 16th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 16th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management","pdfPath":"/iel7/7263115/7264280/07264331.pdf","doi":"10.1109/MDM.2015.67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MDM.2015.67","startPage":"263","endPage":"270","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interactive and Scalable Exploration of Big Spatial Data -- A Data Management Perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 June 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264331/","displayDocTitle":"Interactive and Scalable Exploration of Big Spatial Data -- A Data Management Perspective","htmlLink":"/document/7264331/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-18 June 2015","isConference":true,"volume":"1","accessionNumber":"15455589","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive and Scalable Exploration of Big Spatial Data -- A Data Management Perspective","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"9972a263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130831S","chronDate":"15-18 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7263115","isNumber":"7264280","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7263115","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7264280","articleId":"7264331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7264723,"authors":[{"name":"Bernhard Wally","affiliation":["Business Informatics Group, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Wally","id":"37704350500"},{"name":"Alexandra Mazak","affiliation":["Business Informatics Group, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Mazak","id":"37397571700"},{"name":"Bernhard Kratzwald","affiliation":["Business Informatics Group, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Bernhard","lastName":"Kratzwald","id":"37085500160"},{"name":"Christian Huemer","affiliation":["Business Informatics Group, University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Huemer","id":"37370932500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7340-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-1963"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2378-1971"}],"articleNumber":"7264723","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"abstract":"Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are often cumbersome to customize to a client's needs. Model-driven approaches promise to simplify these attempts. In this work we present an ERP prototype based on the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) business ontology that follows a \"model-at-runtime\" approach: one may customize the ERP system during runtime by changing the underlying REA models. We are using Retail-H as the reference framework for building a retail information system(RIS). Our main contribution is the prototypical implementation of a domain agnostic REA engine that can be loaded at runtime with domain specific business models -- these models can further be manipulated at runtime. On that basis we have exemplarily modeled main concepts of Retail-H in REA. Validation of the implemented components is realized by applying real business activities and requirements received from our partner, a business software solution provider.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Business","Unified modeling language","Object oriented modeling","Software","Runtime","Information systems","Ontologies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","enterprise resource planning","information systems","multi-agent systems","ontologies (artificial intelligence)","retail data processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model-driven retail information system","REA business ontology","retail-H","enterprise resource planning systems","ERP systems","resource-event-agent business ontology","model-at-runtime approach","domain agnostic REA engine","domain specific business models","business activities","business software solution provider","business requirements"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CBI.2015.49","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 17th Conference on Business Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 17th Conference on Business Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/7259951/7264698/07264723.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"124","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7264698","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CBI.2015.49","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Driven Retail Information System Based on REA Business Ontology and Retail-H","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7264723","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Model-Driven Retail Information System Based on REA Business Ontology and Retail-H","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264723/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7264723/","accessionNumber":"15472617","conferenceDate":"13-16 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-16 July 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Driven Retail Information System Based on REA Business Ontology and Retail-H","confLoc":"Lisbon, Portugal","sourcePdf":"7340a116.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070182S","chronDate":"13-16 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7259951","isNumber":"7264698","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7259951","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7264698","articleId":"7264723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7264814,"authors":[{"name":"Haruki Tokumaru","firstName":"Haruki","lastName":"Tokumaru","id":"37294075700"},{"name":"Masahiko Kishida","firstName":"Masahiko","lastName":"Kishida","id":"37664281600"},{"name":"Daiichi Koide","firstName":"Daiichi","lastName":"Koide","id":"37294080300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-0279"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2160-2492"}],"articleNumber":"7264814","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":2},"doi":"10.5594/J11498","publicationTitle":"SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE Motion Imaging Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7261654/7264803/07264814.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/J11498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7264803","startPage":"24","endPage":"30","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HDTV Optical Disk for Broadcasting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7264814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","displayDocTitle":"HDTV Optical Disk for Broadcasting","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2006","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  2006","isJournal":true,"volume":"115","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2006","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HDTV Optical Disk for Broadcasting","sourcePdf":"10-5594_J11498.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.018162S","chronDate":"Jan.  2006","isNumber":"7264803","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7261654","citationCount":"5","articleId":"7264814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2006","subType":"SMPTE Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7264839,"authors":[{"name":"P.

To achieve ubiquitous data transportation among objects and the surrounding environment, deploying spectrum sharing M2M communications with existing wireless networks is a must. A general large-scale cognitive M2M network (CM2MN), adopting cognitive radio technology, consists of multiradio systems, the primary system (PS), and secondary system(s) with tremendous cooperative cognitive machines, under heterogeneous wireless architecture. For these CM2MNs, due to dynamic spectrum access (DSA) nature, there exists possibly unidirectional opportunistic wireless fading links and thus traditional flow control mechanisms at link level do not fit anymore. Furthermore, effective end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) control is still required to provide a reliable transportation for such multihop CM2M communications. Facing the above challenges, we propose a novel statistical QoS control mechanism through cooperative relaying, realizing virtual multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) communications at session level. In particular, a probabilistic network coded routing algorithm and the statistical QoS guarantee are first proposed to coordinate and cooperate tremendous machines. Next, based on the proposed guarantee and routing algorithm, the statistical QoS control mechanism is designed to enable MIMO communications for the session traffic. Specifically, the diversity mode is used to deal with PS's opportunistic nature and wireless fading, and the spatial multiplexing mode is employed to obtain the maximum end-to-end throughput. Simulation results confirm that under our control solution, the great improvements of end-to-end delay violation probability are obtained, thus practically facilitating network coded multipath routing in large CM2MNs.","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2015.2478435","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7523345","startPage":"619","endPage":"627","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7523345/07264970.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2478435","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical QoS Control of Network Coded Multipath Routing in Large Cognitive Machine-to-Machine Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","MIMO","Routing","Relays","Spread spectrum communication","Delays","Network coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","fading channels","MIMO communication","network coding","probability","quality of service","telecommunication control","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical QoS control","network coded multipath routing","cognitive machine-to-machine networks","smart grid","vehicular safety","health care","ubiquitous data transportation","spectrum sharing","wireless networks","cognitive radio technology","multiradio systems","primary system","secondary system","cooperative cognitive machines","heterogeneous wireless architecture","dynamic spectrum access","wireless fading links","flow control mechanisms","quality-of-service","multiple-input and multiple-output communications","probabilistic network coded routing algorithm","MIMO communications","spatial multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","cooperative relay","effective capacity","machine-to-machine (M2M) communications","network coded multipath routing","statistical quality-of-service (QoS) control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Statistical QoS Control of Network Coded Multipath Routing in Large Cognitive Machine-to-Machine Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/7264970/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16180608","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council, National Taiwan University, and Intel Corporation","grantNumber":"NSC103-2911-I-002-001 and NTU103R7501"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"MOST103-2221-E-002-022-MY3 and MOST104-2221-E-002-082"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical QoS Control of Network Coded Multipath Routing in Large Cognitive Machine-to-Machine Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-lin-2478435-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082238S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7523345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7523345","articleId":"7264970","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7264974,"authors":[{"name":"James S.

The first issue is whether the accurate segmentation of the iris region is required in order to achieve the accurate detection of textured contact lenses. Our experimental results suggest that accurate iris segmentation is not required. The second issue is whether an algorithm trained on the images acquired from one sensor will well generalize to the images acquired from a different sensor. Our results suggest that using a novel iris sensor can significantly degrade the correct classification rate of a detection algorithm trained with the images from a different sensor. The third issue is how well a detector generalizes to a brand of textured contact lenses, not seen in the training data. This paper shows that a novel textured lens type may have a significant impact on the performance of textured lens detection.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15494228","volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7264974/","publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Robust Detection of Textured Contact Lenses in Iris Recognition Using BSIF","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Robust Detection of Textured Contact Lenses in Iris Recognition Using BSIF","sourcePdf":"access-doyle-2477470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111436S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7264974","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":7264975,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Xu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7264975/weixu-2478720-small.gif","p":["Wei Xu (S\u201907\u2013M\u201909\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in communication and information engineering from the Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2003, 2006, and 2009, respectively.

Due to CSI quantization errors and/or limited feedback information, CSI imperfections can be well modeled by a bounded uncertainty region. We focus on the worst case robust beamforming strategy to optimize the EE of downlink transmission under the deterministic bounded channel model, which merely assumes a maximal channel error magnitude. We start with a single-user single-cell MIMO system and obtain a closed-form design for robust beamforming. For a multicell network, robust beamforming is in a nonconvex fractional form, and the solution cannot be directly extended from the single-cell scenario. To solve this problem efficiently, we resort to a lower bound, instead of the primal problem, and cast it as a semidefinite program (SDP). The robustness and efficiency of the proposed beamforming design are confirmed by computer simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2478720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07264975.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2478720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","startPage":"2920","endPage":"2935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Beamforming With Partial Channel State Information for Energy Efficient Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7264975","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Robust Beamforming With Partial Channel State Information for Energy Efficient Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264975/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"33","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602346","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7264975/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China NSFC","grantNumber":"61471114, 61461136003, 61501110 and 61571118"},{"fundingName":"973 program","grantNumber":"2013CB329203"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu, China","grantNumber":"BK20150635"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Beamforming With Partial Channel State Information for Energy Efficient Networks","sourcePdf":"jsac-xu-2478720-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.173657S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7264975","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7264976,"authors":[{"name":"Matthieu Bloch","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/7270357/7264976/bloch-2463678-small.gif","p":["\nMatthieu Bloch (Member, IEEE) received the Engineering degree from Sup\u00e9lec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA, in 2003, the Ph.D. degree in engineering science from the Universit\u00e9 de Franche-Comt\u00e9, Besan\u00e7on, France, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 2008.","He is an Associate Professor in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology.

In addition to ensuring reliability, carefully designed codes have been shown to provide a level of information-theoretic secrecy, by which the amount of information leaked to an adversary may be controlled. The ability to achieve information-theoretic secrecy relies on the study of alternative coding mechanisms, such as channel resolvability and privacy amplification, in which error-control codes are exploited as a means to shape the distribution of stochastic processes. This use of error-control codes, which goes much beyond that of correcting errors, creates numerous new design challenges. The objective of this paper is threefold. First, the paper aims at providing system engineers with explicit tools to build simple secrecy codes in order to stimulate interest and foster their integration in communication system prototypes. Second, it aims at providing coding and information theorists with a synthetic overview of the theoretical concepts and techniques for secrecy. Finally, it aims at highlighting the open challenges and opportunities faced for the integration of these codes in practical systems.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2463678","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the

Wide open eye diagrams are demonstrated at 1610 nm operation wavelength for nonreturn-to-zero on-off keying (NRZ-OOK) modulation at data rates as high as 56 Gb/s. Dynamic extinction ratios up to 3.3 dB are obtained by applying drive voltages of 2 V peak-to-peak, along with an optical insertion loss below 5.5 dB. The device has a low junction capacitance of just 12.8 fF, resulting in 12.8 fJ/bit of dynamic and ~1.2 mW of static power consumption in typical operating conditions. Wafer-scale performance data are presented and confirm the manufacturability of the device.

Major applications of image fusion are in navigation and military. Here, infrared and visible sensors are used to capture complementary images of the targeted scene. The complementary information of these source images has to be integrated into a single image using some fusion algorithms. The aim of any fusion method is to transfer maximum information from the source images to the fused image with a minimum information loss. It has to minimize the artifacts in the fused image. In this paper, we propose a new edge preserving image fusion method for infrared and visible sensor images. Anisotropic diffusion is used to decompose the source images into approximation and detail layers. Final detail and approximation layers are calculated with the help of Karhunen-Loeve transform and weighted linear superposition, respectively. A fused image is generated from the linear combination of final detail and approximation layers. Performance of the proposed algorithm is assessed with the help of petrovic metrics. The results of the proposed algorithm are compared with the traditional and recent image fusion algorithms. Results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7352393","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2015.2478655","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7352393/07264981.pdf","startPage":"203","endPage":"209","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2478655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fusion of Infrared and Visible Sensor Images Based on Anisotropic Diffusion and Karhunen-Loeve Transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1,  2016","displayDocTitle":"Fusion of Infrared and Visible Sensor Images Based on Anisotropic Diffusion and Karhunen-Loeve Transform","volume":"16","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7264981/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.1, 2016","accessionNumber":"15677561","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264981/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fusion of Infrared and Visible Sensor Images Based on Anisotropic Diffusion and Karhunen-Loeve Transform","sourcePdf":"jsen-bavirisetti-2478655-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068971S","chronDate":"Jan.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"7352393","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"100","xplore-issue":"7352393","articleId":"7264981","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-09"},{"_id":7264984,"authors":[{"name":"Jeongho Kwak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada","INRS-EMT, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada","School of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/49/7330054/7264984/jkwak-2478718-small.gif","p":["Jeongho Kwak (S\u201911\u2013M\u201915) received the B.S. degree (summa cum laude) in electrical and computer engineering from Ajou University, Suwon-si, South Korea, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2008, 2011, and 2015, respectively.

However, real network environments are spatio-temporally varying, and typical mobile devices have not only various types of tasks, e.g., network traffic, cloud offloadable/nonoffloadable workloads but also capabilities of CPU frequency scaling and network interface selection between WiFi and cellular. In this paper, we first jointly consider the following three dynamic problems in real mobile environments: 1) cloud offloading policy, i.e., determining to use local CPU resources or cloud resources; 2) allocation of tasks to transmit through networks and to process in local CPU; and 3) CPU clock speed and network interface controls. We propose a DREAM algorithm by invoking the Lyapunov optimization and mathematically prove that it minimizes CPU and network energy for given delay constraints. Trace-driven simulation based on real measurements demonstrates that DREAM can save over 35% of total energy than existing algorithms with the same delay. We also design DREAM architecture and demonstrate the applicability of DREAM in practice.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264984/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","volume":"33","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15602345","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7264984/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DREAM: Dynamic Resource and Task Allocation for Energy Minimization in Mobile Cloud Systems","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Institute for Information and Communications Technology Promotion (IITP)"},{"fundingName":"Korea government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"B0190-15-2017"},{"fundingName":"Resilient/Fault-Tolerant Autonomic Networking Based on Physicality"},{"fundingName":"Relationship and Service Semantic of IoT Devices"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DREAM: Dynamic Resource and Task Allocation for Energy Minimization in Mobile Cloud Systems","sourcePdf":"jsac-kwak-2478718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095404S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"254","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7264984","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7264986,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Boshkovska","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Boshkovska","id":"37085633066"},{"name":"Derrick Wing Kwan Ng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Kensington, N.S.W., Australia"],"firstName":"Derrick Wing Kwan","lastName":"Ng","id":"37536288000"},{"name":"Nikola Zlatanov","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Zlatanov","id":"38570103500"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7264986","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":478,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":6446},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless communication","Integrated circuit modeling","Receivers","Optimization","Wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concave programming","energy harvesting","iterative methods","nonlinear programming","radio receivers","radiofrequency power transmission","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear energy harvesting model","SWIPT system","simultaneous wireless information and power transfer system","nonconvex optimization problem","total harvested power maximization","energy harvesting receiver","minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio","multiple information receivers","nonconvex objective function","iterative resource allocation algorithm","rank-constrained semidefinite program","SDP relaxation"]},{"kwd":["Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer","non-linear energy harvesting model"]}],"abstract":"In this letter, we propose a practical non-linear energy harvesting model and design a resource allocation algorithm for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) systems. The algorithm design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem for the maximization of the total harvested power at energy harvesting receivers subject to minimum required signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratios (SINRs) at multiple information receivers. We transform the considered non-convex objective function from sum-of-ratios form into an equivalent objective function in subtractive form, which enables the derivation of an efficient iterative resource allocation algorithm. In each iteration, a rank-constrained semidefinite program (SDP) is solved optimally by SDP relaxation. Numerical results unveil a substantial performance gain that can be achieved if the resource allocation design is based on the proposed non-linear energy harvesting model instead of the traditional linear model.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2478460","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7349260/07264986.pdf","startPage":"2082","endPage":"2085","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7349260","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2478460","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical Non-Linear Energy Harvesting Model and Resource Allocation for SWIPT Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7264986","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Practical Non-Linear Energy Harvesting Model and Resource Allocation for SWIPT Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264986/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15661696","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7264986/","volume":"19","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical Non-Linear Energy Harvesting Model and Resource Allocation for SWIPT Systems","sourcePdf":"lcomm-ng-2478460-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043175S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7349260","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"478","xplore-issue":"7349260","articleId":"7264986","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7264992,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Chin Ang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8857/7585042/7264992/chin-2478454-small.gif","p":["Jun Chin Ang received the BSc and MSc degrees in computer science\n from the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM).

Gene expression microarray data comprises up to hundreds of thousands of features with relatively small sample size. Because learning algorithms usually do not work well with this kind of data, a challenge to reduce the data dimensionality arises. A huge number of gene selection are applied to select a subset of relevant features for model construction and to seek for better cancer classification performance. This paper presents the basic taxonomy of feature selection, and also reviews the state-of-the-art gene selection methods by grouping the literatures into three categories: supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised. The comparison of experimental results on top 5 representative gene expression datasets indicates that the classification accuracy of unsupervised and semi-supervised feature selection is competitive with supervised feature selection.","doi":"10.1109/TCBB.2015.2478454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7585042","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2015.2478454","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/8857/7585042/07264992.pdf","startPage":"971","endPage":"989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-Supervised Feature Selection: A Review on Gene Selection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-Supervised Feature Selection: A Review on Gene Selection","volume":"13","issue":"5","chronOrPublicationDate":"September 1 2016","dateOfInsertion":"06 October 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7264992/","publicationDate":"1 September 2016","accessionNumber":"16374270","pubMedId":"26390495","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264992/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM)"},{"fundingName":"Dhofar University"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Supervised, Unsupervised, and Semi-Supervised Feature Selection: A Review on Gene Selection","sourcePdf":"tcbb-ang-2478454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.355082S","chronDate":"September 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"8857","isNumber":"7585042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8857","citationCount":"219","xplore-issue":"7585042","articleId":"7264992","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-21"},{"_id":7264995,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Li","affiliation":["Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Urbanization and Geo-Simulation, School of Geography and Planning, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4609443/7404297/7264995/junli-2470129-small.gif","p":["Jun Li (M\u201913) received the B.S. degree in geographic information systems from Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China, in 2004, the M.E. degree in remote sensing from Peking University, Beijing, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico (IST), Universidade T\u00e9cnica de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal, in 2011.","From 2007 to 2011, she was a Marie Curie Research Fellow with the Departamento de Engenharia Electrotcnica e de Computadores and the Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, IST, Universidade T\u00e9cnica de Lisboa, in the framework of the European Doctorate for Signal Processing (SIGNAL).

In recent years, relaxation methods have shown great success in classification of remotely sensed data. Relaxation, as a preprocessing step, can reduce noise and improve the class separability in the spectral domain. On the other hand, relaxation (as a postprocessing approach) works on the label image or class probabilities obtained from pixelwise classifiers. In this work, we develop a discontinuity preserving relaxation strategy, which can be used for postprocessing of class probability estimates, as well as preprocessing of the original hyperspectral image. The newly proposed method is an iterative relaxation procedure, which exploits spatial information in such a way that it considers discontinuities existing in the data cube. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed methodology leads to state-of-the-art classification results when combined with probabilistic classifiers for several widely used hyperspectral data sets, even when very limited training samples are available.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Discontinuity Preserving Relaxation Scheme for Spectral\u2013Spatial Hyperspectral Image Classification","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2470129","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/7404297/07264995.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2015.2470129","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7404297","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7264995","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7264995/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Discontinuity Preserving Relaxation Scheme for Spectral\u2013Spatial Hyperspectral Image Classification","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"9","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7264995/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15775370","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001871","fundingName":"Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia","grantNumber":"UID/EEA/50008/2013 and PTDC/EEI-PRO/1470/2012"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41431178"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Discontinuity Preserving Relaxation Scheme for Spectral\u2013Spatial Hyperspectral Image Classification","sourcePdf":"jstars-li-2470129-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086067S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"7404297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"7404297","articleId":"7264995","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":7265001,"authors":[{"name":"Richa Bharadwaj","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8/7312523/7265001/bhara-2478455-small.gif","p":["Richa Bharadwaj (S\u201912) received the Bachelors of Engineering degree (with Hons.) in electronics and communication from Panjab University, Chandigarh, India, in 2008, the M.S. degree in micro and nanotechnologies for integrated systems from Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy; INPG Grenoble, Grenoble, France, and EPFL Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electronic engineering (specialised in ultra-wideband technology) from the School of Electronics and Computer Science (Antennas and Electromagnetics Research Group), Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K., in 2015.","She has authored a number of research papers in leading international journals and peer-reviewed conferences.

Three-dimensional (3-D) tracking of wearable antennas placed on the upper human body is achieved using a compact and cost-effective antenna and time of arrival (TOA) localization techniques. Various features such as rms delay spread, kurtosis, and signal amplitude have been used to classify the channel type between each antenna location and base station. Non-line-of-sight identification and mitigation techniques have been used to enhance the accuracy of the localization technique applied. Geometric dilution of precision of the base-station configuration and numerical analysis on the radiation patterns for different locations of the body-worn antenna has been studied in terms of variation in localization accuracy. High-accuracy 3-D localization results in the range of 1-2 cm are obtained with the antennas placed on the limbs and 1-3 cm for the torso region. The accuracy achieved is 3 times better than commercially available UWB localization and tracking systems. The significantly high-accuracy results obtained for all antenna locations demonstrate the reliability and suitability of UWB technology for various indoor tracking and localization applications in the fields of healthcare, sports, and well-being.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2478455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2478455","startPage":"5035","endPage":"5044","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7312523/07265001.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7312523","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental Investigation of 3-D Human Body Localization Using Wearable Ultra-Wideband Antennas","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Experimental Investigation of 3-D Human Body Localization Using Wearable Ultra-Wideband Antennas","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 October 2015","volume":"63","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7265001/","accessionNumber":"15568445","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265001/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100009148","fundingName":"Queen Mary University of London Principle\u2019s Doctoral Scholarship"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), U.K."}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental Investigation of 3-D Human Body Localization Using Wearable Ultra-Wideband Antennas","sourcePdf":"tap-bharadwaj-2478455-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072338S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7312523","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7312523","articleId":"7265001","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7265005,"authors":[{"name":"Gyanendra Prasad Joshi","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Gyanendra Prasad","lastName":"Joshi","id":"37320306600"},{"name":"Sung Won Kim","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung Won","lastName":"Kim","orcid":"0000-0001-8454-6980","id":"37279276600"},{"name":"Seung Yeob Nam","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Engineering, Yeungnam University, Gyeongsan, Korea"],"firstName":"Seung Yeob","lastName":"Nam","id":"37274660700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7265005","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":497},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Routing protocols","Routing","Delays","Cognitive radio","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cognitive radio","protocols","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc cognitive radio networks","routing layer solution","frequent channel switching mitigation","cross-layer-based routing","noncross-layer-based protocols"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","routing protocols","cross-layer","channel switching delay"]},{"kwd":["Cognitive radio networks","routing protocols","cross-layer","channel switching delay"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Routing Layer Solution for Mitigating Frequent Channel Switching in Ad Hoc Cognitive Radio Networks","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2478781","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322307","endPage":"1920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7322307/07265005.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2478781","startPage":"1917","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265005","abstract":"This letter analytically shows the requirements of cross-layer-based routing in ad hoc cognitive radio networks.

Due to the severe attenuation of molecule concentrations, there tends to be more errors when the receiver becomes farther from the transmitter. To solve this problem, relaying schemes need to be implemented to achieve reliable communications. In this letter, time-dependent molecular concentrations are utilised as the information carrier, which will be influenced by the noise and channel memory. The emission process is also considered. The relay node (RN) can decode messages, and forward them by sending either the same or a different kind of molecules as the transmitter. The performance is evaluated by deriving theoretical expressions as well as through simulations. Results show that the relaying scheme will bring significant benefits to the communication reliability.","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2478780","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7322307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2478780","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7322307/07265013.pdf","startPage":"1977","endPage":"1980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Analysis in Molecular Communications With Time-Dependent Concentration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Relay Analysis in Molecular Communications With Time-Dependent Concentration","volume":"19","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7265013/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15587178","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265013/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Analysis in Molecular Communications With Time-Dependent Concentration","sourcePdf":"lcomm-wang-2478780-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086409S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7322307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7322307","articleId":"7265013","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7265015,"authors":[{"name":"David Flynn","affiliation":["BlackBerry Ltd., Waterloo, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["David Flynn received the B.Eng. degree in computer systems engineering from University of Warwick, Warwick, U.K., in 2005.","He was with the Research and Development Department, British Broadcasting Corporation, London, U.K. He is currently with Blackberry Ltd., Waterloo, ON, Canada.

This set of extensions targets video coding applications in areas including content acquisition, postproduction, contribution, distribution, archiving, medical imaging, still imaging, and screen content. In addition to the functionality of HEVC Version 1, RExt provide support for monochrome, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4 chroma sampling formats as well as increased sample bit depths beyond 10 bits per sample. This extended functionality includes new coding tools with a view to provide additional coding efficiency, greater flexibility, and throughput at high bit depths/rates. Improved lossless, near-lossless, and very high bit-rate coding is also a part of the RExt scope. This paper presents the technical aspects of HEVC RExt, including a discussion of RExt profiles, tools, applications, and provides experimental results for a performance comparison with previous relevant coding technology. When compared with the High 4:4:4 Predictive Profile of H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC), the corresponding HEVC 4:4:4 RExt profile provides up to ~25$ %, ~32%, and ~36% average bit-rate reduction at the same PSNR quality level for intra, random access, and low delay configurations, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2478707","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2015.2478707","startPage":"4","endPage":"19","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7372356/07265015.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7372356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of the Range Extensions for the HEVC Standard: Tools, Profiles, and Performance","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Overview of the Range Extensions for the HEVC Standard: Tools, Profiles, and Performance","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"05 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15689045","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7265015/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Overview of the Range Extensions for the HEVC Standard: Tools, Profiles, and Performance","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-marpe-2478707-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125766S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7372356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7372356","articleId":"7265015","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7265019,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-Ha Song","affiliation":["Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Yong-Ha","lastName":"Song","id":"37085626590"},{"name":"Songbin Gong","affiliation":["Micro and Nanotechnology Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Songbin","lastName":"Gong","id":"37953311000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0741-3106"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0563"}],"articleNumber":"7265019","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":876},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"abstract":"This letter reports on a spurious mode suppression technique for the shear horizontal (SH0) mode lithium niobate laterally vibrating resonators. The concept utilizes triangular and arched edge shapes on the transversal sides of a resonant cavity to effectively distribute and scatter the acoustic waves in the inactive regions, yielding the suppression of transverse spurious modes. 2D models and 3D finite-element analyses were employed to theoretically verify the technique. For devices with the archedshape edges, complete removal of higher order transverse modes has been experimentally demonstrated with 2\u00d7 enhancement for quality factor (Q). The Q enhancement arises from the improved concentration of mechanical energy under the inter-digitated transducers.

The proposed control technique utilizes the discrete behavior of the converter, considering the unavoidable quantization errors between the controller and the control actions selected from the finite control set of the bidirectional ac-dc converter. The proposed control method reduces the execution time delay by 18% compared with the conventional model predictive control. Moreover, the nonlinear system stability of the proposed MMPC technique is ensured by the direct Lyapunov method and a nonlinear experimental system model.

A switching control strategy is developed using a space vector pulsewidth modulation scheme. The number of vectors per switching cycle is optimized to five, and changes in the control strategy depending on the two capacitor voltage differences are only allowed to take place at the start of each switching cycle. This helps in reducing the switching losses. A detailed analysis on the larger capacitor voltage deviation at high modulation index and leading power factor is analyzed, and four control strategies are developed to reduce it. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink platform, and an experimental setup is developed using a DSpace\u00ae-based real-time emulator.

In addition to the regular measurements, the damper bar currents are measured and used to obtain the stator-to-damper transfer functions. The test is performed three times with physically different damper winding configurations. An extension to the standard SSFR test analysis scheme is suggested, where the stator-to-damper transfer functions are included. The validity of the identified models is substantiated by comparison of the simulated and measured machine response to a drive torque step disturbance. It is found that the damper winding measurements can be incorporated in the analysis scheme to isolate the effect of the damper circuits.

However, as the data tensor often has multiple modes and is large scale, the existing NTD algorithms suffer from a very high computational complexity in terms of both storage and computation time, which has been one major obstacle for practical applications of NTD. To overcome these disadvantages, we show how low (multilinear) rank approximation (LRA) of tensors is able to significantly simplify the computation of the gradients of the cost function, upon which a family of efficient first-order NTD algorithms are developed. Besides dramatically reducing the storage complexity and running time, the new algorithms are quite flexible and robust to noise, because any well-established LRA approaches can be applied. We also show how nonnegativity incorporating sparsity substantially improves the uniqueness property and partially alleviates the curse of dimensionality of the Tucker decompositions. Simulation results on synthetic and real-world data justify the validity and high efficiency of the proposed NTD algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2478396","startPage":"4990","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07265046.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2478396","endPage":"5003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions: Algorithms and Uniqueness","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265046/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions: Algorithms and Uniqueness","volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7265046/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15472745","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","pubMedId":"26390455","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research through the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science","grantNumber":"26730125 and 15K15955"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"U1201253"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014A030308009"},{"fundingName":"Guangdong Province Excellent Thesis Foundation","grantNumber":"SYBZZXM201316"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Nonnegative Tucker Decompositions: Algorithms and Uniqueness","sourcePdf":"tip-zhou-2478396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121086S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7265046","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7265050,"authors":[{"name":"Wen-Hua Chen","affiliation":["Department of Aeronautical and Automotive Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough,, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7377137/7265050/chen-2478397-small.gif","p":["Wen-Hua Chen (SM'06) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Northeast University, Shenyang, China, in 1989 and 1991, respectively.","From 1991 to 1996, he was a Lecturer and then Associate Professor with the Department of Automatic Control, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China.

This survey, at first time, gives a systematic and comprehensive tutorial and summary on the existing disturbance/uncertainty estimation and attenuation techniques, most notably, DOBC, active disturbance rejection control, disturbance accommodation control, and composite hierarchical antidisturbance control. In all of these methods, disturbance and uncertainty are, in general, lumped together, and an observation mechanism is employed to estimate the total disturbance. This paper first reviews a number of widely used linear and nonlinear disturbance/uncertainty estimation techniques and then discusses and compares various compensation techniques and the procedures of integrating disturbance/uncertainty compensation with a (predesigned) linear/nonlinear controller. It also provides concise tutorials of the main methods in this area with clear descriptions of their features. The application of this group of methods in various industrial sections is reviewed, with emphasis on the commercialization of some algorithms. The survey is ended with the discussion of future directions.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2478397","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07265050.pdf","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1095","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2478397","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Disturbance-Observer-Based Control and Related Methods\u2014An Overview","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Disturbance-Observer-Based Control and Related Methods\u2014An Overview","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265050/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15697165","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7265050/","volume":"63","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"GR/N31580"},{"fundingName":"Ph.D. Program Foundation of Ministry of Education of China","grantNumber":"20120092120031"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province","grantNumber":"BK2012327"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2013M540406 and 2014T70455"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Disturbance-Observer-Based Control and Related Methods\u2014An Overview","sourcePdf":"tie-chen-2478397-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121448S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"1053","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7265050","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7265055,"authors":[{"name":"Mauro Conti","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Matematica, Universit\u00e0 di Padova, Padua, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7313073/7265055/conti-2478741-small.gif","p":["Mauro Conti (SM'14) received the Ph.D. degree from the Sapienza University of Rome, Italy, in 2009.

In most attack scenarios, the adversary takes the local or remote control of the mobile device, by leveraging a vulnerability of the system, hence sending back the collected information to some remote web service. In this paper, we consider a different adversary, who does not interact actively with the mobile device, but he is able to eavesdrop the network traffic of the device from the network side (e.g., controlling a Wi-Fi access point). The fact that the network traffic is often encrypted makes the attack even more challenging. In this paper, we investigate to what extent such an external attacker can identify the specific actions that a user is performing on her mobile apps. We design a system that achieves this goal using advanced machine learning techniques. We built a complete implementation of this system, and we also run a thorough set of experiments, which show that our attack can achieve accuracy and precision higher than 95%, for most of the considered actions. We compared our solution with the three state-of-the-art algorithms, and confirming that our system outperforms all these direct competitors.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2478741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2478741","startPage":"114","endPage":"125","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7313073/07265055.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analyzing Android Encrypted Network Traffic to Identify User Actions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265055/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analyzing Android Encrypted Network Traffic to Identify User Actions","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"15582863","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7265055/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"TENACE PRIN Project through the Italian Ministry of Education, University and Research","grantNumber":"20103P34XC"},{"fundingName":"European Commission Directorate General Home Affairs through the GAINS Project","grantNumber":"HOME/2013/CIPS/AG/4000005057"},{"fundingName":"European Commission through the H2020 SUNFISH Project","grantNumber":"644666"},{"fundingName":"EU-India REACH Project","grantNumber":"ICI+/2014/342-896"},{"fundingName":"Project entitled Tackling Mobile Malware with Innovative Machine Learning Techniques through the University of Padua"},{"fundingName":"Marie Curie Fellowship through the European Commission","grantNumber":"PCIG11-GA-2012-321980"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing Android Encrypted Network Traffic to Identify User Actions","sourcePdf":"tifs-verde-2478741-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116802S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7313073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"122","xplore-issue":"7313073","articleId":"7265055","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7265056,"authors":[{"name":"Weigang Hou","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/8306164/7265056/hou-2477778-small.gif","p":["Weigang Hou received the Ph.D. degree in communication and information systems from Northeastern University, Shenyang, China, in 2013.

To solve this problem proactively, most of the existing studies have been based on server consolidation, with the main objective of minimizing the number of active servers. Although this approach can minimize resource fragmentation at a particular time, it may be over aggressive at the price of too frequent VM migration and low system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel provident resource defragmentation framework that is revenue-oriented with the goal to reduce unnecessary VM migration. Within the proposed framework, we formulate an optimization problem for resource defragmentation at a particular time epoch, with the consideration of the future impact of any VM migration. We then develop an efficient heuristic algorithm that can obtain near-optimal results. Extensive numerical results confirm that our framework can provide the highest profit and can significantly reduce the VM migration cost in practical scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265056/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2018","accessionNumber":"17600239","htmlLink":"/document/7265056/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 May 2019","volume":"6","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Provident Resource Defragmentation Framework for Mobile Cloud Computing","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of Hong Kong","grantNumber":"CityU 120612"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Oriental Scholar Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61401082 and 61471109"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Provident Resource Defragmentation Framework for Mobile Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tetc-lu-2477778-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116305S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"8306164","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"8306164","articleId":"7265056","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7265059,"authors":[{"name":"Xufeng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/7313073/7265059/lin-2478748-small.gif","p":["Xufeng Lin received the B.E. degree in electronic and information engineering from the Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, China, in 2009, and the M.E. degree in signal and information processing from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2012.

Therefore, it is desirable and necessary to suppress these unwanted artifacts so as to improve the accuracy and reliability. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing approach for attenuating the influence of the non-unique artifacts on the reference SPN to reduce the false identification rate. Specifically, we equalize the magnitude spectrum of the reference SPN through detecting and suppressing the peaks according to the local characteristics, aiming at removing the interfering periodic artifacts. Combined with six SPN extractions or enhancement methods, our proposed spectrum equalization algorithm is evaluated on the Dresden image database as well as our own database, and compared with the state-of-the-art preprocessing schemes. The experimental results indicate that the proposed procedure outperforms, or at least performs comparable with, the existing methods in terms of the overall receiver operating characteristic curves and kappa statistic computed from a confusion matrix, and tends to be more resistant to JPEG compression for medium and small image blocks.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2478748","startPage":"126","endPage":"140","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7313073/07265059.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2478748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7313073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Preprocessing Reference Sensor Pattern Noise via Spectrum Equalization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Cameras","Discrete Fourier transforms","Transform coding","Image coding","Forensics","Digital images"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cameras","image coding","image enhancement","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reference sensor pattern noise preprocessing","digital cameras","in-camera processing procedures","false identification rate","periodic artifacts","SPN extractions","enhancement methods","spectrum equalization algorithm","Dresden image database","receiver operating characteristic curves","kappa statistics","confusion matrix","JPEG compression","image blocks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multimedia forensics","source camera identification (SCI)","sensor pattern noise","spectrum equalization","PRNU"]},{"kwd":["Multimedia forensics","source camera identification (SCI)","sensor pattern noise","spectrum equalization","PRNU"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265059/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Preprocessing Reference Sensor Pattern Noise via Spectrum Equalization","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7265059/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15568290","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU FP7 Digital Image Video Forensics project (Grant Agreement 251677, Acronym: DIVeFor)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Preprocessing Reference Sensor Pattern Noise via Spectrum Equalization","sourcePdf":"tifs-lin-2478748-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087656S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"7313073","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7313073","articleId":"7265059","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7265060,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Hou","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"bio":{"p":["Jie Hou received the Dr. Ing. degree from the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany, in 2014.

In this paper, we build a link model with a Wiener process to predict the probability of link availability, which considers the stable and unstable vehicle states according to the behavior of vehicles. We introduce a novel concept called the link correlation which represents the influence of different link combinations in network topology to transmit a packet with less network resource consumption and higher goodput. Based on this concept, we design an opportunistic routing metric called the expected transmission cost over a multi-hop path (ETCoP) implemented with our link model as the selection guidance of a relaying node in intra-streets. This metric can also provide assistance for the next street selection at an intersection. Finally, we propose a street-centric opportunistic routing protocol based on ETCoP for VANETs (SRPE). Simulation results show that our proposed SRPE outperforms the conventional protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and network yield.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Street-Centric Opportunistic Routing Protocol Based on Link Correlation for Urban VANETs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2478452","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7484375/07265061.pdf","startPage":"1586","endPage":"1599","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2478452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265061/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"A Street-Centric Opportunistic Routing Protocol Based on Link Correlation for Urban VANETs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7265061/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2016","publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16070189","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61379130 and 61073185"},{"fundingName":"National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University","grantNumber":"2014D06 and 2010D15"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Street-Centric Opportunistic Routing Protocol Based on Link Correlation for Urban VANETs","sourcePdf":"tmc-zhang-2478452-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103374S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7484375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"7484375","articleId":"7265061","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7265064,"authors":[{"name":"Hesen Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Hesen Liu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China, in 2005.

With the increasing availability of wide-area measurements and the rapid development of system identification techniques, it is possible to identify a measurement-based transfer function model online that can be used to tune the oscillation damping controller. Such a model could capture all dominant oscillation modes for adaptive and coordinated oscillation damping control. This paper describes a comprehensive approach to identify a low-order transfer function model of a power system using a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) autoregressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX) model. This methodology consists of five steps: 1) input selection; 2) output selection; 3) identification trigger; 4) model estimation; and 5) model validation. The proposed method is validated by using ambient data and ring-down data in the 16-machine 68-bus Northeast Power Coordinating Council system. The results demonstrate that the measurement-based model using MIMO ARMAX can capture all the dominant oscillation modes. Compared with the MIMO subspace state space model, the MIMO ARMAX model has equivalent accuracy but lower order and improved computational efficiency. The proposed model can be applied for adaptive and coordinated oscillation damping control.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7904756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSG.2015.2470648","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid","pdfPath":"/iel7/5165411/7904756/07265064.pdf","startPage":"1105","endPage":"1115","doi":"10.1109/TSG.2015.2470648","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ARMAX-Based Transfer Function Model Identification Using Wide-Area Measurement for Adaptive and Coordinated Damping Control","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5165411/7904756/7265064-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2017","displayDocTitle":"ARMAX-Based Transfer Function Model Identification Using Wide-Area Measurement for Adaptive and Coordinated Damping Control","volume":"8","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7265064/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2017","accessionNumber":"16823587","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265064/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"Electric Power Research Institute, Engineering Research Center Shared Facilities through the Department of Energy under National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"EEC1041877"},{"fundingName":"CURENT Industry Partnership Program"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"ARMAX-Based Transfer Function Model Identification Using Wide-Area Measurement for Adaptive and Coordinated Damping Control","sourcePdf":"tsg-zhu-2470648-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086492S","chronDate":"May  2017","xplore-pub-id":"5165411","isNumber":"7904756","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5165411","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7904756","articleId":"7265064","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7265076,"authors":[{"name":"Ti-Wen Tang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan","MediaTek Inc., Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"p":["Ti-Wen Tang was born in Tainan, Taiwan.

These schemes require a channel feedback, but at an extremely low rate. The first scheme is based on user selection and can be easily implemented in the existing MIMO-MAC systems. Upper bounds on the minimal computational complexity required by sphere decoders to decode DMT-optimal codes for this scheme as well as for MIMO MAC without feedback are given. It is shown that this scheme can offer both a much larger DMT and an exponential reduction on decoding complexity, compared with the latter. The second scheme selects jointly the users and their transmit antennas. It requires an additional design of rate assignments for performance optimization. A very general framework on the design of optimal rate assignments is thus provided. It is shown that this scheme can yield DMT performances far superior to the optimal MIMO-MAC DMT without channel feedback. The simulation results confirm that in some cases, this scheme can provide an astonishing SNR gain of 14.64 dB at outage probability 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n compared with the optimal MIMO-MAC coding schemes without feedback.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/7299738/07265076.pdf","startPage":"5948","endPage":"5975","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2015.2478472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2015.2478472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299738","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265076","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selection and Rate-Adaptation Schemes for MIMO Multiple-Access Channels With Low-Rate Channel Feedback","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Decoding","Transmitting antennas","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Receiving antennas","Multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","MIMO communication","multiplexing","probability","telecommunication network reliability","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO multiple access channel","low-rate channel feedback","rate-adaptation scheme","user selection scheme","coded transmission","multiple-input multiple-output MAC system","higher diversity-multiplexing gain tradeoff performance","minimal computational complexity","sphere decoder","exponential reduction","decoding complexity","transmitting antenna","SNR gain","outage probability","gain 14.64 dB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO multiple-access channel","feedback channel","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","selection algorithm","rate adaptation"]},{"kwd":["MIMO multiple-access channel","feedback channel","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","selection algorithm","rate adaptation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265076/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Selection and Rate-Adaptation Schemes for MIMO Multiple-Access Channels With Low-Rate Channel Feedback","volume":"61","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7265076/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524596","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 101-2923-E-009-001-MY3 and MOST 103-2221-E- 009-043-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selection and Rate-Adaptation Schemes for MIMO Multiple-Access Channels With Low-Rate Channel Feedback","sourcePdf":"tit-lu-2478472-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.229686S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"7299738","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7299738","articleId":"7265076","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7265080,"authors":[{"name":"Ivan Dokmani\u0107","affiliation":["LCAV-IC-EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7343816/7265080/7265080-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ivan Dokmani\u0107 (S'04\u2013M'14) received a doctorate in communication sciences from Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in 2015.

In this paper, we propose an accurate and precise stochastic online estimation method of the parameters of the traffic lights operating at a piecewise constant period. In this paper, we first model the traffic lights with a semi-hidden Markov model (SHMM) and then develop the period measurement model governed by a unique noise model specific to the indirect traffic light period measurements. The proposed method solves the estimation problem in two stages: in the first stage, we determine the sequence of the Markovian states maximizing the probability given the measurements and the SHMM parameters; then, in the second stage, we update the period and state duration estimates based on the Bayesian tracking given the corresponding latest measurements. The simulation and real vehicle data results prove that the proposed method can accurately estimate the switching times and the period of the piecewise fixed-period traffic lights.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7725562/07265082.pdf","startPage":"2998","endPage":"3008","publicationTitle":"IEEE

To analyze the magnetic resonator, the finite-difference time-domain method in a 2-D transverse magnetic mode is used with a Gaussian pulse source and perfectly matched layers. The topology optimization using solid isotropic material with the penalization method of a magnetic resonator is conducted to maximize magnetic energy. After these approaches, the fast Fourier transform is used to obtain the response of the magnetic resonator system over a wide range of frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/TMAG.2015.2478444","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/20/7410156/07265084.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMAG.2015.2478444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7410156","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Topology Optimization of a Magnetic Resonator Using Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for Wireless Energy Transfer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265084/","displayDocTitle":"Topology Optimization of a Magnetic Resonator Using Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for Wireless Energy Transfer","volume":"52","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","accessionNumber":"15786672","externalId":"7003304","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7265084/","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea","grantNumber":"partially supported/2014-005264"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Topology Optimization of a Magnetic Resonator Using Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method for Wireless Energy Transfer","sourcePdf":"tmag-wang-2478444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057025S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"20","isNumber":"7410156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7410156","articleId":"7265084","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7265088,"authors":[{"name":"Chuang Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/7360993/7265088/7265088-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chuang Ye received the B.S. degree in information engineering in 2009 and the M.S. degree in circuit and system in 2012 from Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA.

Unequal error protection (UEP) of data transmission using hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation (HQAM) is considered in which high priority (HP) data is protected more than low priority (LP) data. In this setting, closed-form bit error rate (BER) expressions for HP data and LP data are derived in Nakagami-m fading channels in the presence of sensing errors. Subsequently, the optimal power control that minimizes weighted sum of average BERs of HP bits and LP bits or its upper bound subject to peak/average transmit power and average interference power constraints is derived and a low-complexity power control algorithm is proposed. Power levels are determined in three different scenarios, depending on the availability of perfect channel side information (CSI) of the transmission and interference links, statistical CSI of both links, or perfect CSI of the transmission link and imperfect CSI of the interference link. The impact of imperfect channel sensing decisions on the error rate performance of cognitive transmissions is also evaluated. In addition, tradeoffs between the number of retransmissions, the severity of fading, and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) quality are analyzed numerically. Moreover, performance comparisons of multimedia transmission with conventional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and HQAM, and the proposed power control strategies are carried out in terms of the received data quality and number of retransmissions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.1,  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"64","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb.1, 2016","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15678263","htmlLink":"/document/7265088/","displayDocTitle":"Multimedia Transmission Over Cognitive Radio Channels Under Sensing Uncertainty","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multimedia Transmission Over Cognitive Radio Channels Under Sensing Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tsp-ye-2478747-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121186S","chronDate":"Feb.1,  2016","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"7360993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7360993","articleId":"7265088","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7265090,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Yong Liu (S\u201911\u2013M\u201915) received the M.S. and B.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Shandong University, Shandong, China, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering (power system direction) from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA, in 2013.","Currently, he is a Research Assistant Professor in the DOE/NSF-cofunded engineering research center CURENT and Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Tennessee.

Most of the current systems rely on an extensive calibration step to achieve high accuracy. We propose SemanticSLAM, a novel unsupervised indoor localization scheme that bypasses the need for war-driving. SemanticSLAM leverages the idea that certain locations in an indoor environment have a unique signature on one or more phone sensors. Climbing stairs, for example, has a distinct pattern on the phone's accelerometer; a specific spot may experience an unusual magnetic interference while another may have a unique set of Wi-Fi access points covering it. SemanticSLAM uses these unique points in the environment as landmarks and combines them with dead-reckoning in a new Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) framework to reduce both the localization error and convergence time. In particular, the phone inertial sensors are used to keep track of the user's path, while the observed landmarks are used to compensate for the accumulation of error in a unified probabilistic framework. Evaluation in two testbeds on Android phones shows that the system can achieve 0.53 meters human median localization errors. In addition, the system can detect the location of landmarks with 0.83 meters median error. This is 62 percent better than a system that does not use SLAM. Moreover, SemanticSLAM has a 33 percent lower convergence time compared to the same systems. This highlights the promise of SemanticSLAM as an unconventional approach for indoor localization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SemanticSLAM: Using Environment Landmarks for Unsupervised Indoor Localization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2478451","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7484375/07265092.pdf","startPage":"1770","endPage":"1782","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2478451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7484375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265092","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265092/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"SemanticSLAM: Using Environment Landmarks for Unsupervised Indoor Localization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"15","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7265092/","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2016","publicationDate":"1 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16070192","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Google Research Award"},{"fundingName":"E-JUST"},{"fundingName":"Egyptian Information Technology Industry Development Agency (ITAC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SemanticSLAM: Using Environment Landmarks for Unsupervised Indoor Localization","sourcePdf":"tmc-youssef-2478451-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158918S","chronDate":"July 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7484375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7484375","articleId":"7265092","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7265095,"authors":[{"name":"Ruonan Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7336577/7265095/7265095-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ruonan Han (S\u201910\u2013M\u201914) received the B.Sc. degree in microelectronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2007, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA, in 2014.","In the summer of 2012, he was an intern with Rambus Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA, designing energy-efficient I/O circuits.

This transmitter consists of a 4 \u00d7 4 array of radiators based on coupled harmonic oscillators. By incorporating a signal filter structure called return-path gap coupler into a differential self-feeding oscillator, the proposed 320 GHz radiator simultaneously maximizes the fundamental oscillation power, harmonic generation, as well as on-chip radiation. To facilitate the TX-RX synchronization of a future terahertz (THz) heterodyne imaging chipset, a fully-integrated phase-locked loop (PLL) is also implemented in the transmitter. Such on-chip phase-locking capability is the first demonstration for all THz radiators in silicon. In the far-field measurement, the total radiated power and EIRP of the chip is 3.3 mW and 22.5 dBm, respectively. The transmitter consumes 610 mW DC power, which leads to a DC-to-THz radiation efficiency of 0.54%.

To improve the weak received signal of vehicular users and to mitigate vehicle penetration loss, researchers have recently proposed the use of moving relays (MRs). People in vehicles can use these MRs that are mounted on top of public transports for better communication. Recent research on MRs, however, is mainly limited to providing performance analysis of vehicular users. The effect of these relays on current heterogeneous cellular networks has yet to be studied. In this paper, we develop a system model for a downlink heterogeneous cellular network, which includes MRs. We derive the coverage probability of macro users, vehicular users, and the overall network. We also show that, in addition to providing better coverage to vehicular users, MRs can also enhance coverage of nonvehicular boundary users with the help of cooperative communication.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2478775","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07265097.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2478775","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","startPage":"6128","endPage":"6135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving Relays in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks\u2014A Coverage Performance Analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Moving Relays in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks\u2014A Coverage Performance Analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265097/","volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7265097/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210045","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving Relays in Heterogeneous Cellular Networks\u2014A Coverage Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tvt-khan-2478775-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05683S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7265097","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7265098,"authors":[{"name":"Weiyang Xu","affiliation":["College of Communication Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Weiyang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085834092"},{"name":"Wei Xiang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering, University of Southern Queensland, Toowoomba, Qld., Australia"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Xiang","id":"37396484300"},{"name":"Maged Elkashlan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, U.K."],"firstName":"Maged","lastName":"Elkashlan","id":"37269057400"},{"name":"Hani Mehrpouyan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boise State University, Boise, ID, USA"],"firstName":"Hani","lastName":"Mehrpouyan","id":"37397432300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7265098","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":468},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the important issue of detecting orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signals in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO). The proposed algorithm utilizes the characteristics of the covariance matrix of the discrete Fourier transform of the input signal to the detector to determine the presence of the primary user's signal. This algorithm can be exploited to differentiate OFDM signals from the noise through the proposal of a new decision metric, which measures the off-diagonal elements of the input signal's covariance matrix. The decision threshold subject to a given probability of false alarm is derived, whereas performance analysis is carried out to demonstrate the potential of the proposed algorithm. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed sensing method in comparison with other existing approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07265098.pdf","startPage":"6798","endPage":"6803","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2478517","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2478517","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265098","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum Sensing of OFDM Signals in the Presence of Carrier Frequency Offset","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Covariance matrices","Detectors","Measurement","Noise","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","discrete Fourier transforms","OFDM modulation","probability","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision threshold","false alarm probability","off-diagonal element measurement","discrete Fourier transform","covariance matrix","CFO","carrier frequency offset","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signal detection","OFDM signal detection","spectrum sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset (CFO)","cognitive radio (CR)","covariance matrix","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","spectrum sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265098/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum Sensing of OFDM Signals in the Presence of Carrier Frequency Offset","volume":"65","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/7265098/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210000","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201177"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum Sensing of OFDM Signals in the Presence of Carrier Frequency Offset","sourcePdf":"tvt-xu-2478517-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053304S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7265098","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7265100,"authors":[{"name":"Shinwon Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7279217/7265100/7265100-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shinwon Kang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2004, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer sciences from the University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, USA, in 2013 and 2014, respectively.","From 2004 to 2007, he was with Xeline, Seoul, Korea, where he was involved with power-line communication.

A spread spectrum clock generation and a clock phase shift technique are introduced for charge pump clock generation in order to suppress EMI noise due to high write throughput of code flash macros, and peak power of EMI noise is reduced by 19 dB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265102/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15685044","htmlLink":"/document/7265102/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 December 2015","volume":"51","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A 28 nm Embedded Split-Gate MONOS (SG-MONOS) Flash Macro for Automotive Achieving 6.4 GB/s Read Throughput by 200 MHz No-Wait Read Operation and 2.0 MB/s Write Throughput at Tj of 170<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^{\\circ}$</tex> </formula>C","openAccessFlag":"T","title":"A 28 nm Embedded Split-Gate MONOS (SG-MONOS) Flash Macro for Automotive Achieving 6.4 GB/s Read Throughput by 200 MHz No-Wait Read Operation and 2.0 MB/s Write Throughput at Tj of 170<formula formulatype=\"inline\"><tex Notation=\"TeX\">$^{\\circ}$</tex> </formula>C","sourcePdf":"jssc-taito-2467186-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057525S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7368951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7368951","articleId":"7265102","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7265103,"authors":[{"name":"Salvatore Levantino","affiliation":["Politecnico di Milano, DEIB, Milano, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7307914/7265103/7265103-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Salvatore Levantino (S\u201999\u2013M\u201902) received the Laurea degree (cum laude) and the Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 1998 and 2001, respectively.","From 2000 to 2002, he was a consultant at Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies, Murray Hill, NJ.

This paper presents the first published multiplying delay-locked loop achieving fine fractional-N frequency resolution, and introduces an automatic cancellation of the phase detector offset. Both capabilities are enabled by insertion of a digital-to-time converter in the reference path. The proposed synthesizer, implemented in a standard 65 nm CMOS process, occupies a core area of 0.09 mm \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, and generates a frequency ranging between 1.6 and 1.9 GHz with a 190 Hz resolution from a 50 MHz quartz-based reference oscillator. In fractional-N mode, the integrated RMS jitter, including random and deterministic components, is below 1.4 ps at 3 mW power consumption, leading to a jitter-power figure of merit of -232 dB. In integer-N mode, the circuit achieves RMS jitter of 0.47 ps at 2.4 mW power and figure of merit of -243 dB. Thanks to the adoption of the automatic offset cancellation, the reference-spur level is reduced from -32 to -55 dBc.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2015.2473667","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/7307914/07265103.pdf","startPage":"2678","endPage":"2691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307914","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2015.2473667","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1.7 GHz Fractional-N Frequency Synthesizer Based on a Multiplying Delay-Locked Loop","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265103","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A 1.7 GHz Fractional-N Frequency Synthesizer Based on a Multiplying Delay-Locked Loop","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265103/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15557946","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7265103/","volume":"50","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.7 GHz Fractional-N Frequency Synthesizer Based on a Multiplying Delay-Locked Loop","sourcePdf":"jssc-levantino-2473667-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.15743S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"7307914","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7307914","articleId":"7265103","onlineDate":"14 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7265104,"authors":[{"name":"Shintaro Izumi","affiliation":["Graduate School of System Informatics, Kobe University, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7337496/7265104/7265104-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shintaro Izumi (S\u201909\u2013M\u201912) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in computer science and systems engineering, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from Kobe University, Hyogo, Japan, in 2007, 2008, and 2011, respectively.","From 2009\u20132011, he was a JSPS Research Fellow at Kobe University.

The novelty of this work is the combination of the non-volatile MCU for normally off computing and a noise-tolerant-QRS (heartbeat) detector to achieve both low-power and noise tolerance. To minimize the stand-by current of MCU, a non-volatile flip-flop and a 6T-4C NVRAM are used. Proposed plate-line charge-share and bit-line non-precharge techniques also contribute to mitigate the active power overhead of 6T-4C NVRAM. The proposed accurate heartbeat detector uses coarse-fine autocorrelation and a template matching technique. Accurate heartbeat detection also contributes system-level power reduction because the active ratio of ADC and digital block can be reduced using heartbeat prediction.

In this architecture, simple modifications are made to the down converter to allow the use of only one analog-to-digital converter. With the proposed signal processing in the baseband, the SFFB DPD can achieve comparative performance as the conventional dual-branch DPD. Experiments were performed using various configurations of LTE/LTE-Advanced (long-term evolution/long-term evolution advanced) signals of up to 80 MHz contiguous bandwidth and carrier spacing of 1 GHz. It is clearly shown by the experimental results that the proposed SFFB DPD can achieve satisfactory linearization performance, with significantly reduced hardware

the shortage of radio-frequency bandwidth in conventional wireless communications. The VLC systems reported in the literature are mainly based on PIN receivers (Rxs). It is highly desirable if these VLC signals can be detected by using built-in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) cameras as Rxs to provide flexible and low-cost wireless communications. However, using the CMOS camera is challenging. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a VLC link using a CMOS mobile phone camera as Rx. By using the rolling shutter effect of the CMOS sensor, the VLC data rate can be significantly enhanced. We first use a second-order polynomial fitting to mitigate the \u201cblooming effect\u201d (saturation of pixels) of the CMOS sensor. In order to extend the VLC transmission distance and mitigate the influence of the background noise, we also propose and demonstrate using histogram equalization and Sobel filter to enhance VLC signal performance. Finally, a third-order polynomial fitting is used to define the threshold. The experimental results show that significant improvement of bit error rate (BER) for about an order of magnitude under different illuminances can be achieved.","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2015.2476757","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics

Different from the conventional modified one-step majority-logic decoding algorithms, we design a turbo-like iterative strategy to recover the performance degradation caused by the simply flipping operation. The main computational loads of the presented algorithm include only binary logic and integer operations, resulting in low decoding complexity. Furthermore, by introducing the iterative set, a very small proportion (less than 6%) of variable nodes are involved in the reliability updating process, which can further reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that, combined with the factor correction technique and a well-designed non-uniform quantization scheme, the presented algorithm can achieve a significant performance improvement and a fast decoding speed, even with very small quantization levels (3-4 bits resolution). The presented algorithm provides a candidate for trade-offs between performance and complexity.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/7265213/07265215.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"345","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2015.000064","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2015.000064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7265213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265215","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative reliability-based modified majority-logic decoding for structured binary LDPC codes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Reliability","Quantization (signal)","Decoding","Iterative algorithms","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative reliability","majority logic decoding","structured binary LDPC codes","majority logic decoding algorithm","low-density parity-check codes","turbo like iterative strategy","integer operations","binary logic","iterative set","computational complexity","factor correction technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Iterative decoding","low-density parity-check (LDPC) code","majority-logic decoding","reliability-based","structured LDPC codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265215/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Iterative reliability-based modified majority-logic decoding for structured binary LDPC codes","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456872","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative reliability-based modified majority-logic decoding for structured binary LDPC codes","sourcePdf":"339.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021657S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","isNumber":"7265213","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7265215","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7265216,"authors":[{"name":"Yangzhao Zhou","affiliation":["Donghua University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Yangzhao","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Xueqin Jiang","affiliation":["Donghua University, Shanghai, CN"],"firstName":"Xueqin","lastName":"Jiang"},{"name":"Moon Ho Lee","affiliation":["Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Jeollabuk-do, KR"],"firstName":"Moon Ho","lastName":"Lee"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"7265216","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Relays","Algorithm design and analysis","Fading","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["matrix algebra","parity check codes","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-compatible LDPC codes","relay communication systems","progressive edge-growth algorithm","low-density parity-check codes","parity-check matrix","modified PEG algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","progressive edge-growth (PEG) algorithm","relay"]}],"abstract":"It is known that the progressive edge-growth (PEG) algorithm can be used to construct low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes at finite code lengths with large girths through the establishment of edges between variable and check nodes in an edge-by-edge manner.

It behaves as follows: First, a conventional LDPC decoding is applied to received LDPC codewords one by one. Then, we count the number of word errors in a predetermined number of decoded codewords. If there is no word error, nothing needs to be done and we can move to the next group of codewords with no delay. Otherwise, we perform a proper post-processing which pro-ducesa new soft-valued codeword (this will befully explained in the main body of this paper) and then apply the conventional LDPC decoding to it again to recover the unsuccessfully decoded codewords. For the proposed decoding scheme, we adopt a simple product code structure which contains LDPC codes and simple algebraic codes as its horizontal and vertical codes, respectively. The decoding capability of the proposed decoding scheme is defined and analyzed using the parity-check matrices of vertical codes and, especially, the combined-decodability is derived for the case of single parity-check (SPC) codes and Hamming codes used as vertical codes. It is also shown that the proposed decoding scheme achieves much better error correcting capability in high SNR region with little additional decoding complexity, compared with the conventional LDPC decoding scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265217/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15456869","volume":"17","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"New decoding scheme for LDPC codes based on simple product code structure","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New decoding scheme for LDPC codes based on simple product code structure","sourcePdf":"351.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03062S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","isNumber":"7265213","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","articleId":"7265217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":7265221,"authors":[{"name":"Shiyin Li","affiliation":["China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Shiyin","lastName":"Li"},{"name":"Shuyan Xiao","affiliation":["China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Shuyan","lastName":"Xiao"},{"name":"Maomao Zhang","affiliation":["China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Maomao","lastName":"Zhang"},{"name":"Xiaoguang Zhang","affiliation":["China University of Mining and Technology, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, CN"],"firstName":"Xiaoguang","lastName":"Zhang"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"7265221","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":440},"abstract":"This paper considers a wideband cognitive radio network which can simultaneously sense multiple narrowband channels and thus aggregate the detected available channels for transmission and proposes a novel cognitive radio system that exhibits improved sensing throughput and can save power consumption of secondary user (SU) compared to the conventional cognitive radio system studied so far.

In our analysis, besides the average interference power constraint at primary user, the average transmit power constraint of SU is also considered for the two schemes and then a subgradient algorithm is developed to obtain the optimal sensing time and the corresponding power allocation strategy. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to verify the performance of the two proposed schemes.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/7265213/07265221.pdf","startPage":"394","endPage":"405","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2015.000070","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2015.000070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7265213","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power saving and improving the throughput of spectrum sharing in wideband cognitive radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Throughput","Wideband","Interference","Cognitive radio","Receivers","Narrowband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power saving","wideband cognitive radio networks","multiple narrowband channels","novel cognitive radio system","secondary user","SU","optimal sensing time","power allocation strategy","wideband opportunistic spectrum access scheme","wideband sensing-based spectrum sharing scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio (CR)","power saving","spectrum sharing","throughput maximization","wideband spectrum sensing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Power saving and improving the throughput of spectrum sharing in wideband cognitive radio networks","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456866","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power saving and improving the throughput of spectrum sharing in wideband cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"394.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04056S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","isNumber":"7265213","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7265221","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7265222,"authors":[{"name":"Asad Ali","affiliation":["National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, PK"],"firstName":"Asad","lastName":"Ali"},{"name":"Junaid Qadir","affiliation":["National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, PK"],"firstName":"Junaid","lastName":"Qadir"},{"name":"Adeel Baig","affiliation":["National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad, PK"],"firstName":"Adeel","lastName":"Baig"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1229-2370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1976-5541"}],"articleNumber":"7265222","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":257},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Routing","Multicast communication","Delays","Switches","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","learning (artificial intelligence)","learning automata","multi-access systems","multicast communication","radio spectrum management","radiofrequency interference","routing protocols","telecommunication switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning automata","cognitive radio networks","CRN multicasting protocol","artificial radio spectrum scarcity","dynamic spectrum access","secondary network","secondary users","primary network","licensed primary users","licensed spectrum","channel switching","multipath on-demand multicast routing protocol","unicast routing","reinforcement learning"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio network (CRN)","multicasting","multi-path","routing"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have emerged as a promising solution to the problem of spectrum under utilization and artificial radio spectrum scarcity. The paradigm of dynamic spectrum access allows a secondary network comprising of secondary users (SUs) to coexist with a primary network comprising of licensed primary users (PUs) subject to the condition that SUs do not cause any interference to the primary network. Since it is necessary for SUs to avoid any interference to the primary network, PU activity precludes attempts of SUs to access the licensed spectrum and forces frequent channel switching for SUs. This dynamic nature of CRNs, coupled with the possibility that an SU may not share a common channel with all its neighbors, makes the task of multicast routing especially challenging. In this work, we have proposed a novel multipath on-demand multicast routing protocol for CRNs. The approach of multipath routing, although commonly used in unicast routing, has not been explored for multicasting earlier. Motivated by the fact that CRNs have highly dynamic conditions, whose parameters are often unknown, the multicast routing problem is modeled in the reinforcement learning based framework of learning automata. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach of multipath multicasting is feasible, with our proposed protocol showing a superior performance to a baseline state-of-the-art CRN multicasting protocol.","doi":"10.1109/JCN.2015.000071","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/5449605/7265213/07265222.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7265213","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JCN.2015.000071","publicationTitle":"Journal of Communications and Networks","startPage":"406","endPage":"418","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning automata based multipath multicasting in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7265222","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"KICS","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Learning automata based multipath multicasting in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7265222/","volume":"17","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456871","dateOfInsertion":"14 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning automata based multipath multicasting in cognitive radio networks","sourcePdf":"406.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0328S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","isNumber":"7265213","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5449605","citationCount":"4","articleId":"7265222","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"KICS","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266238,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth Salem","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J. 0B544"],"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Salem"},{"name":"Hector Garcia-Molina","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, N.J. 0B544"],"firstName":"Hector","lastName":"Garcia-Molina"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-8186-0655-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7266238","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Disk drives","Magnetic heads","Data models","Data transfer","Operating systems","Program processors"]}],"abstract":"Just like parallel processing elements can substantially speed up computationally intensive tasks, concurrent transfer of data in and out of memory can speed up data intensive tasks.

Recently, the condition monitoring of capacitors to estimate their health status have been attracted by the academic research. Industry applications require more reliable power electronics products with preventive maintenances. However, the existing capacitor condition monitoring methods suffer from either increased hardware cost or low estimation accuracy, being the challenges to be adopted in industry applications. New development in condition monitoring technology with software solutions without extra hardware will reduce the cost, and therefore could be more promising for industry applications. A condition monitoring method based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm is therefore proposed in this paper. The implementation of the ANN to the DC-link capacitor condition monitoring in a back-to-back converter is presented. The error analysis of the capacitance estimation is also given. The presented method enables a pure software based approach with high parameter estimation accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/PowerEng.2015.7266382","pdfPath":"/iel7/7222826/7266285/07266382.pdf","startPage":"587","endPage":"591","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives (POWERENG)","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 5th International Conference on Power Engineering, Energy and Electrical Drives (POWERENG)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PowerEng.2015.7266382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266285","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Condition monitoring for DC-link capacitors based on artificial neural network algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266382/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Condition monitoring for DC-link capacitors based on artificial neural network algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15475721","publicationDate":"May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7266382/","conferenceDate":"11-13 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Condition monitoring for DC-link capacitors based on artificial neural network algorithm","confLoc":"Riga, Latvia","sourcePdf":"102PID3759975.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055634S","chronDate":"11-13 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7222826","isNumber":"7266285","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7222826","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7266285","articleId":"7266382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7266406,"authors":[{"name":"Bwo-Ren Ke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Bwo-Ren","lastName":"Ke","id":"37428823300"},{"name":"Te-Tien Ku","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Te-Tien","lastName":"Ku","id":"37287638400"},{"name":"Yu-Lung Ke","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Yu-Lung","lastName":"Ke","id":"37275822700"},{"name":"Chen-Yuan Chuang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Chen-Yuan","lastName":"Chuang","id":"37085658097"},{"name":"Hong-Zhang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Penghu University of Science and Technology, Taiwan, R.O.C."],"firstName":"Hong-Zhang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085658249"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8063-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8062-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-4893"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-4907"}],"articleNumber":"7266406","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"abstract":"In this paper, the charge and discharge strategies were conducted for a future battery energy storage system (BESS) at the National Penghu University of Science and Technology.

A probabilistic neural network model was used to predict the daily load and photovoltaic (PV) generation curve for controlling the charge-discharge of the BESS. This study considered both the actual and predicted values of PV generation systems as well as the daily charge-discharge control of the BESS used to balance the peak and off-peak electricity consumption to shave peak loads under the two- and three-phase electricity-pricing methods. The average monthly electric bill and contract capacity were calculated, and the effects of different BESS capacities from the load curve were observed. The results were used to evaluate and determine the capacity required by the BESS. The prediction errors for the load and PV generation of the year were 6.22% and 7.14%, respectively. The electric bills and contract capacities of the actual and predicted values were compared, and the resulting difference was low; this implies that the proposed prediction method is practicable.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Buildings","Education","Contracts","Companies","Batteries","Libraries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["battery storage plants","load forecasting","neural nets","photovoltaic power systems","pricing","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discharge strategies","battery energy storage system","BESS","National Penghu University of Science and Technology","OpenDSS software","power distribution system","probabilistic neural network model","photovoltaic generation curve","PV generation systems","daily charge-discharge control","off-peak electricity consumption","peak loads","two-phase electricity-pricing methods","three-phase electricity-pricing methods","average monthly electric bill","contract capacity","load curve","university campus","load prediction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BESS Capacity","Power Load","PV Generation","Prediction","OpenDSS"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICPS.2015.7266406","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/IAS 51st Industrial & Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference (I&CPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/IAS 51st Industrial & Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference (I&CPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7228133/7266399/07266406.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266399","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPS.2015.7266406","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sizing the battery energy storage system on a university campus with prediction of load and photovoltaic generation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266406","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sizing the battery energy storage system on a university campus with prediction of load and photovoltaic generation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266406/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7266406/","accessionNumber":"15486317","conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sizing the battery energy storage system on a university campus with prediction of load and photovoltaic generation","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"2015ESC0057.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057127S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7228133","isNumber":"7266399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7228133","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7266399","articleId":"7266406","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7266412,"authors":[{"name":"Fernando J.

However, besides the motor energy efficiency, there are other important operation issues in the scope of the modern industrials plants which also have to be taken into account when deciding for a high-efficiency motor, such as motor reliability, protection, maintenance, reactive power, operating speed, starting torque, and torque-speed capability. In this paper, key considerations on the reliability and operation of high-efficiency motors are presented, offering a comprehensive perspective on the advantages, drawbacks and limitations of high-efficiency industrial motors. A comparison of the lifetime expectancy of IE2-, IE3- and IE4-Class motors under unbalanced and distorted voltage supply is presented. It is also demonstrated how moving to a higher efficiency class can avoid investing in a larger motor. As far as the authors know, this is the first time this analysis on different classes of very high-efficiency motors is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ICPS.2015.7266412","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/IAS 51st Industrial & Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference (I&CPS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/IAS 51st Industrial & Commercial Power Systems Technical Conference (I&CPS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7228133/7266399/07266412.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICPS.2015.7266412","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266399","startPage":"1","endPage":"13","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability and operation of high-efficiency induction motors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266412","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Reliability and operation of high-efficiency induction motors","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266412/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-8 May 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15486289","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7266412/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability and operation of high-efficiency induction motors","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"2015PSEC0008.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.161895S","chronDate":"5-8 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7228133","isNumber":"7266399","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7228133","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7266399","articleId":"7266412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266428,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaodong Liang","affiliation":["Washington State University Electrical Engineering, School of Engineering and Computer Science, Vancouver, WA, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7228133/7266399/7266428/7266428-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaodong Liang (M'06-SM'09) was born in Lingyuan, China.

On the basis of the bit-error-ratio (BER) bounds, joint power and rate adaptive QAM with network coding scheme is proposed for the purpose of improving the throughput of the relaying system. In addition, Network-coded-aided QAM suffers a modest SNR loss due to the direct current (DC) bias, which will be derived in detail in this paper.

Due to the connectivity of physical objects with the untrusted Internet, security has become an important pillar for the success of IoT-based services. Things in the IoT are resource-constrained devices with limited processing and storage capabilities. Often, these things are battery powered and connected through lossy wireless links. Therefore, lightweight and efficient ways of providing secure communication in the IoT are needed. In this context, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is considered as a strong candidate to provide security in the IoT while being able to function in constrained environments. In this paper we present a lightweight implementation and evaluation of ECC for the Contiki OS. For fast, secure and cost-effective mass development of IoT-based services by different vendors, it is important that the IoT protocols are implemented and released as open source and open licensed. To the best of our knowledge our ECC is the first lightweight BSD-licensed ECC for the IoT devices. We show the feasibility of our implementation by a thorough performance analysis using several implementations and optimization algorithms. Moreover, we evaluate it on a real IoT hardware platform.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266475/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7266475/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15475661","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"BSD-based elliptic curve cryptography for the open Internet of Things","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BSD-based elliptic curve cryptography for the open Internet of Things","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"pid1162728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077431S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210292","isNumber":"7266450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210292","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"7266450","articleId":"7266475","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266488,"authors":[{"name":"Medhat H.

However, femtocell networks have many challenges. One of the major challenges of femtocell networks is the interference management problem, where deployment of femtocells in the range of macro-cells may degrade the performance of the macrocell. In this paper, we develop a new platform for studying interference management in distributed femtocell networks using reinforcement learning approach. We design a complete MAC protocol to perform distributed power allocation using Q-Learning algorithm, where both independent and cooperative learning approaches are applied across network nodes. The objective of the Q-Learning algorithms is to maximize aggregate femtocells capacity, while maintaining the QoS for the Macrocell users. Furthermore, we present the realization of the algorithms using GNURadio and USRP platforms. Performance evaluation are conducted in terms of macrocell capacity convergence to a target capacity and improvement of aggregate femtocells capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 7th

the machine-type communications (MTC) poses some serious challenges due to the large performance mismatch between the regular LTE user equipment and the MTC device, caused mainly by the physical limitations of MTC devices. This paper addresses these limitations and their implications to the communication signal's link performance and the corresponding link budget. The focus of this paper is on the downlink control channel design. We analyze the issues of the existing LTE control channels and propose an enhanced design specifically-tailored to overcome the limitations of MTC devices and the stringent link budget by applying repeated transmissions, frequency retuning, and the orthogonal spatial precoding based joint channel estimation, fully exploiting the time, frequency, as well as spatial diversities. The basic schemes proposed in this paper apply to other LTE channels as well, such as the uplink control channel, and the random access channel.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266450","publicationTitle":"2015 7th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 7th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210292/7266450/07266491.pdf","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced LTE physical downlink control channel design for machine-type communications","doi":"10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266491","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced LTE physical downlink control channel design for machine-type communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266491/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15475684","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7266491/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced LTE physical downlink control channel design for machine-type communications","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"pid1162208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037901S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210292","isNumber":"7266450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210292","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7266450","articleId":"7266491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266508,"authors":[{"name":"Fatna Belqasmi","affiliation":["College of Technological Innovation, Zayed University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"Fatna","lastName":"Belqasmi","id":"37297195500"},{"name":"May El Barachi","affiliation":["College of Technological Innovation, Zayed University, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates"],"firstName":"May","lastName":"El Barachi","id":"37396556100"},{"name":"Jose M.

Cloud computing is an emerging networking paradigm with several inherent advantages including easy introduction of new services, efficient resource use, scalability, and pay-per-use. Cloud computing is ubiquitous in the Internet domain, but its use in the telecommunications context is still in its infancy. Offering next generation networks as cloud computing services will facilitate their deployment and enable deployment and management cost sharing. We envision that many network operators and service providers will soon support this sharing idea, as demonstrated by a number of ongoing agreements and investigation initiatives (e.g. between Rogers and Videotron in Canada, and between Etisalat and DU in the UAE). However, many issues need to be solved before this vision becomes a reality. This position paper presents our vision for offering next generation networks as cloud services, sketches an early business model, identifies the research issues, and presents a roadmap.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NGNaaS: NGNs as cloud computing services","publicationTitle":"2015 7th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)","doi":"10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266508","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 7th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210292/7266450/07266508.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266508","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266450","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266508","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266508/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"NGNaaS: NGNs as cloud computing services","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7266508/","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15475671","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NGNaaS: NGNs as cloud computing services","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"pid1162556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07524S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210292","isNumber":"7266450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210292","xplore-issue":"7266450","articleId":"7266508","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266510,"authors":[{"name":"Mikhail Zolotukhin","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Mikhail","lastName":"Zolotukhin","id":"38230388000"},{"name":"Timo H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","affiliation":["Department of Mathematical Information Technology, University of Jyvaskyla, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Timo","lastName":"H\u00e4m\u00e4l\u00e4inen","id":"37269442700"},{"name":"Tero Kokkonen","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, JAMK University of Applied Sciences, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Tero","lastName":"Kokkonen","id":"37085465549"},{"name":"Jarmo Siltanen","affiliation":["Institute of Information Technology, JAMK University of Applied Sciences, Jyvaskyla, Finland"],"firstName":"Jarmo","lastName":"Siltanen","id":"37424121800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8784-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8783-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4952"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4960"}],"articleNumber":"7266510","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clustering algorithms","Intrusion detection","Accuracy","Feature extraction","IP networks","Training","Histograms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection approach","RGCE","realistic cyber environment","packet headers","zero-day intrusions","normal user behavior","traffic flows","soft clustering","anomalous network flows","online detection"]}],"abstract":"In this study, we apply an anomaly-based approach to analyze traffic flows transferred over a network to detect the flows related to different types of attacks. Based on the information extracted from network flows a model of normal user behavior is discovered with the help of several clustering techniques. This model is then used to detect anomalies within recent time intervals. Since this approach is based on normal user behavior, it can potentially detect zero-day intrusions. Moreover, such a flow-based intrusion detection approach can be used in high speeds since it is based on information in packet headers, and, therefore, has to handle a considerably lesser amount of data. The proposed framework is tested on the data obtained with the help of a realistic cyber environment (RGCE) that enables one to construct real attack vectors. The simulations show that the proposed method results in a higher accuracy rate when compared to other intrusion detection techniques.","doi":"10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266510","publicationTitle":"2015 7th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 7th International Conference on New Technologies, Mobility and Security (NTMS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7210292/7266450/07266510.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NTMS.2015.7266510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266450","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Online detection of anomalous network flows with soft clustering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266510/","displayDocTitle":"Online detection of anomalous network flows with soft clustering","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15486213","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7266510/","conferenceDate":"27-29 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"24 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online detection of anomalous network flows with soft clustering","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"pid1162352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060668S","chronDate":"27-29 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7210292","isNumber":"7266450","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7210292","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7266450","articleId":"7266510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266528,"authors":[{"name":"Ijaz Ahmad","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Universitv of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Ijaz","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37085508818"},{"name":"Suneth Namal","affiliation":["Oulun Yliopisto, Oulu, FI"],"firstName":"Suneth","lastName":"Namal","id":"37832584700"},{"name":"Mika Ylianttila","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Universitv of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Mika","lastName":"Ylianttila","id":"37298828400"},{"name":"Andrei Gurtov","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications, Universitv of Oulu, Finland"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Gurtov","id":"37320552400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8784-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8783-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-4952"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-4960"}],"articleNumber":"7266528","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":402},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266528","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Engines","Quality of service","Resource management","Cognition","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","software defined networking","telecommunication equipment","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software defined cognitive networking","autonomic network management","network architecture","programmatic control","networking equipment","logically centralized servers","SDN","SDCoN"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive networking has the potential to enable autonomic network management by empowering the network components to automatically adjust to the changing network environment.

Thence there is a means (described in earlier work) to detect it via the novel Bernoulli filter paradigm that is emerging as an integrated tracker/track-management tool. This paper details additional progress made to model the detectability of a hidden Markov model (HMM) that is observed in the presence of false measurements or clutter. The ultimate goal of this analysis is to be able to make statements regarding the minimum complexity that an HMM would need to involve in order that it be detectable with reasonable fidelity, as well as upper bounds on the level of clutter (expected number of false measurements) and probability of miss of a relevant observation. Put simply, if a threat modeled as an HMM has (say) three components - transaction O1, followed by O2 and then O3 with modeled delays in between - then this would only be detectable if the delays were very small or if there were very little clutter. A more feasible situation would involve 20 or 30 transactions. To characterize this more fully is the goal of this manuscript.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Approximation methods","Clutter","Silicon","Terrorism","Weapons","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["detectability analysis","structured action detection","structured action estimation","cluttered data","HMM","Bernoulli filter paradigm","integrated tracker tool","integrated track-management tool","hidden Markov model"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266535","startPage":"173","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229502/7266535/07266559.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detectability analysis of detection and estimation of structured action from cluttered data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detectability analysis of detection and estimation of structured action from cluttered data","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15457602","publicationDate":"July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7266559/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detectability analysis of detection and estimation of structured action from cluttered data","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"0241570110861.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076335S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229502","isNumber":"7266535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229502","xplore-issue":"7266535","articleId":"7266559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIF","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266660,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Beard","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Bentley, WA, Australia","Maritime Division, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Rockingham, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Beard","id":"37839711900"},{"name":"Ba-Tuong Vo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Bentley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Ba-Tuong","lastName":"Vo","id":"37289281300"},{"name":"Ba-Ngu Vo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Bentley, WA, Australia"],"firstName":"Ba-Ngu","lastName":"Vo","id":"37274760500"},{"name":"Sanjeev Arulampalam","affiliation":["Maritime Division, Defence Science and Technology Organisation, Edinburgh, SA, Australia"],"firstName":"Sanjeev","lastName":"Arulampalam","id":"38559664100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9824-4386-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9824-4387-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7266660","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":389},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Target tracking","Density measurement","Approximation algorithms","Estimation error","Closed-form solutions","Trajectory","Probability density function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory","object tracking","optimal control","stochastic systems","target tracking","trajectory control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal stochastic sensor control","Cauchy-Schwarz divergence","multiobject tracking scenarios","information theoretic divergence measure","labelled random finite set densities","generalised labelled multi-Bernoulli densities","GLMB densities","tractable objective function","trajectory optimisation","bearings-only multitarget tracking"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-target sensor control","information theoretic control","generalised labelled multi-Bernoulli","Cauchy-Schwarz divergence","bearings-only trajectory optimisation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266535","publicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229502/7266535/07266660.pdf","startPage":"937","endPage":"944","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor control for multi-target tracking using Cauchy-Schwarz divergence","abstract":"In this paper, we propose a method for optimal stochastic sensor control, where the goal is to minimise the estimation error in multi-object tracking scenarios. Our approach is based on an information theoretic divergence measure between labelled random finite set densities. The multi-target posteriors are generalised labelled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) densities, which do not permit closed form solutions for traditional information divergence measures such as Kullback-Leibler or R\u00e9nyi. However, we demonstrate that the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence admits a closed form solution for GLMB densities, thus it can be used as a tractable objective function for multi-target sensor control. This is demonstrated with an application to sensor trajectory optimisation for bearings-only multi-target tracking.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266660/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7266660/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15457629","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Sensor control for multi-target tracking using Cauchy-Schwarz divergence","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor control for multi-target tracking using Cauchy-Schwarz divergence","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"1251570111625.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085351S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229502","isNumber":"7266535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229502","xplore-issue":"7266535","articleId":"7266660","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIF","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7266664,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Hawes","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Hawes","id":"38232584400"},{"name":"Lyudmila Mihaylova","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, University of Sheffield, UK"],"firstName":"Lyudmila","lastName":"Mihaylova","id":"37284641500"},{"name":"Francois Septier","affiliation":["CRIStAL UMR CNRS 9189, Institute Mines Telecom/Telecom Lille, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Septier","id":"37294495200"},{"name":"Simon Godsill","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, Cambridge University, UK"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Godsill","id":"37270714200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-9824-4386-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-0-9824-4387-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7266664","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Direction-of-arrival estimation","Arrays","Estimation","Bayes methods","Kalman filters","Compressed sensing","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","Bayes methods","compressed sensing","computational complexity","Gaussian distribution","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction of arrival estimation","dynamic direction of arrival","narrowband signal impinging","sensor array","Bayesian compressive sensing framework","BCS","Bayesian compressed sensing Kalman filter","BCSKF","nonzero valued signal present","DOA","angular region","Gaussian distribution","expected sparse received signals","computational complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DOA estimation","Bayesian compressed sensing","Kalman filter","dynamic DOA","DOA tracking"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we look to address the problem of estimating the dynamic direction of arrival (DOA) of a narrowband signal impinging on a sensor array from the far field. The initial estimate is made using a Bayesian compressive sensing (BCS) framework and then tracked using a Bayesian compressed sensing Kalman filter (BCSKF). The BCS framework splits the angular region into N potential DOAs and enforces a belief that only a few of the DOAs will have a non-zero valued signal present. A BCSKF can then be used to track the change in the DOA using the same framework. There can be an issue when the DOA approaches the endfire of the array. In this angular region current methods can struggle to accurately estimate and track changes in the DOAs. To tackle this problem, we propose changing the traditional sparse belief associated with BCS to a belief that the estimated signals will match the predicted signals given a known DOA change. This is done by modelling the difference between the expected sparse received signals and the estimated sparse received signals as a Gaussian distribution. Example test scenarios are provided and comparisons made with the traditional BCS based estimation method. They show that an improvement in estimation accuracy is possible without a significant increase in computational complexity.","publicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229502/7266535/07266664.pdf","startPage":"969","endPage":"975","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian compressed sensing Kalman filter for direction of arrival estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266664/","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian compressed sensing Kalman filter for direction of arrival estimation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15457619","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7266664/","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian compressed sensing Kalman filter for direction of arrival estimation","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"1291570102661.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056861S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229502","isNumber":"7266535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229502","xplore-issue":"7266535","articleId":"7266664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIF","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266708,"authors":[{"name":"W.

If object classes not present in the training dataset are detected during testing, they can be mis-classified as one of the training classes. This increases overall false alarm rate and affects operator reliability and trust in the detection algorithm. Previous work showed that classification algorithms are often overconfident in their predictions and hence cannot reliably flag image regions about which the algorithm is uncertain or which need further sampling or processing. This paper describes object detectors based on SVMs and Gaussian Processes for SAS imagery, followed by probabilistic calibration of detector confidence scores. The entropy or uncertainty of these scores is then used to identify low-confidence regions and indicate the presence of previously unseen or anomalous objects.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Identifying anomalous objects in SAS imagery using uncertainty","publicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 18th International Conference on Information Fusion (Fusion)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7229502/7266535/07266722.pdf","startPage":"1410","endPage":"1416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266722","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266722/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Identifying anomalous objects in SAS imagery using uncertainty","conferenceDate":"6-9 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7266722/","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15457625","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying anomalous objects in SAS imagery using uncertainty","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"1871570111433.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054095S","chronDate":"6-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7229502","isNumber":"7266535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7229502","xplore-issue":"7266535","articleId":"7266722","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ISIF","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266724,"authors":[{"name":"Marc Ren\u00e9 Zofka","affiliation":["Department of Technical Cognitive Assistance Systems, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Marc Ren\u00e9","lastName":"Zofka","id":"37085673044"},{"name":"Florian Kuhnt","affiliation":["Department of Technical Cognitive Assistance Systems, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Kuhnt","id":"37085365875"},{"name":"Ralf Kohlhaas","affiliation":["Department of Technical Cognitive Assistance Systems, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Ralf","lastName":"Kohlhaas","id":"38557612000"},{"name":"Christoph Rist","affiliation":["Department of Technical Cognitive Assistance Systems, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Rist","id":"37085762644"},{"name":"Thomas Schamm","affiliation":["Department of Technical Cognitive Assistance Systems, FZI Research Center for Information Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Schamm","id":"37541789600"},{"name":"J.

Additionally, new malware strains appear at a higher rate than ever before. Since many of these malware evade existing security products, traditional defenses deployed by enterprises today often fail at detecting infections at an early stage. We address the problem of detecting early-stage APT infection by proposing a new framework based on belief propagation inspired from graph theory. We demonstrate that our techniques perform well on two large datasets. We achieve high accuracy on two months of DNS logs released by Los Alamos National Lab (LANL), which include APT infection attacks simulated by LANL domain experts. We also apply our algorithms to 38TB of web proxy logs collected at the border of a large enterprise and identify hundreds of malicious domains overlooked by state-of-the-art security products.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Early-Stage Enterprise Infection by Mining Large-Scale Log Data","publicationTitle":"2015 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on

Address Space Randomization","abstract":"We present a micro-architecture based lightweight framework to enhance dependability and security of software against code reuse attack. Different from the prior hardware based approaches for mitigating code reuse attacks, our solution is based on software diversity and instruction level control flow randomization. Generally, software based instruction location randomization (ILR) using binary emulator as a mediation layer has been shown to be effective for thwarting code reuse attacks like return oriented programming (ROP). However, our in-depth studies show that straightforward and naive implementation of ILR at the micro-architecture level will incur major performance deficiencies in terms of instruction fetch and cache utilization. For example, straightforward implementation of ILR increases the first level instruction cache miss rates on average by more than 9 times for a set of SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks. To address these issues, we present a novel micro-architecture design that can support native execution of control flow randomized software binary while at the same time preserve the performance of instruction fetch and efficient use of on-chip caches. The proposed design is evaluated by extending cycle based x86 architecture simulator, XIOSim with validated power simulation. Performance evaluation on SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks shows an average speedup of 1.63 times compared to the hardware implementation of ILR. Using the proposed approach, direct execution of ILR software incurs only 2.1% IPC performance slowdown with a very small hardware overhead.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266855/","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15473382","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7266855/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Enhancing Software Dependability and Security with Hardware Supported Instruction Address Space Randomization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhancing Software Dependability and Security with Hardware Supported Instruction Address Space Randomization","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"8629a251.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150511S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7265894","isNumber":"7266818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7265894","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7266818","articleId":"7266855","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7266864,"authors":[{"name":"Chiachen Chou","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Altanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Chiachen","lastName":"Chou","id":"37061099700"},{"name":"Prashant Nair","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Altanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Prashant","lastName":"Nair","id":"37061113300"},{"name":"Moinuddin K.

Refresh operations for main memory account for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption, especially during idle periods, when processor can be switched off quickly, however, memory contents continue to get refreshed to avoid data loss. Given that mobile devices are idle most of the times, reducing refresh power in idle mode is critical to maximize the duration for which the device remains usable. The frequency of refresh operations in memory can be reduced significantly by using strong multi-bit error correction codes (ECC). Unfortunately, strong ECC codes incur high latency, which causes significant performance degradation (as high as 21%, and on average 10%). To obtain both low refresh power in idle periods and high performance in active periods, this paper proposes Morphable ECC (MECC). During idle periods, MECC keeps the memory protected with 6-bit ECC (ECC-6) and employs a refresh period of 1 second, instead of the typical refresh period of 64ms. During active operation, MECC reduces the refresh interval to 64ms, and converts memory from ECC-6 to weaker ECC (single-bit error correction) on a demand-basis, thus avoiding the high latency of ECC-6, except for the first access during the active mode. Our proposal reduces refresh operations during idle mode by 16x, memory power in idle mode by 2X, while retaining performance within 2% of a system that does not use any ECC.","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2015.33","publicationTitle":"2015 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7265894/7266818/07266864.pdf","startPage":"355","endPage":"366","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2015.33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Refresh Power in Mobile Devices with Morphable ECC","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266864/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Refresh Power in Mobile Devices with Morphable ECC","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15473369","htmlLink":"/document/7266864/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Refresh Power in Mobile Devices with Morphable ECC","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"8629a355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062778S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7265894","isNumber":"7266818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7265894","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7266818","articleId":"7266864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266868,"authors":[{"name":"Babak Rahbarinia","affiliation":["University of Georgia"],"firstName":"Babak","lastName":"Rahbarinia","id":"37395715400"},{"name":"Roberto Perdisci","firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Perdisci","id":"37659865800"},{"name":"Manos Antonakakis","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Manos","lastName":"Antonakakis","id":"38110858000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8629-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-8628-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1530-0889"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-3927"}],"articleNumber":"7266868","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":56,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":734},"abstract":"In this paper, we propose Segugio, a novel defense system that allows for efficiently tracking the occurrence of new malware-control domain names in very large ISP networks.

As prior works have shown, failures in DRAM devices are an important source of errors in modern servers. To reduce the effects of memory errors, error correcting codes (ECC) have been developed to help detect and correct errors when they occur. In order to develop effective techniques, including new ECC mechanisms, to combat memory errors, it is important to understand the memory reliability trends in modern systems. In this paper, we analyze the memory errors in the entire fleet of servers at Facebook over the course of fourteen months, representing billions of device days. The systems we examine cover a wide range of devices commonly used in modern servers, with DIMMs manufactured by 4 vendors in capacities ranging from 2 GB to 24 GB that use the modern DDR3 communication protocol. We observe several new reliability trends for memory systems that have not been discussed before in literature. We show that (1) memory errors follow a power-law, specifically, a Pareto distribution with decreasing hazard rate, with average error rate exceeding median error rate by around 55\u00d7, (2) non-DRAM memory failures from the memory controller and memory channel cause the majority of errors, and the hardware and software overheads to handle such errors cause a kind of denial of service attack in some servers, (3) using our detailed analysis, we provide the first evidence that more recent DRAM cell fabrication technologies (as indicated by chip density) have substantially higher failure rates, increasing by 1.8\u00d7 over the previous generation, (4) DIMM architecture decisions affect memory reliability: DIMMs with fewer chips and lower transfer widths have the lowest error rates, likely due to electrical noise reduction, (5) while CPU and memory utilization do not show clear trends with respect to failure rates, workload type can influence failure rate by up to 6:5\u00d7, suggesting certain memory access patterns may induce more errors, (6) we develop a model for memory reliability and show how system design choices such as using lower density DIMMs and fewer cores per chip can reduce failure rates of a baseline server by up to 57.7%, and (7) we perform the first implementation and real-system analysis of page offlining at scale, showing that it can reduce memory error rate by 67%, and identify several real-world impediments to the technique.","doi":"10.1109/DSN.2015.57","publicationTitle":"2015 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 45th Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/7265894/7266818/07266869.pdf","startPage":"415","endPage":"426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSN.2015.57","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266818","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Revisiting Memory Errors in Large-Scale Production Data Centers: Analysis and Modeling of New Trends from the Field","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266869/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-25 June 2015","displayDocTitle":"Revisiting Memory Errors in Large-Scale Production Data Centers: Analysis and Modeling of New Trends from the Field","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15473379","htmlLink":"/document/7266869/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","conferenceDate":"22-25 June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Revisiting Memory Errors in Large-Scale Production Data Centers: Analysis and Modeling of New Trends from the Field","confLoc":"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","sourcePdf":"8629a415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072744S","chronDate":"22-25 June 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7265894","isNumber":"7266818","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7265894","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7266818","articleId":"7266869","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266870,"authors":[{"name":"Moinuddin K.

A key contributor to this reduced reliability is read disturb, where a read to one row of cells impacts the threshold voltages of unread flash cells in different rows of the same block. Such disturbances may shift the threshold voltages of these unread cells to different logical states than originally programmed, leading to read errors that hurt endurance. For the first time in open literature, this paper experimentally characterizes read disturb errors on state-of-the-art 2Y-nm (i.e., 20-24 nm) MLC NAND flash memory chips. Our findings (1) correlate the magnitude of threshold voltage shifts with read operation counts, (2) demonstrate how program/erase cycle count and retention age affect the read-disturb-induced error rate, and (3) identify that lowering pass-through voltage levels reduces the impact of read disturb and extend flash lifetime. Particularly, we find that the probability of read disturb errors increases with both higher wear-out and higher pass-through voltage levels. We leverage these findings to develop two new techniques. The first technique mitigates read disturb errors by dynamically tuning the pass-through voltage on a per-block basis.

The adopted strategy was to adapt the energy consumption of the system by controlling the toggle rate of its signals according to the energy prediction and the performance levels set by the system designer. The architecture model was designed in a Cyclone IV FPGA and its main advantages are: it may be used within a wide range of applications, since it has been modelled to control synchronous systems, it causes a little impact on the project design, as to couple the harvesting-aware subsystem with the application modules does not imply changes in the application source code. In the case study presented, an RGB-YCbCr converter was used as an application in order to validate the implementation data, simulation and results presented in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7264388/7266915/07266954.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"154","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Autonomic Computing","doi":"10.1109/ICAC.2015.19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAC.2015.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7266915","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7266954","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Architecture Model for Harvesting-Aware Applications in FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Batteries","Cyclones","Energy harvesting","Solar energy","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy consumption","field programmable gate arrays","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["harvesting-aware application","field programmable gate array","design complexity","energy prediction","Cyclone IV FPGA","harvesting-aware subsystem","power-aware system design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["power-aware system design","FPGA","energy harvesting","solar energy","harvesting-aware applications"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7266954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"An Architecture Model for Harvesting-Aware Applications in FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7266954/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15457992","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","conferenceDate":"7-10 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Architecture Model for Harvesting-Aware Applications in FPGA","confLoc":"Grenoble, France","sourcePdf":"6971a153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031248S","chronDate":"7-10 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7264388","isNumber":"7266915","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7264388","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7266915","articleId":"7266954","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7266958,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Saeid Masoumzadeh","affiliation":["Research Group Entertainment Computing, University of Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Seyed Saeid","lastName":"Masoumzadeh","id":"37080920000"},{"name":"Helmut Hlavacs","affiliation":["Research Group Entertainment Computing, University of Vienna, Austria"],"firstName":"Helmut","lastName":"Hlavacs","id":"37391604200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6971-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6970-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7266958","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":165},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Virtual machining","Decision making","Energy consumption","Optimization","Data models","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","computer centres","learning (artificial intelligence)","multi-agent systems","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed dynamic virtual machine consolidation","multi-agent learning approach","DDVMC","virtual machine management strategy","energy savings","cloud data center","energy-performance tradeoff"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Virtual Machine Consolidation","Multi Agent Learning"]}],"abstract":"Distributed dynamic virtual machine (VM) consolidation (DDVMC) is a virtual machine management strategy that uses a distributed rather than a centralized algorithm for finding a right balance between saving energy and attaining best possible performance in cloud data center.

A receiver-compatible EDTV system is described based on this method, as well as on a method of conforming the 16:9 aspect ratio of the EDTV system to the 4:3 aspect ratio of NTSC without using side panels. Finally, a scheme for hiding digital audio in chrominance is discussed. The three techniques are independent. \u2014 It is found that when video signals are transmitted in the usual over-the-air channels, if the SNR is satisfactory at the receiver, it is actually higher than required in some spatial-frequency bands. This \u2018noise margin\u2019 provides a place to add a large amount of extra information. The additional video information is hidden in such a way that the added signal appears on NTSC receivers as low-level additive random noise, processed and distributed so as to minimize its visibility, while at the same time achieving the maximum possible SNR of the hidden information. On a special EDTV receiver, the second signal is detected independently, combined with the first signal, and displayed at high resolution. The method does require a channel SNR high enough to make good NTSC pictures; however, an adequate SNR is required for any method of transmitting high-quality NTSC-compatible EDTV/HDTV images through analog channels. \u2014 As an alternative to transmitting side panels, a wide aspect ratio on the EDTV display is achieved by discarding a portion of the height of the transmitted image as displayed on a normal receiver, having previously ensured that the areas so discarded are free of significant content. Thus, both screens can be completely filled, but the appearance on the EDTV display is favored, since the image is originally composed for the wide screen, in the same manner as in 1.85:1 film, and possibly visible seams are avoided. \u2014 It is shown that the NTSC chrominance channel has excess temporal and vertical resolution. At the cost of a very small decrease in luminance resolution on today's most expensive receivers, a scheme is introduced for transmitting digital audio in the excess temporal bandwidth. The excess vertical chrominance resolution is used to increase chrominance horizontal resolution, which is very low in NTSC. These methods are useable independently of the noise-margin method for increasing luminance resolution and aspect ratio, and could be added to today's system, although not to existing receivers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Compatible High-Definition Television System using the Noise-Margin Method of Hiding Enhancement Information","publicationTitle":"Better Video Images: 23rd Annual SMPTE Television Conference","doi":"10.5594/M00760","displayPublicationTitle":"Better Video Images: 23rd Annual SMPTE Television Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7268231/7268232/07268262.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"389","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/M00760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7268232","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268262","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268262/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-4 Feb. 1989","displayDocTitle":"A Compatible High-Definition Television System using the Noise-Margin Method of Hiding Enhancement Information","conferenceDate":"3-4 Feb. 1989","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 1989","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Compatible High-Definition Television System using the Noise-Margin Method of Hiding Enhancement Information","confLoc":"San Francisco, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10-5594_M00760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03684S","chronDate":"3-4 Feb. 1989","isNumber":"7268232","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7268231","citationCount":"1","articleId":"7268262","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1989","subType":"SMPTE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":7268565,"authors":[{"name":"W.

However, the centralized infrastructure-based system has not been designed for efficiently disseminating the information of common interest (IoCI) to numerous requesters. Thanks to the rapid development of mobile devices equipped with large storage and multiple communication modes, opportunistic communication between a pair of MUs can be readily realized. With the aid of opportunistic networks formed by MUs, we can improve the connectivity of cellular networks in the rural areas, we can offload the tele-traffic from the overloaded cellular networks, and we can efficiently disseminate the IoCI in the densely populated areas. We commence with a detailed survey on the cross-disciplinary research area of social network analysis aided telecommunication networking. We continue by focusing our attention on the family of integrated cellular and large-scale opportunistic networks, whose performance is dominated by the inter-contact duration as well as the contact duration between any pairs of MUs. A continuous-time-pure-birth Markov chain is invoked for analyzing the relevant performance. We demonstrate that the delivery ratio of the IoCI before it expires becomes higher than 90% with the aid of opportunistic networks consisting of 20 MUs. Moreover, our experiments based on the InfoCom 2006 mobility trace show that the opportunistic networks are capable of offloading 58% of the tele-traffic from the cellular networks. Thereafter, we propose a hybrid information dissemination scheme for the integrated cellular and small-scale opportunistic networks, which is comprised of two main stages: 1) the base station-aided single-hop multicast (BSSHM) stage and 2) the cooperative multicast aided spontaneous dissemination stage. In contrast to their large-scale counterparts, in small-scale opportunistic networks, the information dissemination is mainly affected by the mobility of the MUs, by the wireless channel attenuation and by the resource scheduling, where a discrete-time-pure-birth Markov chain is utilized for characterizing the relevant performance. We demonstrate that our hybrid information dissemination scheme outperforms the traditional BSSHM in terms of various delay metrics, despite consuming less energy.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2477307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2477307","startPage":"1809","endPage":"1848","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07268759.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bridging the Social and Wireless Networking Divide: Information Dissemination in Integrated Cellular and Opportunistic Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","displayDocTitle":"Bridging the Social and Wireless Networking Divide: Information Dissemination in Integrated Cellular and Opportunistic Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7268759/","isOpenAccess":true,"accessionNumber":"15511125","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268759/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"RC\u2013UK.\u2019s India\u2013U.K. Advanced Technology Centre"},{"fundingName":"European Union\u2019s Concerto Project"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004543","fundingName":"China Scholarship Council"},{"fundingName":"European Research Council under its Advanced Fellow Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Bridging the Social and Wireless Networking Divide: Information Dissemination in Integrated Cellular and Opportunistic Networks","sourcePdf":"access-hanzo-2477307-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.209468S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7268759","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7268764,"authors":[{"name":"Kaikai Chi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University of Technology, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6488907/7523345/7268764/kachi-2478840-small.gif","p":["Kaikai Chi (GSM\u201906\u2013M\u201909) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China, in 2002 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2009.","From April 2009 to March 2010, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow with the Graduate School of Information Sciences, Tohoku University.

This paper focuses on WNSNs adopting the on-off keying (OOK) modulator. So far, some existing low-weight (LW) codes with low average codeword weight (ACW) map source symbols into different codewords with fewer high bits so as to greatly reduce the transmission energy at the transmitter. However, the transmission energy reduction is achieved at the price of large reception energy at the receiver as the codeword lengths of LW codes are large, incurring their ineffectiveness in most scenarios. To remedy the problem, we design the fixed-length minimum-communication-energy (F-MCE) code and variable-length minimum-communication-energy (V-MCE) code to minimize the total energy consumption at the transmitter and receiver for point-to-point communication in OOK-based WNSNs. Specifically, the code design problems are formulated as integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problems, and the F-MCE and V-MCE codes are obtained by solving the INLP problems. The F-MCE and V-MCE codes are applicable in more scenarios than the LW code. Extensive experimental results show that the V-MCE always outperforms the LW code regarding the energy saving, while the F-MCE code achieves energy saving no less than that of the existing LW codes.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JIOT.2015.2478840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7523345","publicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Internet of Things Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/6488907/7523345/07268764.pdf","endPage":"493","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coding Schemes to Minimize Energy Consumption of Communication Links in Wireless Nanosensor Networks","doi":"10.1109/JIOT.2015.2478840","startPage":"480","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Coding Schemes to Minimize Energy Consumption of Communication Links in Wireless Nanosensor Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268764/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16180604","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7268764/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61472367, 61432015 and 61379124"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004731","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province","grantNumber":"LY15F020027 and LY15F020029"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coding Schemes to Minimize Energy Consumption of Communication Links in Wireless Nanosensor Networks","sourcePdf":"jiot-chi-2478840-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142139S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6488907","isNumber":"7523345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6488907","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7523345","articleId":"7268764","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7268769,"authors":[{"name":"Bill Bowhill","affiliation":["Intel, Hudson, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7368951/7268769/7268769-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bill Bowhill received the Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) degree in electronic engineering from Liverpool University, U.K., in 1981.","He is a Senior Principal Engineer working at Intel's Massachusetts Microprocessor Design Center.

The implemented direct-sampling radar can reconstruct the scanning waveforms in digital domain. The link budget of the radar transceivers is analyzed for the overall scanning range. The scanning range of the radar is dependent on the TOF between radar transmitter and receiver. The range resolution of the pulsed TOF radar is determined by DTC. With the help of exquisite DTC, a high resolution radar can be achieved. The vernier concept has been adopted to achieve an accurate timing resolution design in the DTC. The vernier time steps are defined by the oscillating frequency of the phase-locked loops (PLL), and therefore the DTC with a high resolution in the order of picosecond and with high immunity to PVT variation was developed and demonstrated. The proposed radar was fabricated using 65 nm CMOS technology and occupies a chip area of 2 mm \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n, consumes 88.4 mW of DC power.

In contrast to conventional techniques and in order to reduce complexity, the relay nodes can either harvest energy from the source signal (in case of uncharged battery) or attempt to decode and forward it (in case of charged battery). Several relay selection schemes that correspond to different state information requirements and implementation complexities are proposed. The charging/discharging behavior of the battery is modeled as a two-state Markov chain and analytical expressions for the steady-state distribution and the outage probability performance are derived for each relay selection scheme. We prove that energy storage significantly affects the performance of the system and results in a zeroth diversity gain at high signal-to-noise ratios; the convergence floors depend on the steady-state distribution of the battery and are derived in closed form by using appropriate approximations. The proposed relay selection schemes are generalized to a large-scale network with multiple access points (APs), where relays assist the closest AP and suffer from multiuser interference.","doi":"10.1109/JSAC.2015.2479015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330054","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSAC.2015.2479015","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/49/7330054/07268782.pdf","startPage":"2596","endPage":"2610","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay Selection in Wireless Powered Cooperative Networks With Energy Storage","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Relay Selection in Wireless Powered Cooperative Networks With Energy Storage","volume":"33","issue":"12","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 November 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7268782/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15602326","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268782/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001810","fundingName":"Research Promotion Foundation, Cyprus","grantNumber":"CY-IL/0114/02"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay Selection in Wireless Powered Cooperative Networks With Energy Storage","sourcePdf":"jsac-krikidis-2479015-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.158617S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"49","isNumber":"7330054","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"7330054","articleId":"7268782","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7268785,"authors":[{"name":"Roohollah Yarahmadi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7352393/7268785/yarah-2477494-small.gif","p":["Roohollah Yarahmadi was born in Mashhad, Iran, in 1989.

Consequently, the EDFA will not work under its optimal state which has been already designed on the ground. To fix this problem, a study on the basic characteristics of EDFA under radiation is conducted. In the simulation tests, the gain of EDFA and the optimal length of the erbium-doped fiber both decrease with the dose of radiation. To dynamically adapt to such effects, a new self-adaptive system is established and makes an improvement of 7 dB in the gain when the radiation dose reaches 5000 Gy. This paper can practically benefit the design of the space optical communication systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/50/7273735/07268788.pdf","startPage":"4513","endPage":"4516","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/JLT.2015.2478805","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JLT.2015.2478805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7273735","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268788","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-Adaptive High Anti-Radiation EDFA for Space Optical Communication Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Erbium-doped fiber amplifiers","Optical fiber communication","Gain","Optical fiber amplifiers","Space radiation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive optics","erbium","optical communication equipment","optical fibre amplifiers","optical fibre communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-adaptive high antiradiation EDFA","space optical communication systems","amplification subsystem","erbium-doped fiber amplifier","space radiation effect","simulation tests","radiation dose"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Radiation effect","Free-space optical communication"]},{"kwd":["Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","free-space optical communication","radiation effect"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268788/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.1, 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Self-Adaptive High Anti-Radiation EDFA for Space Optical Communication Systems","volume":"33","issue":"21","htmlLink":"/document/7268788/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Nov.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"15484759","dateOfInsertion":"28 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61205045"},{"fundingName":"Suzhou Province Science and Technology development Program of China","grantNumber":"SYG201307"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Adaptive High Anti-Radiation EDFA for Space Optical Communication Systems","sourcePdf":"jlt-li-2478805-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10753S","chronDate":"Nov.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"50","isNumber":"7273735","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"7273735","articleId":"7268788","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7268791,"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrios Alanis","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7268791/alani-2478793-small.gif","p":["Dimitrios Alanis (S\u201913) received the M.Eng. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in 2011, and the M.Sc. degree in wireless communications from the University of Southampton, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree with the Southampton Wireless Group, School of Electronics and Computer Science.","His research interests include quantum computation and quantum information theory, quantum search algorithms, cooperative communications, resource allocation for self-organizing networks, bioinspired optimization algorithms, and classical and quantum game theory."]},"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Alanis","id":"37085567135"},{"name":"Panagiotis Botsinis","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Southampton, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7268791/botsi-2478793-small.gif","p":["Panagiotis Botsinis (S\u201912) received the M.Eng. degree from the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens, Greece, in 2010, and the M.Sc.

In \"Pure Serial Processing\" the full set of available keys has to be sequentially checked as to whether they do or do not unlock the door. On the other hand, independent and identical keyholes are used in the \"Pure Parallel Processing\" and in the \"Hybrid Parallel-Serial Processing\", where all the keys can be simultaneously inserted for unlocking the door. Subsequently, in \"Pure Quantum Processing\" a \"quantum\" keyhole in used, which is represented as an elaborate single lock having multiple keyholes for portraying the principles of the quantum parallelism. However, in quantum algorithms either the need for the synchronization of the parallel processes or the employment of the measurement or observation operation perturbs the delicate quantum processes and destroys the quantum parallelism. This perturbation is avoided by the decomposition of the task into a series of carefully coordinated serial steps, as portrayed with the aid of consecutive doors. These processing steps are classified as \"Hybrid Parallel-Serial Processing\" and \"Hybrid Quantum-Serial Processing\", respectively. Additionally, some independent processes may be simultaneously invoked in \"Hybrid Parallel-Quantum Processing\" for further reducing the complexity. Finally, an additional decomposition of the overall task into sequential steps may become inevitable for carefully coordinating the associated measurement or observation operations to avoid any undesired perturbations, leading to \"Hybrid Parallel-Quantum-Serial Processing\".","type":"video","fileSize":"21MB","file":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7268791/graphical_abstract/access-gavideo-2478793.mp4","coverImage":"/ielx7/6287639/7042252/7268791/graphical_abstract/access-gacovergraphic-2478793.jpg"},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantum computing","Wireless communication","Spread spectrum communication","Pareto optimization","Routing protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative methods","optimisation","quantum computing","telecommunication network routing","wireless mesh networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["average complexity reduction","NDQIO algorithm","nondominated quantum iterative optimization algorithm","optimal quantum-assisted algorithm","multiobjective routing problem","NDQO algorithm","optimum full-search-based performance","quantum parallelism","quantum computing","nondeterministic polynomial-time hard problem","WMHN","wireless multihop networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["WMHNs","Quantum Computing","Pareto Optimality","BBHT-QSA","DHA","NDQO"]},{"kwd":["WMHNs","quantum computing","Pareto optimality","BBHT-QSA","DHA","NDQO"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2478793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07268791.pdf","startPage":"1704","endPage":"1728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2478793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268791","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Dominated Quantum Iterative Routing Optimization for Wireless Multihop Networks","abstract":"Routing in wireless multihop networks (WMHNs) relies on a delicate balance of diverse and often conflicting parameters, when aiming for maximizing the WMHN performance. Classified as a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problem, routing in WMHNs requires sophisticated methods. As a benefit of observing numerous variables in parallel, quantum computing offers a promising range of algorithms for complexity reduction by exploiting the principle of quantum parallelism (QP), while achieving the optimum full-search-based performance. In fact, the so-called non-dominated quantum optimization (NDQO) algorithm has been proposed for addressing the multiobjective routing problem with the goal of achieving a near-optimal performance, while imposing a complexity of the order of O(N) and O(N\u221aN) in the best and worst case scenarios, respectively. However, as the number of nodes in the WMHN increases, the total number of routes increases exponentially, making its employment infeasible despite the complexity reduction offered. Therefore, we propose a novel optimal quantum-assisted algorithm, namely, the non-dominated quantum iterative optimization (NDQIO) algorithm, which exploits the synergy between the hardware and the QP for the sake of achieving a further complexity reduction, which is on the order of O(\u221aN) and O(N\u221aN) in the best and worst case scenarios, respectively. In addition, we provide simulation results for demonstrating that our NDQIO algorithm achieves an average complexity reduction of almost an order of magnitude compared with the near-optimal NDQO algorithm, while having the same order of power consumption.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268791/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15511108","htmlLink":"/document/7268791/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"3","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Non-Dominated Quantum Iterative Routing Optimization for Wireless Multihop Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Research Council Advanced Fellow Grant"},{"fundingName":"Royal Society\u2019s Wolfson Merit Award"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Non-Dominated Quantum Iterative Routing Optimization for Wireless Multihop Networks","sourcePdf":"access-hanzo-2478793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154229S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"7042252","articleId":"7268791","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7268835,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenyu Zhou","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Alternate Electrical Power System with Renewable Energy Sources, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, North China Electric Power University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6287639/7042252/7268835/zhou-2478863-small.gif","p":["Zhenyu Zhou (S\u201906\u2013M\u201911) received the M.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.

In this paper, we study the energy-efficient context-aware resource allocation problem, which falls into the category of mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) and is NP-hard. To provide a tractable solution, the MINLP problem is decoupled and reformulated as a one-to-one matching problem under two-sided preferences, which are modeled as the maximum energy efficiency that can be achieved under the expected matching. An iterative algorithm is developed to establish preference profiles by employing nonlinear fractional programming and Lagrange dual decomposition. Then, we propose an energy-efficient matching algorithm based on the Gale-Shapley algorithm, and provide the detailed discussion and analysis of stability, optimality, implementation issues, and algorithmic complexity. The proposed matching algorithm is also extended to scenarios with preference, indifference, and incomplete preference lists by introducing some tie-breaking and preference deletion rules. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significant performance and satisfaction gains compared with the conventional algorithms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2478863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7042252","startPage":"1849","endPage":"1860","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/7042252/07268835.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Context-Aware Matching for Resource Allocation in Ultra-Dense Small Cells","topic":"Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268835/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7268835/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Context-Aware Matching for Resource Allocation in Ultra-Dense Small Cells","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"2015","accessionNumber":"15511124","isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"3","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001691","fundingName":"Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research through the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS)","grantNumber":"15K15976 and 26730056"},{"fundingName":"JSPS A3 Foresight Program"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203100"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"13MS19, 14MS08 and 15MS04"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland","grantNumber":"284748 and 288473"},{"fundingName":"China Electric Power Research Institute through the State Grid Corporation of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Energy-Efficient Context-Aware Matching for Resource Allocation in Ultra-Dense Small Cells","sourcePdf":"access-dong-2478863-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.160086S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"7042252","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"7042252","topics":["Ultra-Dense Cellular Networks"],"articleId":"7268835","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7268836,"authors":[{"name":"Oscar Garc\u00eda","affiliation":["Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245517/7394954/7268836/garci-2479092-small.gif","p":["Oscar Garc\u00eda (M\u201999) was born in Madrid, Spain, in 1968.

The inductive load has been optimized to increase as much as possible the magnetic field at the center of it considering the physical restrictions. Into this inductor, an adiabatic probe filled with nanoparticles is placed being the main objective to increase its temperature. The control of the inverter has been designed in such a way that it is easy to try waveforms different from the classical sine waves to see its effect on the temperature of the sample. Although the research is in one of the early stages, the first conclusions about the optimal frequency and field have been obtained showing that this technique could be a real option in the future.","doi":"10.1109/JESTPE.2015.2479092","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394954","startPage":"243","endPage":"251","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245517/7394954/07268836.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JESTPE.2015.2479092","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Development and Testing of a New Instrument for Researching on Cancer Treatment Technologies Based on Magnetic Hyperthermia","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Heating","Radio frequency","Instruments","Magnetic fields","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer","hyperthermia","invertors","magnetic particles","nanoparticles","patient treatment","power inductors","silicon compounds","wide band gap semiconductors","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cancer treatment technology","magnetic hyperthermia","power electronics circuit","high-frequency magnetic field","cancer cell temperature","magnetic nanoparticles","high-frequency phase-shift inverter","SiC devices","natural zero voltage switching","inductive load","power inductor","adiabatic probe","optimal frequency","SiC"]},{"kwd":["Cancer treatment","magnetic hyperthermia","nanomaterials","PWM Inverter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Development and Testing of a New Instrument for Researching on Cancer Treatment Technologies Based on Magnetic Hyperthermia","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268836/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","dateOfInsertion":"29 January 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7268836/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15754639","publicationDate":"March 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Development and Testing of a New Instrument for Researching on Cancer Treatment Technologies Based on Magnetic Hyperthermia","sourcePdf":"jestpe-garcia-2479092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098469S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6245517","isNumber":"7394954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245517","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7394954","articleId":"7268836","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7268838,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Liu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Radar Signal Processing, Xidian University, Xi\u2019an, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/7352393/7268838/liu-2478808-small.gif","p":["Lei Liu was born in Henan, China, in 1990.

A novel multi-targets ISAR imaging method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and modified CLEAN technique is proposed in this paper. First, multi-targets are modeled as several separated group-targets in which translational motion of each target is analogous. And then, translational motion of each group-target is modeled as a polynomial, and the polynomial coefficient vector is estimated via the PSO-based iteration. Furthermore, a well-focused image of the group-target can be obtained and extracted via the proposed modified CLEAN technique. Meanwhile, each target can be segmented and extracted based on clustering number estimation and K-means clustering algorithm. Finally, better focused image of each target would be obtained through further traditional mono-target imaging processing. Experimental results verify the validity of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2015.2478808","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/7352393/07268838.pdf","startPage":"97","endPage":"108","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","publicationTitle":"IEEE

The problem of multiple maxima at different ranges due to periodicity of FDA beampattern has been mitigated by using an FDA radar with logarithmic offset (log-FDA). This idea has achieved single maxima for a target in the desired range dimension. In this letter, we have proposed multiple-input-multiple-output frequency diverse array radar with logarithmic offset (MIMO-log-FDA), which can be used to produce single maxima for multiple targets present in different range bins. Using range bins concept along with logarithmic offset in each subarray of MIMO-FDA has not only allowed us to produce single maxima for each target in a particular range bin, but also to minimize the reflections from any other target. Simulation and results have verified the effectiveness of proposed scheme.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2015.2478964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7398195/07268870.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2015.2478964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398195","startPage":"885","endPage":"888","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Range-Bins-Based MIMO Frequency Diverse Array Radar With Logarithmic Frequency Offset","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Range-Bins-Based MIMO Frequency Diverse Array Radar With Logarithmic Frequency Offset","chronOrPublicationDate":"2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268870/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","publicationDate":"2016","accessionNumber":"15883700","dateOfInsertion":"22 March 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7268870/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Range-Bins-Based MIMO Frequency Diverse Array Radar With Logarithmic Frequency Offset","sourcePdf":"lawp-khan-2478964-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079835S","chronDate":"2016","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7398195","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7398195","articleId":"7268870","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7268872,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085537971"},{"name":"Zhiyong Chen","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Zhiyong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37278570700"},{"name":"Chengcai Mei","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Zhejiang Industry and Trade Vocational College, Wenzhou, 325001, China"],"firstName":"Chengcai","lastName":"Mei","id":"37085780359"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9286"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2523"},{"format":"CD","value":"2334-3303"}],"articleNumber":"7268872","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":890},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Control Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieeecss.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268872","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Output feedback","Switches","Observers","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","multi-agent systems","multi-robot systems","sampled data systems","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear sampled measurement output feedback control","multi-agent systems","MAS jointly-connected topologies","sampling instants","time interval","spanning tree"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multi-agent systems","consensus","cooperative control","sampled data control"]},{"kwd":["Consensus","cooperative control","multi-agent systems","sampled data control"]}],"abstract":"This note studies the consensus problem of a class of multi-agent systems (MASs) with linear dynamics, where each agent is able to use the specified measurement output (e.g., position) relative to its neighbors at certain sampling instants.

The objective of the weighted I1 optimization is to minimize the number of radiating elements. For the filter-and-sum beamforming structure, this is equivalent to minimizing the number of filters, each with a set of optimized coefficients. The multiple constraints are adopted to individually control the mainlobe and sidelobe pattern characteristics, so as to preserve the FI property in the mainlobe region while satisfying a given upper bound in the sidelobe region. The WNG constraint can also be incorporated into the proposed method to enhance the synthesis robustness. This method can be easily implemented by iterative second-order cone programming (SOCP), and only few iterations are required to reach the convergence. A set of examples for the synthesis of FI patterns with uniform sidelobe level (SLL) or multiple nulls, scannable FI patterns, and the synthesis of FI pattern for an arc array with directive elements, is presented to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method. The element saving is about 23.3%-50% for the test cases.","doi":"10.1109/TAP.2015.2478908","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel7/8/7337475/07268873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAP.2015.2478908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7337475","startPage":"5826","endPage":"5832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of Sparse Arrays With Frequency-Invariant-Focused Beam Patterns Under Accurate Sidelobe Control by Iterative Second-Order Cone Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268873","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of Sparse Arrays With Frequency-Invariant-Focused Beam Patterns Under Accurate Sidelobe Control by Iterative Second-Order Cone Programming","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15618649","dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7268873/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61301009"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Postdoctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2014M551843"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of Sparse Arrays With Frequency-Invariant-Focused Beam Patterns Under Accurate Sidelobe Control by Iterative Second-Order Cone Programming","sourcePdf":"tap-zhang-2478908-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083858S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8","isNumber":"7337475","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7337475","articleId":"7268873","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7268878,"authors":[{"name":"Iv\u00e1n N.

First, a new crucial lemma which includes and extends the classical exponential stability theorem is constructed. Then by using the lemma, new algebraic criteria of \u03c8-type synchronization (synchronization with general decay rate) for SNNs are established via the designed nonlinear feedback control. The \u03c8-type synchronization which is in a general framework is obtained by introducing a \u03c8-type function. It contains exponential synchronization, polynomial synchronization, and other synchronization as its special cases. The results of this paper are general, and they also complement and extend some previous results. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained results.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of a Class of Switched Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delays via Nonlinear Feedback Control","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2475277","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7567607/07268882.pdf","startPage":"2300","endPage":"2310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2475277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7567607","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268882","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268882/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of a Class of Switched Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delays via Nonlinear Feedback Control","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"46","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7268882/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2016","accessionNumber":"16302739","pubMedId":"26390507","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Key Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61134012"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"11271146 and 61374150"},{"fundingName":"Prior Development Field for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China","grantNumber":"20130142130012"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of a Class of Switched Neural Networks with Time-Varying Delays via Nonlinear Feedback Control","sourcePdf":"tcyb-shen-2475277-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.130162S","chronDate":"Oct.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7567607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7567607","articleId":"7268882","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7268883,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Yu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Guangdong University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6245516/8306164/7268883/yu-2479093-small.gif","p":["Rong Yu (S\u201905\u2013M\u201908) received the Ph.D. degree from Tsinghua University, China, in 2007.

Geo-distributed mobile cloud computing (GMCC) is a new scenario that adds geography consideration in mobile cloud computing. In GMCC, users are able to access cloud resources that are geographically close to their mobile devices. This is expected to reduce the communication delay and the service providers cost compared with the traditional centralized approach. In this paper, we focus on resource sharing through the cooperation among the service providers in geo-distributed mobile cloud computing. Then, we propose two different strategies for efficient resource cooperation in geographically distributed data centers. Furthermore, we present a coalition game theoretical approach to deal with the competition and the cooperation among the service providers. Utility functions have been specifically considered to incorporate the cost related to virtual machine migration and resource utilization. Illustrative results indicate that our proposed schemes are able to efficiently utilize limited resources with quality-of-service consideration.","doi":"10.1109/TETC.2015.2479093","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6245516/8306164/07268883.pdf","startPage":"72","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8306164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TETC.2015.2479093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decentralized and Optimal Resource Cooperation in Geo-Distributed Mobile Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268883/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-March  2018","displayDocTitle":"Decentralized and Optimal Resource Cooperation in Geo-Distributed Mobile Cloud Computing","htmlLink":"/document/7268883/","dateOfInsertion":"02 March 2018","publicationDate":"Jan.-March 2018","accessionNumber":"17613420","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"volume":"6","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61422201, 61370159, U1201253 and U1301255"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Guangdong Province Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"S2011030002886"},{"fundingName":"Special-Support Project of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2014TQ01X100"},{"fundingName":"High Education Excellent Young Teacher Program of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"YQ2013057"},{"fundingName":"Science and Technology Program of Guangzhou through the Zhujiang New Star Program","grantNumber":"2014J2200097"},{"fundingName":"Research Council of Norway","grantNumber":"240079/F20"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission FP7 Project CROWN","grantNumber":"PIRSES-GA-2013-627490"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Decentralized and Optimal Resource Cooperation in Geo-Distributed Mobile Cloud Computing","sourcePdf":"tetc-zhang-2479093-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109586S","chronDate":"Jan.-March  2018","xplore-pub-id":"6245516","isNumber":"8306164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6245516","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"8306164","articleId":"7268883","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2018","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7268887,"authors":[{"name":"Cristian Zambelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7298/7339738/7268887/zambe-2478918-small.gif","p":["\n\nCristian Zambelli (M'12) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electronic \nengineering (with honors) from the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, in 2008 and 2012, \nrespectively.","Since 2015, he has been an Assistant Professor with the Dipartimento di Ingegneria, Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di \nFerrara.

When these signals are generated through a low-cost transmitter, the real modulation index can end up being quite different from the nominal value employed at the receiver and a significant performance degradation is observed unless proper techniques for the estimation and compensation are employed. For this reason, we design new binary schemes with a much higher robustness. They are based on the concatenation of a suitable precoder with binary input and a ternary CPM format. The result is a family of CPM formats whose phase state is constrained to follow a specific evolution. Two of these precoders are considered. We will discuss many aspects related to these schemes, such as the power spectral density, the spectral efficiency, simplified detection, the minimum distance, and the uncoded performance. The adopted precoders do not change the recursive nature of CPM schemes. So these schemes are still suited for serial concatenation, through a pseudo-random interleaver, with an outer channel encoder.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268889/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 November 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7268889/","accessionNumber":"15676737","displayDocTitle":"Binary Continuous Phase Modulations Robust to a Modulation Index Mismatch","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Binary Continuous Phase Modulations Robust to a Modulation Index Mismatch","sourcePdf":"tcomm-malek-2478819-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077566S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7328780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7328780","articleId":"7268889","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7268892,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Xiang","affiliation":["School of Software, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/7419205/7268892/xiang-2474365-small.gif","p":["Dong Xiang (SM\u201904) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, in 1987 and 1990, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer engineering from the Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 1993.","He was a Post-Doctoral Researcher with Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada, from 1994 to 1995 and the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA, from 1995 to 1996.

The problem worsens for 3-D ICs, where heat dissipation across layers is more unbalanced. These hotspots in a circuit often cause severe degradation of performance and reliability, as a rise in temperature can introduce an extra delay along paths. As a result, the delay of an otherwise fault-free path may exceed the functional clock period. Such thermal emergencies can thus lead to over-detection and undue yield loss during testing. Their effects will be more severe for small-delay defects (SDDs), which target to sensitize the long paths in a circuit. In this paper, we quantify, for the first time, the impact of thermal emergencies on SDDs and provide a solution to mitigate them. The proposed method is based on: 1) a new thermal-aware (TA) path-selection method, 2) a TA test-ordering method, and 3) an effective scan architecture and a test-application scheme. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate that the new method can significantly reduce the number of over-detections of SDDs.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474365","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/7419205/07268892.pdf","startPage":"499","endPage":"512","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2015.2474365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7419205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Thermal-Aware Small-Delay Defect Testing in Integrated Circuits for Mitigating Overkill","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Thermal-Aware Small-Delay Defect Testing in Integrated Circuits for Mitigating Overkill","dateOfInsertion":"24 February 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7268892/","accessionNumber":"15802949","volume":"35","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"60910003, 61170063 and 61373021"},{"fundingName":"Research Grant from Education Ministry","grantNumber":"20111081042"},{"fundingName":"High-End Foreign-Expert program of P.

In a microgrid, the background harmonic voltage (BHV) may distort the injected currents of the grid-tied inverters. In order to resist the effect of the BHV, a feedforward voltage compensator and a proportional resonant regulator with harmonic compensation are often adopted. However, they still have their own limitations, particularly when there are higher order BHVs at the point of common coupling and when the equivalent grid impedance widely varies due to the different numbers of grid-tied inverters in parallel. Thus, an extra damper should be inserted to keep the system stable. In this paper, the control bandwidth limitation of a multiloop control active damping (AD) method is analyzed and illustrated by the capacitor-current-feedback AD. Based on this, a single-loop current control with a hybrid damper is proposed for a single-phase LCLor LLCL-filter-based grid-tied inverter. A step-by-step design of the controller method is also introduced in detail. Experiments on a 2-kW prototype fully demonstrate the strong robustness of the stability and the high harmonic rejection ability of the inverter using the proposed control method.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2015.2478738","startPage":"926","endPage":"936","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7377137/07268896.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2015.2478738","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7377137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient and Robust Hybrid Damper for -- or --Based Grid-Tied Inverter With Strong Grid-Side Harmonic Voltage Effect Rejection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Delays","Impedance","Bandwidth","Power harmonic filters","Inductance","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed power generation","electric current control","invertors","power harmonic filters","power inductors","proportional control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient robust hybrid damper","LCL grid-tied inverter","LLCL-based grid-tied inverter","strong grid-side harmonic voltage effect rejection","high-order power filter","small grid-side inductor","microgrid","background harmonic voltage","BHV","feedforward voltage compensator","proportional resonant regulator","harmonic compensation","point of common coupling","grid impedance","control bandwidth limitation","multiloop control active damping","capacitor-current-feedback AD","single-loop current control","power 2 kW"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LCL-filter","LLCL-filter","Background harmonic voltage","Grid impedance variation","Harmonic-rejection-ability","Robustness","RC parallel damper","Notch filter","Single-loop"]},{"kwd":["Background harmonic voltage (BHV)","grid impedance variation","harmonic rejection ability","$LCL$-filter","$LLCL$-filter","notch filter","$RC$ parallel damper","robustness","single loop"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268896/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient and Robust Hybrid Damper for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LCL$</tex-math></inline-formula>- or <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LLCL$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Based Grid-Tied Inverter With Strong Grid-Side Harmonic Voltage Effect Rejection","volume":"63","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7268896/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15697161","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Project of Shanghai Pujiang Program","grantNumber":"14PJ1404200"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004894","fundingName":"Shuguang Project of Shanghai Municipal Education Commission","grantNumber":"14SG43"},{"fundingName":"National Science foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"51577114"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient and Robust Hybrid Damper for <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LCL$</tex-math></inline-formula>- or <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$LLCL$</tex-math></inline-formula>-Based Grid-Tied Inverter With Strong Grid-Side Harmonic Voltage Effect Rejection","sourcePdf":"tie-wu-2478738-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102212S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7377137","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"7377137","articleId":"7268896","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-09"},{"_id":7268900,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Sun","affiliation":["Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10/7412788/7268900/sun-small.gif","p":["Yu Sun (M'12) received the B.Eng. degree in biomedical\n engineering from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2005, the Ph.D. degree in\n electronic, electrical, and system engineering from Loughborough University, Leicestershire, U.K., in 2011, and the\n joint-Ph.D. degree in biomedical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, in 2012.","Since 2012, he has been a Postdoctoral Research Fellow and currently a Senior Research Fellow in the Singapore\n Institute for Neurotechnology (SINAPSE), National University of Singapore, Singapore.

Its ease of use, low cost and convenience make it an attractive area of research in the biomedical and clinical communities. Nevertheless, its single spot monitoring and the need to apply a PPG sensor directly to the skin limit its practicality in situations such as perfusion mapping and healing assessments or when free movement is required. The introduction of fast digital cameras into clinical imaging monitoring and diagnosis systems, the desire to reduce the physical restrictions, and the possible new insights that might come from perfusion imaging and mapping inspired the evolution of the conventional PPG technology to imaging PPG (IPPG). IPPG is a noncontact method that can detect heart-generated pulse waves by means of peripheral blood perfusion measurements. Since its inception, IPPG has attracted significant public interest and provided opportunities to improve personal healthcare. This study presents an overview of the wide range of IPPG systems currently being introduced along with examples of their application in various physiological assessments. We believe that the widespread acceptance of IPPG is happening, and it will dramatically accelerate the promotion of this healthcare model in the near future.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2476337","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7412788/07268900.pdf","startPage":"463","endPage":"477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7412788","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2476337","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photoplethysmography Revisited: From Contact to Noncontact, From Point to Imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2016","displayDocTitle":"Photoplethysmography Revisited: From Contact to Noncontact, From Point to Imaging","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268900/","publicationDate":"March 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 February 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15802417","pubMedId":"26390439","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7268900/","volume":"63","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National University of Singapore for Cognitive Engineering Group at Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology","grantNumber":"R-719-001-102-232"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photoplethysmography Revisited: From Contact to Noncontact, From Point to Imaging","sourcePdf":"tbme-sun-2476337-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.171288S","chronDate":"March  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7412788","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"233","xplore-issue":"7412788","articleId":"7268900","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":7268907,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Cao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California at Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/16/7302109/7268907/cao-2443039-small.gif","p":["Wei Cao (S\u201912) received the B.S. degree in physics from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in microelectronics and solid-state electronics from Fudan University, Shanghai, China, in 2011.

In this paper, dissipative quantum transport simulations using nonequilibrium Green's function formalism are performed to rigorously evaluate the scalability and performance of monolayer/multilayer 2D semiconductor-based FETs for sub-10 nm gate length very large-scale integration (VLSI) technologies. Device design considerations in terms of the choice of prospective 2D material/structure/technology to fulfill sub-10 nm International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) requirements are analyzed. First, it is found that MoS\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n FETs can meet high-performance (HP) requirement up to 6.6 nm gate length using bilayer MoS\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n as the channel material, while low-standby-power (LSTP) requirements present significant challenges for all sub-10 nm gate lengths. Second, by studying the effects of underlap (UL) structures, scattering strength, and carrier effective mass, it is found that the high mobility and suitably low effective mass of tungsten diselenide (WSe\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n), aided by the UL, enable 2D FETs for both HP and LSTP applications at the smallest foreseeable (5.9 nm) gate length. Finally, possible solutions for sub-5 nm gate lengths, specifically anisotropic 2D semiconductor materials for HP and sub-kT/q switch (2D tunnel FET) for LSTP, are also proposed based on the effects of critical material parameters on the device performance.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2443039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7302109/07268907.pdf","startPage":"3459","endPage":"3469","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2443039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7302109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2D Semiconductor FETs\u2014Projections and Design for Sub-10 nm VLSI","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268907/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"2D Semiconductor FETs\u2014Projections and Design for Sub-10 nm VLSI","volume":"62","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15552617","htmlLink":"/document/7268907/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"26 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000181","fundingName":"Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Arlington, VA, USA","grantNumber":"FA9550-14-1-0268 (R18641)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2D Semiconductor FETs\u2014Projections and Design for Sub-10 nm VLSI","sourcePdf":"ted-banerjee-2443039-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108761S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7302109","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"150","xplore-issue":"7302109","articleId":"7268907","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7268913,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Seifi","affiliation":["Ericsson Research, Stockholm, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7542099/7268913/seifi-2478843-small.gif","p":["\n\nNima Seifi received the B.S. degree from Isfahan University of \nTechnology, Isfahan, Iran, in 2005 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, \nSweden, in 2007 and 2012, respectively, all in electrical engineering.","From November 2009 to July 2010, he was a Visiting Scholar with the Wireless Networking and Communication Group, The \nUniversity of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.

We investigate the impact of the elevation angle of the BS antenna pattern, which is denoted as tilt, on the performance of the considered network when employing either a traditional single-cell transmission or a fully cooperative multicell transmission. Using the results of this investigation, we propose a novel hybrid multicell cooperation technique in which the intercell interference is controlled via either cooperative beamforming in the horizontal plane or coordinated beamforming in the vertical plane of the wireless channel, which is denoted as adaptive multicell 3-D beamforming. The main idea is to divide the coverage area into two disjoint vertical regions and adapt the multicell cooperation strategy at the BSs when serving each region. A fair scheduler is used to share the time slots between the vertical regions. It is shown that the proposed technique can achieve performance comparable with that of a fully cooperative transmission but with significantly lower complexity and signaling requirements. To facilitate computationally efficient simulation and design space exploration, accurate approximations of the user ergodic rate are proposed for different transmission strategies under imperfect CSI.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2478843","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07268913.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2478843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","startPage":"6217","endPage":"6231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Multicell 3-D Beamforming in Multiantenna Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268913","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/25/7542099/7268913-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Multicell 3-D Beamforming in Multiantenna Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268913/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16209982","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7268913/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001858","fundingName":"Swedish Governmental Agency for Innovation Systems (VINNOVA)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004359","fundingName":"Swedish Research Council (VR)","grantNumber":"621-2009-4555"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"NSF-CCF-1218338"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Adaptive Multicell 3-D Beamforming in Multiantenna Cellular Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-seifi-2478843-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101521S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"29","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7268913","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7268914,"authors":[{"name":"Won-Chul Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Won-Chul","lastName":"Choi","id":"37678341800"},{"name":"Dong-Jo Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Jo","lastName":"Park","id":"37275454000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7268914","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relay networks (telecommunications)","MIMO","Iterative methods","Silicon","Optimization","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","iterative methods","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative beamformer","multinode MIMO two way relay","multiple input multiple output relay networks","minimum mean square error","iterative algorithm","closed form solutions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplify-and-forward two-way relay network","beamformer design","mean-square-error (MSE) duality","multinode","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, an iterative design method for beamformers is proposed for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) two-way relay networks with multiple pairs of source nodes.

To manage this difficulty, a novel iterative algorithm is proposed, which uses duality relationships. First, the MSE duality for MIMO two-way relay networks with multiple pairs of nodes is presented. Moreover, the optimization problem is divided into three subproblems, which can be separately solved; then, the duality is applied to the proposed iterative algorithm, which provides closed-form solutions for all subproblems.

In this paper, we exploit the network cooperation in HetNets to propose two joint radio resource management (JRRM) schemes that improve energy savings while satisfying the system quality-of-service (QoS) performance requirements. First, we present an optimal QoS-aware energy-efficient JRRM scheme, which is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process model, and provide the optimal control policy for the HetNet under analysis. Second, we present an implementation-friendly QoS-aware energy-efficient JRRM scheme that utilizes a threshold on the macrocell radio resource occupancy to trigger the switching-on/off procedure of the base transceiver station resources, as well as a load-balancing procedure to minimize the service disruptions that may occur because of radio resource shortage and to reduce power consumption during the HetNet operation. This JRRM scheme is analyzed by means of a multidimensional continuous-time Markov chain model. Third, we devise an algorithm to determine the threshold setting in the implementation-friendly JRRM scheme according to a desirable power saving level that is prespecified by the mobile network operator. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes achieve substantial energy savings while keeping satisfactory performance levels.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2478852","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7542099/07268924.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2478852","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542099","startPage":"6343","endPage":"6365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Energy-Efficient Joint Radio Resource Management in Multi-RAT Heterogeneous Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268924","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware Energy-Efficient Joint Radio Resource Management in Multi-RAT Heterogeneous Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268924/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"65","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","accessionNumber":"16210016","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7268924/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003593","fundingName":"Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient\u00edfico e Tecnol\u00f3gico (CNPq)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)","grantNumber":"RGPIN/293233-2011"},{"fundingName":"NSERC through Discovery Grants"},{"fundingName":"NSERC Strategic Project","grantNumber":"STPGP 430285-12"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware Energy-Efficient Joint Radio Resource Management in Multi-RAT Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-anpalagan-2478852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133494S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7268924","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7268925,"authors":[{"name":"Miroslav Vasi\u0107","affiliation":["Centro de Electr\u00f3nica Industrial, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7268925/vasic-small.gif","p":["Miroslav Vasi\u0107 (M\u201910) was born in Serbia in 1981.

In this study, a multilevel multiphase buck converter is presented as a solution for the envelope amplifier used in ET and EER. The presented multiphase buck converter generates multilevel voltage using \u201cnode\u201d duty cycles and nonlinear control. In this way, the multilevel is implemented using only one simple power stage. However, the complexity of the multilevel converter implementation has been shifted from complicated power topologies to complicated digital control. Detailed discussion regarding the influence of the design parameters (switching frequency, output filter, and time resolution of the digital control) on the performance of the proposed envelope amplifier is presented. The design of the output filter is conducted fulfilling the constraints of the envelope slew rate and minimum driver pulse that can be reproduced. In the cases when these two constraints cannot be fulfilled, they may be relieved by the modified control that is presented and experimentally validated. Finally, in order to validate the concept, a prototype has been designed and integrated with a nonlinear class F amplifier. Efficiency measurements showed that by employing EER, it is possible to save up to 15% of power losses, comparing to the case when it is supplied by a constant voltage. Additionally, adjacent channel power ratio has been measured.

With perfect carrier phase synchronization, it has been revealed that CB guarantees a stable main lobe, regardless of the locations of the collaborative nodes. However, the sidelobe locations and the level of CB cannot be predicted due to random deployment of the nodes. A high-order sidelobe will cause severe interference to unintended receivers and degrade network capacity. Known sidelobe control methods suffer from exponential complexity with the number of unintended receivers. We tackle this by a novel algorithm that uses decentralized cross-entropy optimization (CEO) to search over different node combinations, which is proven to find the optimal solution with probability one. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme and illustrate that the proposed scheme can achieve greater interference rejection at much lower complexity compared with a conventional method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268926/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7268926/","dateOfInsertion":"11 August 2016","accessionNumber":"16210026","volume":"65","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Sensor-Node Selection Algorithm for Sidelobe Control in Collaborative Beamforming","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 104-2221-E-017-004"},{"fundingName":"MOST of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST 103-2221-E-110-029-MY3"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Sensor-Node Selection Algorithm for Sidelobe Control in Collaborative Beamforming","sourcePdf":"tvt-wen-2478898-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091726S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7542099","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7542099","articleId":"7268926","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7268930,"authors":[{"name":"Hongchen Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7268930/liu-small.gif","p":["Hongchen Liu received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from\n Northeast Agricultural University, Harbin, China, in 2001, and the master's and Ph.D. degrees in electrical\n engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, in 2003 and 2007, respectively.","From 2008 to 2012, he was a Postdoctoral Fellow in measuring and controlling technology and instrument specialty.

The proposed converter is composed of the dual switches structure, three-winding coupled inductor, and two voltage multiplier cells in order to achieve the high step-up voltage gain. The dual switches structure is beneficial to reduce the voltage stress and current stress of the switch. In addition, two multiplier capacitors are, respectively, charged during the switch-on period and switch-off period, which increases the voltage conversion gain. Meanwhile, the energy stored in the leakage inductor is recycled with the use of clamped capacitors. Thus, two main power switches with low on-resistance and low current stress are available. As the leakage inductor, diode reverse-recovery problem is also alleviated. Therefore, the efficiency is improved. This paper illustrates the operation principle of the proposed converter; discusses the effect of the leakage inductor; analyzes the influence of parasitic parameters on the voltage gain and efficiency, the voltage stresses and current stresses of power devices are shown; and a comparison between the performance of the proposed converter and the previous high step-up converters is performed. Finally, the prototype circuit with input voltage 20 V, output voltage 200 V, and rated power 200 W is operated to verify its performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2478809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2478809","startPage":"4974","endPage":"4983","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7394209/07268930.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7394209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel High Step-Up Dual Switches Converter With Coupled Inductor and Voltage Multiplier Cell for a Renewable Energy System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Novel High Step-Up Dual Switches Converter With Coupled Inductor and Voltage Multiplier Cell for a Renewable Energy System","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","volume":"31","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7268930/","accessionNumber":"15754666","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268930/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Postdoctoral science-research developmental foundation of Heilongjiang province","grantNumber":"LHB-Q12086"},{"fundingName":"National Key Basic Research Program of China 973 Program","grantNumber":"2013CB035605"},{"fundingName":"specialized research fund for the doctoral program of higher education","grantNumber":"20132302110013"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"51107016"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel High Step-Up Dual Switches Converter With Coupled Inductor and Voltage Multiplier Cell for a Renewable Energy System","sourcePdf":"tpel-liu-2478809-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086351S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7394209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"7394209","articleId":"7268930","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":7268931,"authors":[{"name":"Abdelhamid Younis","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, The University of Benghazi, Benghazi, Libya"],"firstName":"Abdelhamid","lastName":"Younis","id":"37706744500"},{"name":"Raed Mesleh","affiliation":["Department of Communications Engineering, School of Computer Engineering and Information Technology, German Jordanian University, Amman, Jordan"],"firstName":"Raed","lastName":"Mesleh","id":"37296995700"},{"name":"Harald Haas","affiliation":["Institute for Digital Communications, College of Science and Engineering, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, U.K."],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Haas","id":"37269894900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9545"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1939-9359"}],"articleNumber":"7268931","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":35,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1288},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Vehicular Technology Society","url":"http://www.vtsociety.org/"}],"abstract":"This paper analyzes the performance of the recently proposed quadrature spatial modulation (QSM) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system over Nakagami-m fading channel. In the analysis, the general distribution of the Nakagami-m channel phase is considered. In the literature, performance analysis of spatial modulation (SM) over Nakagami-m channel with uniform phase is conducted. However, apart from the very special case of m = 1, where Nakagami-m fading corresponds to Rayleigh fading, the phase of the Nakagami-m distribution is not uniformly distributed. It is shown in this paper that the phase of the channel has major impact on the performance of spatial multiplexing MIMO systems such as SM and QSM systems. A general upper bound expression for the average bit error ratio (ABER) performance of QSM is derived, and the impact of different channel parameters is studied. Monte Carlo simulation results are provided to corroborate the exactness of the derived analysis.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7779452/07268931.pdf","startPage":"10227","endPage":"10231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2478841","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2478841","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7779452","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7268931","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quadrature Spatial Modulation Performance Over Nakagami- $m$ Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Modulation","Rayleigh channels","Indexes","Antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami channels","Rayleigh channels","space division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nakagami-m fading channels","QSM MIMO system","quadrature spatial modulation multiple-input-multiple-output system","Nakagami-m channel phase distribution","spatial multiplexing MIMO systems","general upper bound expression","average bit error ratio performance","ABER performance","Monte Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)","Nakagami-  $m$   fading","performance analysis","quadrature spatial modulation (QSM)","spatial modulation (SM)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268931/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","displayDocTitle":"Quadrature Spatial Modulation Performance Over Nakagami- $m$ Fading Channels","volume":"65","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7268931/","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2016","accessionNumber":"16540382","dateOfInsertion":"14 December 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quadrature Spatial Modulation Performance Over Nakagami- $m$ Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-younis-2478841-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.056358S","chronDate":"Dec.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7779452","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"7779452","articleId":"7268931","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7268934,"authors":[{"name":"Tomislav Dragi\u010devi\u0107","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7394209/7268934/dragi-small.gif","p":["Tomislav Dragi\u010devi\u0107 (S'09\u2013M'13)\n received the M.E.E. and the industrial Ph.D. degrees from the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Zagreb, Croatia, in\n 2009 and 2013, respectively.

Overall control is systematically classified into local and coordinated control levels according to respective functionalities in each level. As opposed to local control, which relies only on local measurements, some line of communication between units needs to be made available in order to achieve the coordinated control. Depending on the communication method, three basic coordinated control strategies can be distinguished, i.e., decentralized, centralized, and distributed control. Decentralized control can be regarded as an extension of the local control since it is also based exclusively on local measurements. In contrast, centralized and distributed control strategies rely on digital communication technologies. A number of approaches using these three coordinated control strategies to achieve various control objectives are reviewed in this paper. Moreover, properties of dc MG dynamics and stability are discussed. This paper illustrates that tightly regulated point-of-load converters tend to reduce the stability margins of the system since they introduce negative impedances, which can potentially oscillate with lightly damped power supply input filters. It is also demonstrated that how the stability of the whole system is defined by the relationship of the source and load impedances, referred to as the minor loop gain. Several prominent specifications for the minor loop gain are reviewed. Finally, a number of active stabilization techniques are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268934/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","volume":"31","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15754682","dateOfInsertion":"28 January 2016","publicationDate":"July 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7268934/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"DC Microgrids\u2014Part I: A Review of Control Strategies and Stabilization Techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DC Microgrids\u2014Part I: A Review of Control Strategies and Stabilization Techniques","sourcePdf":"tpel-dragicevic-2478859-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17142S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7394209","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"532","xplore-issue":"7394209","articleId":"7268934","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-23"},{"_id":7268936,"authors":[{"name":"Saif Khan Mohammed","affiliation":["Bharti School of Telecommunication Technology and Management (BSTTM), I.I.T., Delhi, Delhi, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7401212/7268936/moham-2478878-small.gif","p":["Saif Khan Mohammed (S\u201908\u2013M\u201911) received the B.Tech. degree in computer science and engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (I.I.T.), Delhi, India, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and communication engineering from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, in 1998 and 2010, respectively.

We propose a novel user grouping precoder which improves the sum rate performance of the zero-forcing (ZF) precoder specially when the channel is ill-conditioned. The proposed precoder partitions all the users into small groups of equal size. Downlink beamforming is then done in such a way that, at each user's receiver, the interference from the signal intended for users not in its group is nulled out. Intragroup interference still remains, and is cancelled through successive interference presubtraction at the BS using dirty paper coding (DPC). The proposed user grouping method is different from user selection, since it is a method for precoding of information to the selected (scheduled) users, and not for selecting which users are to be scheduled. The proposed precoder is a generalization of two special cases, one where each group has only one user (ZF precoder) and another where all users are in a single group (ZF-DP precoder). A larger group size helps improve the sum rate performance but at the cost of greater complexity. The proposed generalization, therefore, allows for tradeoff between performance and complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2478878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7401212","startPage":"811","endPage":"826","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7401212/07268936.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2478878","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving the Performance of the Zero-Forcing Multiuser MISO Downlink Precoder Through User Grouping","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Complexity theory","Wireless communication","Resource management","Array signal processing","Encoding","Silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","broadcast channels","Gaussian channels","interference suppression","precoding","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-forcing multiuser MISO downlink precoder performance","multiple input single output Gaussian broadcast channel","base station","single-antenna","user grouping precoder","sum rate performance","downlink beamforming","intragroup interference cancellation","successive interference presubtraction","dirty paper coding","DPC","user selection","ZF-DP precoder","MIMO broadcast channel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO broadcast channel","precoding","low-complexity","user grouping","dirty paper coding","zero-forcing"]},{"kwd":["MIMO broadcast channel","precoding","low complexity","user grouping","dirty paper coding","zero-forcing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Performance of the Zero-Forcing Multiuser MISO Downlink Precoder Through User Grouping","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7268936/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 September 2015","dateOfInsertion":"08 February 2016","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/7268936/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15785910","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EMR funding from the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)"},{"fundingName":"Swedish Research Council and ELLIIT."},{"fundingName":"IEEE Globecom 2011"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Performance of the Zero-Forcing Multiuser MISO Downlink Precoder Through User Grouping","sourcePdf":"twc-mohammed-2478878-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152992S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7401212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7401212","articleId":"7268936","onlineDate":"15 September 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7269092,"authors":[{"name":"Takayuki Yamashita","affiliation":["NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corp.), 1-10-11 Kinuta, Setagaya-ku, TOKYO 1578510"],"firstName":"Takayuki","lastName":"Yamashita"},{"name":"Ryohei Funatsu","affiliation":["NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corp.), 1-10-11 Kinuta, Setagaya-ku, TOKYO 1578510"],"firstName":"Ryohei","lastName":"Funatsu"},{"name":"Tadaaki Yanagi","affiliation":["Hitachi Kokusai Electric Inc., 32 Miyuki-cho, Kodaira-shi, TOKYO 1878511"],"firstName":"Tadaaki","lastName":"Yanagi"},{"name":"Kohji Mitani","affiliation":["NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corp.), 1-10-11 Kinuta, Setagaya-ku, TOKYO 1578510"],"firstName":"Kohji","lastName":"Mitani"},{"name":"Yuji Nojiri","affiliation":["NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corp.), 1-10-11 Kinuta, Setagaya-ku, TOKYO 1578510"],"firstName":"Yuji","lastName":"Nojiri"},{"name":"Tetsuo Yoshida","affiliation":["Hitachi Kokusai Electric Inc., 32 Miyuki-cho, Kodaira-shi, TOKYO 1878511"],"firstName":"Tetsuo","lastName":"Yoshida"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61482-944-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7269092","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":7},"keywords":[{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Camera","Ultra-high definition","CMOS image sensor","Chromatic aberration","Super Hi-Vision"]}],"abstract":"We describe a world's-first camera system that can capture images complying with the highest-level image format specified in SMPTE 2036-1\u2014 i.e. UHDTV2 (7680 \u00d74320/59.94p, R/G/B 4:4:4).

Not only is the number of archivists limited, the time they can spend on annotating one item is insufficient to create time-based and detailed descriptions about the content to make fully optimized video search possible. Furthermore, we observe an accelerated increase in newly created audiovisual material that must be described due to introduction of file-based production methods. \u2014 Fortunately, more and more high-quality feature extraction tools are being developed by research institutes. These tools examine the audiovisual essence and return particular information about the analyzed video and/or audio streams. For example, tools can automatically detect shot boundaries, detect and recognize faces and objects, segment audio streams, etc. As a result, they quickly and cheaply generate metadata that can be used for indexing and searching. On top of that, it relieves archivists of performing tedious and repetitive, but necessary low-added value tasks, for example identifying within an audio stream the speech and music segments. Although most tools are currently not yet commercially offered, it is to be expected that these solutions soon will become available for broadcasters and media companies alike. \u2014 In this paper, we describe a solution on how to integrate such feature extraction tools within the annotation workflow of a media company. This solution, in the form of an architecture and workflow, is scalable, extensible, loosely coupled, and has clear and easy to implement interfaces. As such, our architecture allows one to plug in additional tools irrespective of the software and hardware used by the media company. \u2014 By integrating feature extraction tools within the workflow of annotating audiovisual essence, more and better metadata can be created allowing other tools to improve indexing, search and retrieval of media material within audiovisual archives.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7269153/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Oct. 2009","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Oct. 2009","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Architecture for Embedding Audiovisual Feature Extraction Tools in Archives","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architecture for Embedding Audiovisual Feature Extraction Tools in Archives","confLoc":"Hollywood, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10-5594_M001332.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050032S","chronDate":"27-29 Oct. 2009","isNumber":"7269114","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269113","articleId":"7269153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"SMPTE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":7269373,"authors":[{"name":"Thomas M.

The survey was broken down into several segments: content capture, editing and post-production, content delivery as well as archiving and digital preservation.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2014 Survey Summary for Storage in Professional Media and Entertainment","publicationTitle":"SMPTE 2014 Annual Technical Conference & Exhibition","doi":"10.5594/M001576","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE 2014 Annual Technical Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269330/7269331/07269373.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/M001576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7269331","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7269373","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7269373/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Oct. 2014","displayDocTitle":"2014 Survey Summary for Storage in Professional Media and Entertainment","conferenceDate":"20-23 Oct. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2014 Survey Summary for Storage in Professional Media and Entertainment","confLoc":"Hollywood, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10-5594_M001576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083355S","chronDate":"20-23 Oct. 2014","isNumber":"7269331","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269330","citationCount":"2","articleId":"7269373","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"SMPTE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7269424,"authors":[{"name":"Debargha Mukherjee","affiliation":["Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043"],"firstName":"Debargha","lastName":"Mukherjee"},{"name":"Jingning Han","affiliation":["Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043"],"firstName":"Jingning","lastName":"Han"},{"name":"Jim Bankoski","affiliation":["Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Bankoski"},{"name":"Ronald Bultje","affiliation":["Two Sigma, 379 W.

Starting from the VP8 video codec released by Google in 2010 as the baseline, various enhancements and new tools were added, resulting in the next-generation bit-stream VP9. The bit-stream was finalized with the exception of essential bug-fixes, in June 2013. Prior to the release however, all technical developments in fact were being conducted openly in the public experimental branch of the repository for many months. This paper provides a brief technical overview of the coding tools included in VP9, along with coding performance comparisons with other state-of-the-art video codecs \u2014 namely H.264/AVC and HEVC \u2014 on standard test sets. While a completely fair comparison is impossible to conduct because of the limitations of the respective encoder implementations, the tests show VP9 to be quite competitive with main-stream state-of-the-art codecs.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Technical Overview of VP9 \u2013 The Latest Open-Source Video Codec","publicationTitle":"SMPTE 2013 Annual Technical Conference & Exhibition","doi":"10.5594/M001518","displayPublicationTitle":"SMPTE 2013 Annual Technical Conference & Exhibition","pdfPath":"/iel7/7269393/7269394/07269424.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"17","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.5594/M001518","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7269394","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7269424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"SMPTE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7269424/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 Oct. 2013","displayDocTitle":"A Technical Overview of VP9 \u2013 The Latest Open-Source Video Codec","conferenceDate":"22-24 Oct. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Technical Overview of VP9 \u2013 The Latest Open-Source Video Codec","confLoc":"Hollywood, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"10-5594_M001518.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05783S","chronDate":"22-24 Oct. 2013","isNumber":"7269394","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7269393","citationCount":"21","articleId":"7269424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"SMPTE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"}]
