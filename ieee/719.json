Therefore organisations leveraging the benefits of cloud computing are likely to observe improved company performance and organisational competitiveness. Despite the immense benefits that cloud computing brings to organisations, there are risks and fears associated with its implementation. Common risks stem from end-user fears of a perceived loss of control of their sensitive data. Therein lies the core purpose of this paper: It provides a framework for managing cloud computing from an end-user environment perspective. Research was conducted and empirical data collected from a sample of active players in cloud computing in South Africa. The analysis of the results provided a basis for developing a conceptual framework for cloud-computing management and focussed on the end-users. This framework presents an innovative technique that implements publicly acceptable standards, policies and procedures as well as management controls.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IST-Africa Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179122/7190513/07190555.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"2015 IST-Africa Conference","doi":"10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2015.7190555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISTAFRICA.2015.7190555","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7190513","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7190555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A conceptual framework for cloud-computing management: An end-user environment perspective","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cloud computing","Computational modeling","Standards","Industries","Companies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conceptual framework","cloud computing management","end-user environment perspective","cloud computing flexibility","cloud computing scalability","capital expenditure reduction","company performance","organisational competitiveness","South Africa"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","end-user support","IT management","mitigation strategies"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7190555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A conceptual framework for cloud-computing management: An end-user environment perspective","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7190555/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15366881","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"6-8 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A conceptual framework for cloud-computing management: An end-user environment perspective","confLoc":"Lilongwe, Malawi","sourcePdf":"ISTAfrica2015PaperRef138IEEEXploreIS.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081587S","chronDate":"6-8 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179122","isNumber":"7190513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179122","xplore-issue":"7190513","articleId":"7190555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IIMC International Information Management Corporation Ltd.","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7192599,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed E.

The use of short pulses poses several problems as a result of group velocity dispersion (GVD), intersymbol interference (ISI) (due to avalanche photodiode (APD) buildup time), and receivers limited bandwidth. In this paper, an OCDM system employing code-shift keying (CSK) and overlapping pulse-position modulation (OPPM) signaling is proposed and theoretically investigated. By using CSK while maintaining same data rate, the chip duration can be increased to counteract the GVD effect in 2D OCDM systems. Moreover, by increasing the chip duration, the chip rate is decreased and the stringent requirement on receiver bandwidth is relaxed. In addition, using overlapping property in OPPM allows for further chip duration increase. We consider using correlation receivers with hard-limiters and APDs at the receiver side. The bit error probability (BEP) of the proposed system is derived taking into account the impacts of APD noise, thermal noise, GVD, ISI, and multiple-access interference (MAI). A performance comparison between OOK-, PPM-, OPPM-OCDM and the proposed system is carried out. Our results reveal that the use of CSK/OPPM-OCDM with data rate constraint allows the reduction of MAI, GVD and ISI effects with improved spectral efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192599/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","volume":"63","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"15524633","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192599/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optical Code-Division Multiplexing (OCDM) Networks Adopting Code-Shift Keying/Overlapping PPM Signaling: Proposal and Performance Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Egyptian Ministry of Higher Education"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Code-Division Multiplexing (OCDM) Networks Adopting Code-Shift Keying/Overlapping PPM Signaling: Proposal and Performance Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcomm-farghal-2467372-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103499S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7192599","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7192600,"authors":[{"name":"Wan Jun Melissa Chua","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wan Jun Melissa","lastName":"Chua","id":"37085742466"},{"name":"Kui Cai","affiliation":["Cluster of Science, Singapore University of Technology and Design, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kui","lastName":"Cai","id":"37391393000"},{"name":"Wang Ling Goh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wang Ling","lastName":"Goh","id":"37282097000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"7192600","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":174},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear codes","Hamming distance","Decoding","Nonvolatile memory","Complexity theory","Parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two write WOM codes","nonvolatile memories","write once memory","binary WOM-codes critical criterion"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Write-once memories","phase change memories","non-volatile memories"]},{"kwd":["Write-once memories","phase change memories","non-volatile memories"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192600","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/7294672/07192600.pdf","startPage":"1690","endPage":"1693","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2467327","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2015.2467327","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7294672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Two-Write WOM-Codes for Non-Volatile Memories","abstract":"A write once memory (WOM) is defined as a class of storage medium, with each storage element known as a cell, that contains information. In the context of a WOM, there is an added constraint whereby the cells can only move irreversibly from a lower state to a higher state. One of the major challenges faced by non-volatile memories (NVM) is the limited number of erasure operations allowed before a cell is deemed as unreliable. In this letter, we propose a critical criterion to design binary WOM-codes with coding efficiencies higher than the state of the art codes. We further propose high-rate non-binary WOM-codes which are constructed based on these efficient binary WOM-codes. We show that the WOM-codes designed using the proposed criterion achieves a coding efficiency improvement of 2% for the binary codes and 0.2% for the non-binary codes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192600/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","volume":"19","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15520393","dateOfInsertion":"08 October 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7192600/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Two-Write WOM-Codes for Non-Volatile Memories","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Two-Write WOM-Codes for Non-Volatile Memories","sourcePdf":"lcomm-chua-2467327-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093336S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4234","isNumber":"7294672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4234","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7294672","articleId":"7192600","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-04"},{"_id":7192613,"authors":[{"name":"Bradley J.

Many control signals for state-of-the-art BCIs involve imagining the movement of body parts that have little to do with the output command, revealing a cognitive disconnection between the user's intent and the action of the end effector. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques that can identify with high spatial resolution the self-modulated neural activity reflective of the actions of a helpful output device. Methods: We extend previous EEG source imaging (ESI) work to decoding natural hand/wrist manipulations by applying a novel technique to classifying four complex motor imaginations of the right hand: flexion, extension, supination, and pronation. Results: We report an increase of up to 18.6% for individual task classification and 12.7% for overall classification using the proposed ESI approach over the traditional sensor-based method. Conclusion: ESI is able to enhance BCI performance of decoding complex right-hand motor imagery tasks. Significance: This study may lead to the development of BCI systems with naturalistic and intuitive motor imaginations, thus facilitating broad use of noninvasive BCIs.","doi":"10.1109/TBME.2015.2467312","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/10/7360844/07192613.pdf","startPage":"4","endPage":"14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2015.2467312","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7360844","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"EEG Source Imaging Enhances the Decoding of Complex Right-Hand Motor Imagery Tasks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192613/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","displayDocTitle":"EEG Source Imaging Enhances the Decoding of Complex Right-Hand Motor Imagery Tasks","volume":"63","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15669069","pubMedId":"26276986","htmlLink":"/document/7192613/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CBET-1264782 and IGERT DGE-1069104"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health","grantNumber":"R01 EB00643"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"EEG Source Imaging Enhances the Decoding of Complex Right-Hand Motor Imagery Tasks","sourcePdf":"tbme-he-2467312-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151941S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"7360844","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"164","xplore-issue":"7360844","articleId":"7192613","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7192620,"authors":[{"name":"Daesung Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7299336/7192620/kim-2467384_print-small.gif","p":["\nDaesung Kim (SM'12) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Dajeon, Korea, in 2011.

Powerful systems have been built to support various types of bibliographic analysis, but they require some training and cannot be used to disseminate the insights gained. In contrast, we focused on developing a more accessible visual analytics system, called SurVis, that is ready to disseminate a carefully surveyed literature collection. The authors of a survey may use our Web-based system to structure and analyze their literature database. Later, readers of the survey can obtain an overview, quickly retrieve specific publications, and reproduce or extend the original bibliographic analysis. Our system employs a set of selectors that enable users to filter and browse the literature collection as well as to control interactive visualizations. The versatile selector concept includes selectors for textual search, filtering by keywords and meta-information, selection and clustering of similar publications, and following citation links.

The effects of nanomaterial doping and tunnel oxide thickness on cell characteristics are modeled. Similar to bulk emitters, cell efficiency could be increased by chemical doping (p-type) of the nanomaterial. Unlike bulk, nanomaterial could get electrostatically doped (n-type) due to its low quantum capacitance, by the surface charge density in silicon.

A moderate p-type chemical doping (0.2 eV shift in Fermi level) of graphene reduces the aforementioned loss to ~2%. The electrostatic doping effect in carbon nanotube-based cells is relatively small and independent to nanotube's chemical doping. For tunnel oxide thickness \u22652 nm, photogenerated carrier accumulation at silicon/oxide interface considerably enhances the electrostatic doping effect. The effect of tunnel oxide thickness variation on fill factor and open circuit voltage is shown to be qualitatively similar to standard bulk metal- insulator-silicon solar cells.

More specifically, the interactions between a user and a smart jammer regarding their respective choices of transmit power are formulated as a game under the assumption that the end-user decision making under uncertainty does not follow the traditional objective assumptions stipulated by expected utility theory, but rather follows the subjective deviations specified by PT. Two PT-based static jamming games are formulated to describe how subjective SU and jammer choose their transmit power to maximize their individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)-based utilities under uncertainties regarding the opponent's actions and channel states, respectively. The Nash equilibria of the games are presented under various channel models and transmission costs. Moreover, a PT-based dynamic jamming game is presented to investigate the long-term interactions between a subjective and a smart jammer according to a Markov decision process with uncertainty on the SU's future actions and the channel variations. Simulation results show that the subjective view of an SU tends to exaggerate the jamming probabilities and decreases its transmission probability, thus reducing the average SINR. On the other hand, the subjectivity of a jammer tends to reduce its jamming probability, and thus increases the SU throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2015.2467593","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/7277179/07192640.pdf","startPage":"2578","endPage":"2590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2015.2467593","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7277179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"User-Centric View of Jamming Games in Cognitive Radio Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192640","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192640/","displayDocTitle":"User-Centric View of Jamming Games in Cognitive Radio Networks","volume":"10","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15475104","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192640/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61271242"},{"fundingName":"U.

The algorithm was implemented in both cases using a training/validation/testing scheme in order to avoid overfitting problems. For the case of the FPGA implementation, a new neuron representation that reduces drastically the resource usage was introduced by combining the input and first hidden layer units in a single module. Further, a time-division multiplexing scheme was implemented for carrying out product computations taking advantage of the built-in digital signal processor cores. In both implementations, the floating-point data type representation normally used in a personal computer (PC) has been changed to a more efficient one based on a fixed-point scheme, reducing system memory variable usage and leading to an increase in computation speed. The results show that the modifications proposed produced a clear increase in computation speed in comparison with the standard PC-based implementation, demonstrating the usefulness of the intrinsic parallelism of FPGAs in neurocomputational tasks and the suitability of both implementations of the algorithm for its application to the real world problems.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Field programmable gate arrays","Training","Computer architecture","Boards","Digital signal processing","Signal processing algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","fixed point arithmetic","floating point arithmetic","microcontrollers","neural chips","time division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microcontrollers","backpropagation learning algorithm","field-programmable gate array","FPGA board","resource usage","computational speed","training/validation/testing scheme","neuron representation","time-division multiplexing scheme","product computations","built-in digital signal processor cores","floating-point data type representation","personal computer","fixed-point scheme","system memory variable usage"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Embedded systems","field-programmable gate array (FPGA)","hardware implementation","microcontrollers","supervised learning"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192642","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2460991","startPage":"1840","endPage":"1850","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7543555/07192642.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7543555","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2460991","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192642/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Implementation of the Backpropagation Algorithm in FPGAs and Microcontrollers","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","volume":"27","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16231710","pubMedId":"26277004","htmlLink":"/document/7192642/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002878","fundingName":"Consejer\u00eda de Econom\u00eda, Innovaci\u00f3n, Ciencia y Empleo, Junta de Andaluc\u00eda","grantNumber":"P08-TIC-04026 and P10-TIC-5770"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003329","fundingName":"Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad through the Spanish National Science Foundation including European Fund for Regional Development","grantNumber":"TIN2010-16556"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Implementation of the Backpropagation Algorithm in FPGAs and Microcontrollers","sourcePdf":"tnnls-franco-2460991-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107008S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7543555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7543555","articleId":"7192642","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":7192643,"authors":[{"name":"Amin Abdel Khalek","affiliation":["Wireless Networking & Communications Group, UT Austin WNCG, Austin, Texas, United States"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/7268793/7192643/7192643-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Amin Abdel Khalek (S\u201911\u2013M\u201913) received the B.E. degree in computer and communication engineering (with highest distinction) from Notre Dame University, Notre Dame, IN, USA, in 2008, the M.E. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, in 2013.","He was a member of the Wireless Networking and Communications Group, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA, from 2010 to 2013.

In this paper, we introduce an architecture for real-time video transmission over multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems using loss visibility side information . We quantify the perceptual importance of a packet through the packet loss visibility and use the loss visibility distribution to provide a notion of relative packet importance . To jointly achieve high video quality and low latency, we define the optimization objective function as the throughput weighted by the loss visibility of each packet, a proxy for the total perceptual value of successful packets per unit of time. We solve the problem of mapping video packets to MIMO subchannels and adapting per-stream rates to maximize the proposed objective . We show that the solution enables jointly reaping gains in terms of improved video quality and lower latency. Optimized packet-stream mapping enables transmission of more relevant packets over more reliable streams while unequal modulation opportunistically increases the transmission rate on the stronger streams to enable low latency delivery of high priority packets. Tested on H.264-encoded video sequences, for a 4 \u00d74 MIMO system with three spatial streams, the proposed architecture achieves 8 dB power reduction for the same video quality and supports 2.4\u00d7 higher throughput due to unequal modulation. Furthermore, the gains are achieved at the expense of few bits of cross-layer overhead rather than a complex cross-layer design.","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2015.2468196","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel7/6046/7268793/07192643.pdf","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2015.2468196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7268793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Loss Visibility Optimized Real-Time Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192643/","displayDocTitle":"Loss Visibility Optimized Real-Time Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems","volume":"17","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456881","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192643/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100002418-10.13039/100004351","fundingName":"Intel-Cisco"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Loss Visibility Optimized Real-Time Video Transmission Over MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tmm-abdelkhalek-2468196-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13031S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"7268793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7268793","articleId":"7192643","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7192644,"authors":[{"name":"Kai Li","affiliation":["Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7464742/7192644/li-2467381-small.gif","p":["Kai Li received the BE degree from Shandong University, China, in\n 2009, the MSc degree from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, in 2010, and the PhD degree\n in computer science from The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia, in 2014.

However, lossy airborne channels and limited battery of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are critical issues, adversely affecting success rate and network lifetime, especially in real-time applications. We propose an energy-efficient cooperative relaying scheme which extends network lifetime while guaranteeing the success rate. The optimal transmission schedule of the UAVs is formulated to minimize the maximum (min-max) energy consumption under guaranteed bit error rates, and can be judiciously reformulated and solved using standard optimisation techniques. We also propose a computationally efficient suboptimal algorithm to reduce the scheduling complexity, where energy balancing and rate adaptation are decoupled and carried out in a recursive alternating manner. Simulation results confirm that the suboptimal algorithm cuts off the complexity by orders of magnitude with marginal loss of the optimal network yield (throughput) and lifetime. The proposed suboptimal algorithm can also save energy by 50 percent, increase network yield by 15 percent, and extend network lifetime by 33 percent, compared to the prior art.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2467381","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7464742/07192644.pdf","startPage":"1377","endPage":"1386","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7464742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2467381","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Relaying for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192644","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2016","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Relaying for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192644/","publicationDate":"1 June 2016","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"16023176","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192644/","volume":"15","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000923","fundingName":"Australian Research Council","grantNumber":"DP110104344"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Cooperative Relaying for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tmc-li-2467381-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.153412S","chronDate":"June 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7464742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"111","xplore-issue":"7464742","articleId":"7192644","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7192646,"authors":[{"name":"Michelle A.

This allowed us to determine what components of a visualization attract people's attention, and what information is encoded into memory. Our findings quantitatively support many conventional qualitative design guidelines, including that (1) titles and supporting text should convey the message of a visualization, (2) if used appropriately, pictograms do not interfere with understanding and can improve recognition, and (3) redundancy helps effectively communicate the message. Importantly, we show that visualizations memorable \u201cat-a-glance\u201d are also capable of effectively conveying the message of the visualization. Thus, a memorable visualization is often also an effective one.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192646/","volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7192646/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15567966","isJournal":true,"pubMedId":"26390488","publicationDate":"31 Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Beyond Memorability: Visualization Recognition and Recall","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation"},{"fundingName":"NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program and a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"},{"fundingName":"NSERC Postgraduate Doctoral Scholarship (NSERC PGS-D)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004093","fundingName":"Kwanjeong Educational Foundation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beyond Memorability: Visualization Recognition and Recall","sourcePdf":"22tvcg01-bylinskii-2467732-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.223657S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"7307919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"7307919","articleId":"7192646","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7192647,"authors":[{"name":"Ronghu Chi","affiliation":["School of Automation and Electronic Engineering, Qingdao University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7299729/7192647/chi-2461022-small.gif","p":["Ronghu Chi received the Ph.D. degree from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, in 2007.","He was a Visiting Scholar with Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, and the University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.

A dynamical linearization approach is first developed with iterative operation points to formulate the relationship of system output and input into a linear affine form. Then, an ILC law is constructed with a nonlinear learning gain, which is a function about the system partial derivative with respect to the time-varying control input. In addition, a parameter updating law is designed to estimate the unknown partial derivatives iteratively. The input signals of the proposed E-DDOTILC are time-varying and updated utilizing not only the terminal tracking error of the previous run but also the input signals of the previous time instants in the current iteration. The proposed approach is a data-driven control strategy and only the I/O data are required for the controller design and analysis. The monotonic convergence and effectiveness of the proposed approach is further verified by both the rigorous mathematical analysis and the simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2461022","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2461022","startPage":"2939","endPage":"2948","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7299729/07192647.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Data-Driven Optimal Terminal ILC Using Current Iteration Control Knowledge","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Data-Driven Optimal Terminal ILC Using Current Iteration Control Knowledge","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"26","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192647/","accessionNumber":"15524675","pubMedId":"26277006","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192647/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374102 and 61120106009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Data-Driven Optimal Terminal ILC Using Current Iteration Control Knowledge","sourcePdf":"tnnls-chi-2461022-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070476S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7299729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7299729","articleId":"7192647","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7192655,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-Wei Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, College of Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6979/7330243/7192655/liang-2459917-small.gif","p":["\n\nChung-Wei Liang received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan, in 2002 and the M.S. degree in computer science and information engineering from Chaoyang University of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan, in 2004.

Pedestrians, cars, motorcycles, and bicycles are classified based on their side views from a fixed camera. A moving object is segmented and tracked using background subtraction, silhouette projection, an area ratio, a Kalman filter, and appearance correlation operations. For the classification of a segmented object, a combination of static and spatiotemporal features based on the cooccurrence of its appearance and the movements of its local parts is proposed. To extract the static appearance features, adaptive block-based gradient intensities and histograms of oriented gradients are proposed. For the spatiotemporal features, the optical-flow-based entropy values of instantaneous and short-term movements are proposed. The former finds the spatial entropy values of the orientations and the amplitudes of optical flows in a block to extract the local movement information from two consecutive image frames. The latter finds the temporal entropy values of the tracked optical flows in different orientation bins to extract the short-term movement information from several consecutive frames. Linear support vector machines with batch incremental learning are proposed to classify the four classes of objects. Experimental results from 12 test video sequences and comparisons with several feature descriptors show the effect of the proposed classification system and the advantage of the proposed features in classification.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6979/7330243/07192655.pdf","startPage":"3453","endPage":"3464","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","doi":"10.1109/TITS.2015.2459917","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2015.2459917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7330243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192655","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Moving Object Classification Using a Combination of Static Appearance Features and Spatial and Temporal Entropy Values of Optical Flows","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Histograms","Object segmentation","Spatiotemporal phenomena","Support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","bicycles","feature extraction","image classification","image filtering","image motion analysis","image sequences","intelligent transportation systems","Kalman filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","motorcycles","object detection","object tracking","pedestrians","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["moving object classification","spatial entropy values","temporal entropy values","intelligent transportation system","pedestrians","cars","motorcycles","bicycles","fixed camera","moving object segmentation","object tracking","background subtraction","silhouette projection","area ratio","Kalman filter","appearance correlation operation","spatiotemporal features","static appearance feature extraction","adaptive block-based gradient intensity","histogram of oriented gradients","optical-flow-based entropy value","instantaneous movements","short-term movements","local movement information extraction","consecutive image frames","linear support vector machines","batch incremental learning","video sequences","feature descriptors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Moving object segmentation","pedestrian detection","car detection","multi-class object classification","spatio-temporal features","support vector machines"]},{"kwd":["Moving object segmentation","pedestrian detection","car detection","multi-class object classification","spatio-temporal features","support vector machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192655/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Moving Object Classification Using a Combination of Static Appearance Features and Spatial and Temporal Entropy Values of Optical Flows","volume":"16","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7192655/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15618548","dateOfInsertion":"24 November 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007225","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"MOST 104-2221-E-005-039-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Moving Object Classification Using a Combination of Static Appearance Features and Spatial and Temporal Entropy Values of Optical Flows","sourcePdf":"tits-juang-2459917-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.148149S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6979","isNumber":"7330243","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6979","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7330243","articleId":"7192655","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7192657,"authors":[{"name":"Francesco Guidi","affiliation":["DEI, University of Bologna, Via Venezia 52, Cesena, Italy","CEA, LETI, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7464742/7192657/guidi-2467373-small.gif","p":["Francesco Guidi (S'09 - M'14) received the BS degree and\n the MS degree (both summa cum laude) from the University of Bologna in biomedical in 2006 and in electronics and\n telecommunications engineering in 2009, respectively.

Within this context, in this paper we put forth the concept of a personal mobile radar operating at millimeter-waves and consisting of a massive array for accurate environmental mapping. Frequency selectivity and phase quantization effects are accounted for to characterize the achievable angle and range resolution necessary to collect environmental information. Successively, we propose an effective grid-based Bayesian mapping approach by introducing a new state-space model, which profits of the beneficial effects of the massive antenna array characteristics. Numerical results show that the idea herein investigated is feasible, and that a significant mapping performance is attainable even employing coarse antenna arrays provided that the number of antenna elements is sufficiently high.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2015.2467373","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7464742/07192657.pdf","startPage":"1471","endPage":"1484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2015.2467373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7464742","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Personal Mobile Radars with Millimeter-Wave Massive Arrays for Indoor Mapping","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192657/","displayDocTitle":"Personal Mobile Radars with Millimeter-Wave Massive Arrays for Indoor Mapping","volume":"15","issue":"6","publicationDate":"1 June 2016","accessionNumber":"16034136","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192657/","dateOfInsertion":"04 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Italian Ministerial PRIN project GRETA","grantNumber":"2010WHY5PR"},{"fundingName":"MAPS","grantNumber":"659067"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Personal Mobile Radars with Millimeter-Wave Massive Arrays for Indoor Mapping","sourcePdf":"tmc-guidi-2467373-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149468S","chronDate":"June 1 2016","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7464742","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7464742","articleId":"7192657","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7192665,"authors":[{"name":"Josua Krause","affiliation":["NYU"],"firstName":"Josua","lastName":"Krause","id":"37085594931"},{"name":"Adam Perer","affiliation":["IBM T.J.

However, extracting cohorts from databases is a difficult yet important step, often overlooked in many analytical solutions. This is especially true when researchers wish to restrict their cohorts to exhibit a particular temporal pattern of interest. In order to fill this gap, we designed COQUITO, a visual interface that assists users defining cohorts with temporal constraints. COQUITO was designed to be comprehensible to domain experts with no preknowledge of database queries and also to encourage exploration. We then demonstrate the utility of COQUITO via two case studies, involving medical and social media researchers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer

we exemplify how information visualization supports speculative thinking, hypotheses testing, and preliminary interpretation processes as part of literary research. While InfoVis has become a buzz topic in the digital humanities, skepticism remains about how effectively it integrates into and expands on traditional humanities research approaches. From an InfoVis perspective, we lack case studies that show the specific design challenges that make literary studies and humanities research at large a unique application area for information visualization. We examine these questions through our case study of the Speculative W@nderverse, a visualization tool that was designed to enable the analysis and exploration of an untapped literary collection consisting of thousands of science fiction short stories. We present the results of two empirical studies that involved general-interest readers and literary scholars who used the evolving visualization prototype as part of their research for over a year. Our findings suggest a design space for visualizing literary collections that is defined by (1) their academic and public relevance, (2) the tension between qualitative vs. quantitative methods of interpretation, (3) result-vs. process-driven approaches to InfoVis, and (4) the unique material and visual qualities of cultural collections. Through the Speculative W@nderverse we demonstrate how visualization can bridge these sometimes contradictory perspectives by cultivating curiosity and providing entry points into literary collections while, at the same time, supporting multiple aspects of humanities research processes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"31 Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15567976","htmlLink":"/document/7192666/","pubMedId":"26529713","displayDocTitle":"Speculative Practices: Utilizing InfoVis to Explore Untapped Literary Collections","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speculative Practices: Utilizing InfoVis to Explore Untapped Literary Collections","sourcePdf":"22tvcg01-hinrichs-2467452-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081495S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"7307919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7307919","articleId":"7192666","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7192669,"authors":[{"name":"Johanna Fulda","affiliation":["University of Munich (LMU)","University of British Columbia"],"firstName":"Johanna","lastName":"Fulda","id":"37085608094"},{"name":"Matthew Brehmer","affiliation":["University of British Columbia"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Brehmer","id":"37085607822"},{"name":"Tamara Munzner","affiliation":["University of British Columbia"],"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Munzner","id":"37349490300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"7192669","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1626},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Data visualization","Data mining","Manuals","Natural language processing","Pipelines","Context"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authoring systems","data visualisation","interactive systems","natural language processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TimeLineCurator","interactive authoring","visual timelines","browser-based authoring tool","event data extraction","temporal references","unstructured text documents","natural language processing","timeline creation process","temporal stories","event data formatting","events distribution","timeline material","events curating","events editing","entity extraction error","timeline curation process","user experience","timeline authoring","journalism"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["System","timelines","authoring environment","time-oriented data","journalism"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Graphics","Data Mining","Humans","Journalism","Time Factors","User-Computer Interface"]},{"kwd":["System","timelines","authoring environment","time-oriented data","journalism"]}],"abstract":"We present TimeLineCurator, a browser-based authoring tool that automatically extracts event data from temporal references in unstructured text documents using natural language processing and encodes them along a visual timeline. Our goal is to facilitate the timeline creation process for journalists and others who tell temporal stories online. Current solutions involve manually extracting and formatting event data from source documents, a process that tends to be tedious and error prone. With TimeLineCurator, a prospective timeline author can quickly identify the extent of time encompassed by a document, as well as the distribution of events occurring along this timeline. Authors can speculatively browse possible documents to quickly determine whether they are appropriate sources of timeline material. TimeLineCurator provides controls for curating and editing events on a timeline, the ability to combine timelines from multiple source documents, and export curated timelines for online deployment. We evaluate TimeLineCurator through a benchmark comparison of entity extraction error against a manual timeline curation process, a preliminary evaluation of the user experience of timeline authoring, a brief qualitative analysis of its visual output, and a discussion of prospective use cases suggested by members of the target author communities following its deployment.","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467531","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/7307919/07192669.pdf","startPage":"300","endPage":"309","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TimeLineCurator: Interactive Authoring of Visual Timelines from Unstructured Text","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192669","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192669/","displayDocTitle":"TimeLineCurator: Interactive Authoring of Visual Timelines from Unstructured Text","volume":"22","issue":"1","publicationDate":"31 Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15567979","pubMedId":"26529709","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192669/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TimeLineCurator: Interactive Authoring of Visual Timelines from Unstructured Text","sourcePdf":"22tvcg01-fulda-2467531-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100379S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"7307919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"7307919","articleId":"7192669","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7192671,"authors":[{"name":"Hannah Kim","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Hannah","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085351744"},{"name":"Jaegul Choo","affiliation":["Korea University"],"firstName":"Jaegul","lastName":"Choo","id":"37602784600"},{"name":"Haesun Park","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Haesun","lastName":"Park","id":"37277119500"},{"name":"Alex Endert","affiliation":["Georgia Institute of Technology"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"Endert","id":"37681759500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"7192671","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":47,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1096},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Visual analytics","Principal component analysis","Semantics","Scalability","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["InterAxis","steering scatterplot axes","observation-level interaction","data visualization","data attribute","Cartesian coordinates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Scatterplots","user interaction","model steering"]},{"kwd":["Scatterplots","user interaction","model steering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/7307919/07192671.pdf","startPage":"131","endPage":"140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192671","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"InterAxis: Steering Scatterplot Axes via Observation-Level Interaction","abstract":"Scatterplots are effective visualization techniques for multidimensional data that use two (or three) axes to visualize data items as a point at its corresponding x and y Cartesian coordinates. Typically, each axis is bound to a single data attribute. Interactive exploration occurs by changing the data attributes bound to each of these axes. In the case of using scatterplots to visualize the outputs of dimension reduction techniques, the x and y axes are combinations of the true, high-dimensional data. For these spatializations, the axes present usability challenges in terms of interpretability and interactivity. That is, understanding the axes and interacting with them to make adjustments can be challenging. In this paper, we present InterAxis, a visual analytics technique to properly interpret, define, and change an axis in a user-driven manner. Users are given the ability to define and modify axes by dragging data items to either side of the x or y axes, from which the system computes a linear combination of data attributes and binds it to the axis. Further, users can directly tune the positive and negative contribution to these complex axes by using the visualization of data attributes that correspond to each axis. We describe the details of our technique and demonstrate the intended usage through two scenarios.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192671/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","publicationDate":"31 Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15567981","pubMedId":"26357399","htmlLink":"/document/7192671/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"InterAxis: Steering Scatterplot Axes via Observation-Level Interaction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"DARPA XDATA","grantNumber":"FA8750-12-2-0309"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-0808863"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"InterAxis: Steering Scatterplot Axes via Observation-Level Interaction","sourcePdf":"22tvcg01-kim-2467615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068557S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"7307919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"7307919","articleId":"7192671","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7192685,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Heimerl","affiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Heimerl","id":"38490630000"},{"name":"Qi Han","affiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Qi","lastName":"Han","id":"37085447519"},{"name":"Steffen Koch","affiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Koch","id":"37593029700"},{"name":"Thomas Ertl","affiliation":["Institute for Visualization and Interactive Systems (VIS), University of Stuttgart"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ertl","id":"37268023800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"7192685","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":45,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1999},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192685","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visualization","Market research","Metadata","Tag clouds","Data mining","Color","Joining processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["citation analysis","data visualisation","document handling","scientific information systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CiteRivers","visual analytics","citation patterns","scientific literature collections exploration","scientific literature collections analysis","knowledge management","document sets","textual content","document metadata","citation analysis","structure visualization","citation networks","interactive visual analysis","scientific documents","user-steered aggregation","citing publications","interactive visualization approach","dataset exploration","expert user feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["scientific literature","visual document analysis","visual citation analysis","streamgraph","clustering"]},{"kwd":["scientific literature","visual document analysis","visual citation analysis","streamgraph","clustering"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467621","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/7307919/07192685.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"199","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CiteRivers: Visual Analytics of Citation Patterns","abstract":"The exploration and analysis of scientific literature collections is an important task for effective knowledge management. Past interest in such document sets has spurred the development of numerous visualization approaches for their interactive analysis.

Previously presented approaches for citation analysis aim primarily at the visualization of the structure of citation networks and their exploration. We extend the state-of-the-art by presenting an approach for the interactive visual analysis of the contents of scientific documents, and combine it with a new and flexible technique to analyze their citations. This technique facilitates user-steered aggregation of citations which are linked to the content of the citing publications using a highly interactive visualization approach. Through enriching the approach with additional interactive views of other important aspects of the data, we support the exploration of the dataset over time and enable users to analyze citation patterns, spot trends, and track long-term developments.

By providing both rich text and movement information, visual analysis on social media data can be both interesting and challenging. In contrast to traditional movement data, the sparseness and irregularity of social media data increase the difficulty of extracting movement patterns. To facilitate the understanding of people's movements, we present an interactive visual analytics system to support the exploration of sparsely sampled trajectory data from social media. We propose a heuristic model to reduce the uncertainty caused by the nature of social media data. In the proposed system, users can filter and select reliable data from each derived movement category, based on the guidance of uncertainty model and interactive selection tools. By iteratively analyzing filtered movements, users can explore the semantics of movements, including the transportation methods, frequent visiting sequences and keyword descriptions. We provide two cases to demonstrate how our system can help users to explore the movement patterns.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192688/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7192688/","dateOfInsertion":"28 October 2015","publicationDate":"31 Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15567997","pubMedId":"26340781","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Interactive Visual Discovering of Movement Patterns from Sparsely Sampled Geo-tagged Social Media Data","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"NSFC","grantNumber":"61170204"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Key","grantNumber":"61232012"},{"fundingName":"National Program on Key Basic Research Project"},{"fundingName":"PKU-Qihu Joint Data Visual Analytics Research Center"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interactive Visual Discovering of Movement Patterns from Sparsely Sampled Geo-tagged Social Media Data","sourcePdf":"22tvcg01-chen-2467619-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094268S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"7307919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"7307919","articleId":"7192688","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":7192690,"authors":[{"name":"Steve Kieffer","affiliation":["Monash University and NICTA Victoria"],"firstName":"Steve","lastName":"Kieffer","id":"37085607255"},{"name":"Tim Dwyer","affiliation":["Monash University"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Dwyer","id":"37326161000"},{"name":"Kim Marriott","affiliation":["Monash University and NICTA Victoria"],"firstName":"Kim","lastName":"Marriott","id":"37354163600"},{"name":"Michael Wybrow","affiliation":["Monash University"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Wybrow","id":"37867777700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"7192690","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":40,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1433},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Algorithm design and analysis","Manuals","Standards","Software algorithms","Visualization","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","graph theory","human factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-centred methodology","higher-quality layout","multistage frameworks","automatic network layout algorithms","human-like orthogonal network layout","HOLA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Graph layout","orthogonal layout","automatic layout algorithms","user-generated layout","graph-drawing aesthetics"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computational Biology","Computer Graphics","Humans","User-Computer Interface"]},{"kwd":["Graph layout","orthogonal layout","automatic layout algorithms","user-generated layout","graph-drawing aesthetics"]}],"abstract":"Over the last 50 years a wide variety of automatic network layout algorithms have been developed.

We give a new \u201chuman-centred\u201d methodology for automatic network layout algorithm design that is intended to overcome this deficiency. User studies are first used to identify the aesthetic criteria algorithms should encode, then an algorithm is developed that is informed by these criteria and finally, a follow-up study evaluates the algorithm output.

These often introduce their own uncertainties, in addition to the ones inherent in the data, and these propagated and compounded uncertainties can result in impaired decision making. The user's confidence or trust in the results depends on the extent of user's awareness of the underlying uncertainties generated on the system side. This paper unpacks the uncertainties that propagate through visual analytics systems, illustrates how human's perceptual and cognitive biases influence the user's awareness of such uncertainties, and how this affects the user's trust building. The knowledge generation model for visual analytics is used to provide a terminology and framework to discuss the consequences of these aspects in knowledge construction and though examples, machine uncertainty is compared to human trust measures with provenance. Furthermore, guidelines for the design of uncertainty-aware systems are presented that can aid the user in better decision making.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/7307919/07192716.pdf","startPage":"240","endPage":"249","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307919","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192716","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Role of Uncertainty, Awareness, and Trust in Visual Analytics","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Data visualization","Visual analytics","Data models","Buildings","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data structures","data visualisation","decision making","uncertainty handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["visual analytics","analytical technique","visualisation technique","visual data representation","impaired decision making","knowledge generation model","knowledge construction","machine uncertainty","uncertainty-aware systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Visual Analytics","Knowledge Generation","Uncertainty Measures and Propagation","Trust Building","Human Factors"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Awareness","Computer Graphics","Human Engineering","Humans","Trust","Uncertainty"]},{"kwd":["Visual Analytics","Knowledge Generation","Uncertainty Measures and Propagation","Trust Building","Human Factors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192716/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"The Role of Uncertainty, Awareness, and Trust in Visual Analytics","volume":"22","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7192716/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"31 Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15568024","pubMedId":"26529704","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"EU project Visual Analytics for Sensemaking in Criminal Intelligence Analysis (VALCRI)","grantNumber":"FP7-SEC-2013-608142 and SPP 1335"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Role of Uncertainty, Awareness, and Trust in Visual Analytics","sourcePdf":"22tvcg01-sacha-2467591-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124861S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"7307919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"89","xplore-issue":"7307919","articleId":"7192716","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7192727,"authors":[{"name":"Imran Shafique Ansari","affiliation":["Computer, Electrical, and Mathematical Sciences and Engineering (CEMSE) Division, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7192727/ansar-2467386-small.gif","p":["Imran Shafique Ansari (S\u201907) was born in India in 1987.

Improvements to these pipeline techniques, especially for orthogonal-style layout, are difficult and practical results have been slight in recent years. Yet, as discussed in this paper, there remain significant issues in the quality of the layouts produced by these techniques, even for quite small networks. This is especially true when layout with additional grouping constraints is required. The first contribution of this paper is to investigate an ultra-compact, grid-like network layout aesthetic that is motivated by the grid arrangements that are used almost universally by designers in typographical layout. Since the time when these heuristic and pipeline-based graph-layout methods were conceived, generic technologies (MIP, CP and SAT) for solving combinatorial and mixed-integer optimization problems have improved massively. The second contribution of this paper is to reassess whether these techniques can be used for high-quality layout of small graphs. While they are fast enough for graphs of up to 50 nodes we found these methods do not scale up. Our third contribution is a large-neighborhood search meta-heuristic approach that is scalable to larger networks.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/7307919/07192733.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"348","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467251","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467251","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Quality Ultra-Compact Grid Layout of Grouped Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192733/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2016","displayDocTitle":"High-Quality Ultra-Compact Grid Layout of Grouped Networks","htmlLink":"/document/7192733/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"31 Jan. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","accessionNumber":"15568038","pubMedId":"26390477","isJournal":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council through Discovery Project","grantNumber":"DP140100077"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Quality Ultra-Compact Grid Layout of Grouped Networks","sourcePdf":"22tvcg01-yoghourdjian-2467251-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123371S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"7307919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7307919","articleId":"7192733","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7192736,"authors":[{"name":"Erik Ela","affiliation":["Electric Power Research Institute, Boulder, CO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Erik Ela (M\u201906\u2013SM\u201915) received the B.S.E.E degree from Binghamton University, Binghamton, NY, USA, the M.S. degree from the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA, and the Ph.D. degree from University College Dublin, Ireland.","He is currently a senior technical leader at the Electric Power Research Institute.

These resources increase the variability and uncertainty on the system which must be accommodated by an increase in the flexibility of the system resources in order to maintain reliability. Many scheduling strategies have been discussed and introduced to ensure that this flexibility is available at multiple timescales. To meet variability, that is, the expected changes in system conditions, two recent strategies have been introduced: time-coupled multi-period market clearing models and the incorporation of ramp capability constraints. To appropriately evaluate these methods, it is important to assess both efficiency and reliability. But it is also important to assess the incentive structure to ensure that resources asked to perform in different ways have the proper incentives to follow these directions, which is a step often ignored in simulation studies. We find that there are advantages and disadvantages to both approaches. We also find that look-ahead horizon length in multi-period market models can impact incentives. This paper proposes scheduling and pricing methods that ensure expected ramps are met reliably, efficiently, and with associated prices based on true marginal costs that incentivize resources to do as directed by the market. Case studies show improvements of the new method.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7453237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2461535","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7453237/07192736.pdf","startPage":"1681","endPage":"1691","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2461535","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling and Pricing for Expected Ramp Capability in Real-Time Power Markets","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/59/7453237/7192736-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2016","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling and Pricing for Expected Ramp Capability in Real-Time Power Markets","volume":"31","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7192736/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2016","accessionNumber":"15935213","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2016","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192736/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":""}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Scheduling and Pricing for Expected Ramp Capability in Real-Time Power Markets","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-ela-2461535-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133049S","chronDate":"May  2016","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7453237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7453237","articleId":"7192736","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7192741,"authors":[{"name":"Fabio Pareschi","affiliation":["Department of Engineering, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy","Advanced Research Center on Electronic Systems, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/7416019/7192741/7192741-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Fabio Pareschi (S\u201905\u2013M\u201908) received the Dr.Eng. degree (with honors) in electronic engineering from the University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy, and the Ph.D. degree in information technology under the European Doctorate Project (EDITH) from the University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy, in 2001 and 2007, respectively.","Currently, he is working as Assistant Professor in the Department of Engineering (ENDIF), University of Ferrara.

The system is realized in a CMOS 180 nm technology and targets the acquisition of bio-signals with Nyquist frequency up to 100 kHz. To maximize performance and reduce hardware complexity, we co-design hardware together with acquisition and reconstruction algorithms. The resulting AIC outperforms previously proposed solutions mainly thanks to two key features. First, we adopt a novel method to deal with saturations in the computation of CS measurements. This allows no loss in performance even when 60% of measurements saturate. Second, the system is able to adapt itself to the energy distribution of the input by exploiting the so-called rakeness to maximize the amount of information contained in the measurements.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2444276","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/7416019/07192741.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7416019","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2015.2444276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware-Algorithms Co-Design and Implementation of an Analog-to-Information Converter for Biosignals Based on Compressed Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192741","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Hardware-Algorithms Co-Design and Implementation of an Analog-to-Information Converter for Biosignals Based on Compressed Sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192741/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"25 February 2016","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15802431","pubMedId":"26276997","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192741/","volume":"10","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware-Algorithms Co-Design and Implementation of an Analog-to-Information Converter for Biosignals Based on Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tbcas-setti-2444276-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151501S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"7416019","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"7416019","articleId":"7192741","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7192743,"authors":[{"name":"Ana Paula Estrada-Vargas","affiliation":["CINVESTAV, Unidad Guadalajara, Zapopan, Mexico","LURPA, ENS Cachan, Univ Paris-Sud, Cachan, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7963895/7192743/7192743-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ana-Paula Estrada-Vargas received the B.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the Universidad de Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Mexico, in 2007, the M.Sc. degree from CINVESTAV, Guadalajara, Mexico, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree from both CINVESTAV in Guadalajara and the ENS de Cachan, Cachan, France, in 2013.","Currently, she is with the Oracle Semantic Technologies at the Mexico Development Center.

The behavior of the closed-loop system (PLC and Plant) is observed during its operation and is represented by a single long sequence of observed input/output (I/O) signals vectors. The proposed method follows a black-box and passive identification approach that allows addressing large and complex industrial DES and yields compact and expressive interpreted Petri net (IPN) models. It consists of two complementary stages; the first one obtains, from the I/O sequence, the reactive part of the model composed by observable places and transitions. The I/O sequence is also mapped into a sequence of the created transitions, from which the second stage builds the non observable part of the model including places that ensure the reproduction of the observed input output sequence. This method, based on polynomial-time algorithms on the size of the input data, has been implemented as a software tool that generates and draws the IPN model; it has been tested with input/output sequences obtained from real systems in operation. The tool is described and its application is illustrated through a case study.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Black-Box Identification Method for Automated Discrete-Event Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2015.2445332","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7963895/07192743.pdf","startPage":"1321","endPage":"1336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2015.2445332","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7963895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192743","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192743/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2017","displayDocTitle":"A Black-Box Identification Method for Automated Discrete-Event Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/7192743/","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2017","publicationDate":"July 2017","accessionNumber":"17012805","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Black-Box Identification Method for Automated Discrete-Event Systems","sourcePdf":"tase-lopezmellado-2445332-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093041S","chronDate":"July  2017","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7963895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7963895","articleId":"7192743","onlineDate":"12 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2017","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7192745,"authors":[{"name":"Mario Sako","affiliation":["Toshiba, Yokohama, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/7368951/7192745/7192745-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mario Sako was born in Gifu, Japan, in 1979.

For this reason, biometric templates are increasingly used for border monitoring, access control, membership verification, and so on. When employed to replace passwords, biometrics have the added advantage that they do not need to be memorized and are relatively hard to steal. Nonetheless, unlike conventional security mechanisms such as passwords, biometric data are inherent parts of a person?s body and cannot be replaced if they are compromised. Even worse, compromised biometric data can be used to have access to sensitive information and to impersonate the victim for malicious purposes. For the same reason, biometric leakage in a given system can seriously jeopardize the security of other systems based on the same biometrics. A further problem associated with the use of biometric traits is that, due to their uniqueness, the privacy of their owner is put at risk. Geographical position, movements, habits, and even personal beliefs can be tracked by observing when and where the biometric traits of an individual are used to identify him/her.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192837/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192837/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15364461","volume":"32","issue":"5","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Privacy Protection in Biometric-Based Recognition Systems: A marriage between cryptography and signal processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy Protection in Biometric-Based Recognition Systems: A marriage between cryptography and signal processing","sourcePdf":"32msp05-barni-2438131-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09212S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"7192809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7192809","articleId":"7192837","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-10"},{"_id":7192838,"authors":[{"name":"Vishal M.

With the rapid adaptation of biometric systems, there is a growing concern that biometric technologies may compromise the privacy and anonymity of individuals. Unlike credit cards and passwords, which can be revoked and reissued when compromised, biometrics are permanently associated with a user and cannot be replaced. To prevent the theft of biometric patterns, it is desirable to modify them through revocable and noninvertible transformations to produce cancelable biometric templates. In this article, we provide an overview of various cancelable biometric schemes for biometric template protection.

In case of multi-user MIMO, a multi-antenna transmitter communicates simultaneously with multiple receivers. But the MU-MIMO system suffers from huge inter-user interference. By using precoding techniques in massive MU-MIMO the inter-user interference of the system are analyzed and it can be substantially reduced. In precoding technique the transmit diversity is exploited by weighting information stream so that it reduces the corrupted effect in communication channel, for this purpose the CSI are needed to be known by the transmitter.

means. This emerging technology enables proactive energy replenishment of wireless networks. It is advantageous in supporting applications with quality of service. In this paper we propose a novel project Energy Harvesting (EH) simulation method for Cognitive Radio and Non Cognitive Radio (CR & NCR) networks using MATLAB. Harvesting energy can be done in secondary networks called secondary transmitter (ST), harvest wasted energy from nearby active transmitters in a primary network, called primary transmitter (PT). We consider all possible means in which PTs and STs are distributed as independent Homogeneous Poisson Point Process (HPPPs) and communicate with their intended receivers within specified distances. Each PT is associated with a guard zone to protect its intended receiver from ST's interference, and at the same time delivers energy to STs located in its harvesting zone. Based on the proposed model, we tend to analyze gain estimation and signal to noise ratio in allowed secondary users. Finally, we show the comparison of number of active secondary users is high in Cognitive Radio networks.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7192864","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174422/7192777/07192864.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7192777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7192864","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance measure and Energy Harvesting in cognitive and Non-Cognitive Radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Performance measure and Energy Harvesting in cognitive and Non-Cognitive Radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192864/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192864/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15380916","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-20 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance measure and Energy Harvesting in cognitive and Non-Cognitive Radio networks","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"117.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046409S","chronDate":"19-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174422","isNumber":"7192777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174422","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7192777","articleId":"7192864","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7192894,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It turned out because of the introduction of the concept of cloud computing. Basically Cloud computing is an internet based computing service. Cloud provides virtually everything as service and infrastructure provides resources as provision over the Internet and Storage cloud can give storage as a service. These services are utilized for storing and processing immensely colossal data set over Internet. Now a days, mobile phones are increasing day by day and it is becoming part of human life as most effective and convenient communication tool and it will not be bounded by the time and place. Information Technology plays an important role in educational sectors also. Due to the growth of educational institutions all over the world there is a requirement of developing cloud architecture which can help storing and processing large information produced by these institutions. The rapid growth of mobile applications and also emerging of cloud computing results in recommending mobile cloud computing for various services like health sectors (M-Health), commerce (M-commerce) ,gaming(M-Gaming) and education sectors(M-edu). Mobile Cloud computing can be a solution for storing the educational data into more systematic manner and it can be reached out easily to all kind of people in all regions. In this paper we proposed mobihybrid educloud , which is implemented with the combination of public cloud and private cloud concepts for educational institutions like universities. Mobile hybrid cloud adapting absolutely impacts the learning methodology from both teachers and learners. As a matter of fact every individual can not have access to systems.

However, there are inevitable problems that degrade the noise immunity of this family; they are the inevitable leakage current and the charge sharing. The proposed circuit technique decreases the parasitic capacitance on the dynamic node, yielding a smaller keeper for wide fan-in gates to implement fast and robust circuits. Thus, the contention current and consequently power consumption and delay are reduced. The leakage current is also decreased by exploiting the footer transistor in diode configuration. In this new domino transistor using 4-bit OR Gate with 8 transistor are used. Simulation is done by using Tanner tool. Post-layout simulation results in a 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology confirm the analysis results. It is shown that in the proposed current comparison based domino reduces both the leakage current and delay time.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Benchmark testing","Charge coupled devices","Indexes","Transistors","MOS devices","Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS logic circuits","integrated circuit noise","leakage currents","logic gates","power consumption"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Domino CMOS logic circuit family","noise immunity","leakage current","charge sharing","parasitic capacitance","dynamic node","fan-in gates","contention current","power consumption","footer transistor","diode configuration","domino transistor","4-bit OR Gate","Tanner tool","post-layout simulation","CMOS technology","delay time","clamped bit line sense amplifier","size 0.18 mum","word length 4 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Domino logic","leakage-tolerant","noise immunity","wide fan-in"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7192990","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174422/7192777/07192990.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7192777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7192990","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CCD Based New Domino Circuit Using Clamped bit line sense amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7192990","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"CCD Based New Domino Circuit Using Clamped bit line sense amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7192990/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7192990/","accessionNumber":"15380995","conferenceDate":"19-20 March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CCD Based New Domino Circuit Using Clamped bit line sense amplifier","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"230.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050269S","chronDate":"19-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174422","isNumber":"7192777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174422","xplore-issue":"7192777","articleId":"7192990","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7192998,"authors":[{"name":"D.

This paper introduces an implementation of one of the complex arithmetic operations, the Fused Add-Multiply (FAM) operation. In general, a separate adder and a multiplier are used to perform Add-Multiply operation. The use of separate adder and multiplier adds significant area and delay. So, an efficient Fused Add-Multiply Unit is implemented using the Radix-8 Modified Booth Recoder. The Modified Booth Recoder design is based on the redundant logic and Constant-time addition. Instead of deriving the adder output as in conventional methods, the recoder recodes the adder input directly to MB form thus decreasing delay. The multiplier unit uses the Radix-8 Modified Booth algorithm. The delay and the area of the redundant adder/recoder have been reduced by 2% and 57% respectively. In comparison with the conventional design, the overall delay of the FAM has been reduced by 15%. On analyzing the Radix-8 FAM unit, it has been observed that the newly modified design yields better performance in terms of area and delay.","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174422/7192777/07193052.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193052","doi":"10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7192777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"VLSI implementation of an efficient Fused Add-Multiply unit using Constant-time addition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"VLSI implementation of an efficient Fused Add-Multiply unit using Constant-time addition","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193052/","conferenceDate":"19-20 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7193052/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15366662","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 March 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"VLSI implementation of an efficient Fused Add-Multiply unit using Constant-time addition","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"287.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088118S","chronDate":"19-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174422","isNumber":"7192777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174422","xplore-issue":"7192777","articleId":"7193052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193072,"authors":[{"name":"Sripriya J","affiliation":["Department of Networking, Sri Manakula Vinayagar, Pondicherry"],"lastName":"Sripriya J","id":"37087529429"},{"name":"Ramalingam A","affiliation":["Department of MCA, Sri Manakula Vinayagar, Pondicherry"],"lastName":"Ramalingam A","id":"37087530082"},{"name":"Rajeswari K","affiliation":["Department of Networking, Sri Manakula Vinayagar, Pondicherry"],"lastName":"Rajeswari K","id":"37087530209"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6818-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6817-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6816-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7193072","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vehicles","Vehicle routing","Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Optimization","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","minimisation","Pareto optimisation","search problems","vehicle routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vehicle routing problem with time windows","VRPTW","specified time window","vehicle minimization","total distance travelled minimization","hybrid genetic search algorithm","diversity control","Pareto approach","crossover operator","relocation mutation operator","split mutation operator","VRPLIB"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows","Genetic Algorithm","Multiobjective"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193072","abstract":"The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) consists of a homogenous set of vehicles and a set of customer located in a city.

This will be helpful in the improvement of treatment process for the patients suffered due to bone diseases. The system for the design of bone strain requires the components which include sensors, amplifiers, analog to digital converters (ADC), filter and the processing unit. Whenever the bone is loaded, it creates a small adjustment in the bone mass. The measurement of bone strain system requires more accuracy because of this very minimum variation in the structure of bone mass. Strain gauge sensors are used to sense the change in interconnected plates of bone mass (strain). The strain is a minimum value and in the range of micros, it desires to be processed to get the original value of strain. The processing of the signal is easier if it is a digital signal when compared to analog signal. Hence the voltage signal from the sensor measuring the strain is transmitted. Then the transmitted signal is amplified through operational amplifier and the analog signal is converted to digital using the comparator circuit. These operational amplifier and comparator circuit are designed using Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology to reduce the power consumption and simulated with the help of Mentor graphics. The system takes long time to measure the strain so that the system power consumption should be low. Thus the analysis of strain is useful in the treatment of orthopedic diseases.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7192777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193104","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174422/7192777/07193104.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doi":"10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193104","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of operational amplifier, analog to digital converter for the measurement of bone strain using CMOS technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Design of operational amplifier, analog to digital converter for the measurement of bone strain using CMOS technology","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-20 March 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7193104/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15366650","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193104/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of operational amplifier, analog to digital converter for the measurement of bone strain using CMOS technology","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"334.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047581S","chronDate":"19-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174422","isNumber":"7192777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174422","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7192777","articleId":"7193104","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7193108,"authors":[{"name":"G.M.

The main reasons are the efficient implementation of carry propagate adders (CPAs) on these devices (due to their specialized carry-chain resources) as well as the area overhead of the redundant adders when they are implemented on FPGAs. This paper presents different approaches to the efficient implementation of generic carry-save compressor trees on FPGAs. We present a fast critical path, independent of bit width, with practically no area overhead compared to CPA trees. Along with the classic carry-save compressor tree, we present a novel linear array structure, which efficiently uses the fast carry-chain resources. This approach is defined in a parameterizable HDL code based on CPAs, which makes it compatible with any FPGA family or vendor. A detailed study is provided for a wide range of bit widths and large number of operands. Compared to binary and ternary CPA trees, speedups of up to 2.29 and 2.14 are achieved for 16-bit width and up to 3.81 and 3.11 for 64-bit width.","doi":"10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193108","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174422/7192777/07193108.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7192777","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of redundant carry save adders on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193108/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of redundant carry save adders on FPGA","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193108/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15366669","conferenceDate":"19-20 March 2015","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of redundant carry save adders on FPGA","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"338.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060372S","chronDate":"19-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174422","isNumber":"7192777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174422","xplore-issue":"7192777","articleId":"7193108","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193124,"authors":[{"name":"Mayur S.

Previously it is taken as the processors and jobs are having same priority but that is not actual case. So to improve the efficiency of GA the input processors are given first to the priority algorithm that is Logarithmic Least Square Matrix that is proposed here.

DCT requires large amount of mathematical computations including multiplications and accumulations. The multipliers consume increased power and area; hence multipliers are completely discarded in the proposed design. Distributed arithmetic is a method of modification at bit stream for sum of product or vector dot product to hide the multiplications. DA is very much suitable for FPGA designs as it reduces the size of a multiply and accumulate hardware. The speed is increased in the proposed design with the fully parallel approach.

The use of powerful kernel based learning is very practical in current trends may expose accurate results in real time database applications. In this context, we need to use the new and adorned machine learning classifiers. In this paper we have given very successful and emerged kernels SVM (Support Vector Machines) which uses the marginal hyperplane uniquely determine the classes by mapping of data and KPCA (Kernel Principal Component Analysis) is an extension to PCA. Both used to classify the data and detecting anomalies by transforming input space into high dimensional feature space. The SVM kernel is use non-linear mapping function and inner product replace with kernel ingredients. KPCA extract principal components from set of corresponding eigenvectors and used as threshold with reference to kernel width. The SVM and KPCA are implemented by taking one real-time bank dataset and other from UCI machine learning repository sets. Finally performance compared with non-kernel techniques (CART, k-NN, PLSDA, PCA) applied on same datasets using training and test set combinations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174422/7192777/07193182.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Innovations in Information, Embedded and Communication Systems (ICIIECS)","doi":"10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIECS.2015.7193182","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7192777","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel centric machine learning classifiers for anomaly detection with real bank datasets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Support vector machines","Principal component analysis","Feature extraction","Training","Conferences","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bank data processing","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification","principal component analysis","security of data","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel centric machine learning classifier","anomaly detection","bank dataset","support vector machine","SVM","kernel principal component analysis","KPCA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Anomaly detection","Kernel","KPCA","Machine learning","SVM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193182/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Kernel centric machine learning classifiers for anomaly detection with real bank datasets","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193182/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15366608","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"19-20 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel centric machine learning classifiers for anomaly detection with real bank datasets","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050185S","chronDate":"19-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174422","isNumber":"7192777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174422","xplore-issue":"7192777","articleId":"7193182","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193225,"authors":[{"name":"B.

An important aspect of spectrum management in CR systems is adaptation of the spectrum sensing methods employed by CRs in order to accurately detect the changing patterns of spectrum use and to update the spectrum and interference constraints under which CR terminals operate. The cognitive radio paradigm is based on the ability to detect the presence of primary users in a given frequency band. In this scenario a spectrum monitor may estimate the signal power levels of all frequency channels in the band of interest, together with the background noise level. We address Maximum Likelihood estimation for this problem, exploiting a priori knowledge about the primary network, summarized in the spectral shape of primary transmissions. An iterative asymptotic ML estimate is proposed, which can be further simplified in order obtain a computationally more an efficient Least Squares estimator with performance very close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound in several cases of interest.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193225/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-20 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15380956","htmlLink":"/document/7193225/","conferenceDate":"19-20 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Improved energy-efficient cooperative spectrum sensing schemes based on noise variance estimation for Cognitive Radio network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved energy-efficient cooperative spectrum sensing schemes based on noise variance estimation for Cognitive Radio network","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095229S","chronDate":"19-20 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174422","isNumber":"7192777","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174422","xplore-issue":"7192777","articleId":"7193225","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193228,"authors":[{"name":"Raktim Kumar Mondol","affiliation":["BRAC University, Dhaka, Bangladesh"],"firstName":"Raktim Kumar","lastName":"Mondol","id":"37085537560"},{"name":"Md.

The unified virtual subcarrier scheduling has been achieved using virtualization, to hide the differences of heterogeneous multiplexing ways and well optimize the performances of the OFDMA-PON supporting ubiquitous service. In a multi-segment OFDMA-PON, each segment connects with a distribution fibre. If all distribution fibres are under maintenance simultaneously, it will disrupt the service continuity, thus it necessitates the proposition of an appropriate virtual subcarrier scheduling scheme. In this paper, by using virtual subcarrier migrations during each maintenance batch, only a partial set of distribution fibres are maintained, leaving the remaining ones still on to fully support operations. Correspondingly, we formulate this problem aiming to minimize the number of maintenance batches with guaranteeing an acceptable service delay. By simulations, a good trade-off solution is achieved for maintenance efficiency and service delay in the OFDMA-PON supporting wireline-wireless convergence.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193310","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193310.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193310","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing maintenance efficiency in OFDMA-PONs supporting wireline-wireless convergence","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193310","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing maintenance efficiency in OFDMA-PONs supporting wireline-wireless convergence","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193310/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366333","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7193310/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing maintenance efficiency in OFDMA-PONs supporting wireline-wireless convergence","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"MoB33.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040068S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193330,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The main two degrading factors in UV links are high path loss and intersymbol interference resulting from the frequency selectivity nature of the channel. In this paper, we propose the powerful combination of relay-assisted (cooperative) transmission and multicarrier architecture based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) for a superior performance over UV channels. Specifically, we consider a cooperative diversity system with orthogonal cooperation protocol and use DC-biased optical OFDM as the underlying physical layer. We investigate the error rate performance of the proposed relay-assisted OFDM UV system and demonstrate significant performance gains over point-to-point OFDM UV systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193339.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Relay-assisted OFDM for NLOS ultraviolet communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Relays","Bit error rate","Nonlinear optics","Receivers","Adaptive optics","Integrated optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light interference","OFDM modulation","optical communication","optical links","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay assisted OFDM","NLOS ultraviolet communication","UV communication","ultraviolet communication","non-line-of-sight","NLOS outdoor wireless connectivity","infrared links","intersymbol interference","frequency selectivity","multicarrier architecture","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical wireless communication","ultraviolet communication","OFDM","cooperative transmission"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Relay-assisted OFDM for NLOS ultraviolet communication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193339/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366231","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay-assisted OFDM for NLOS ultraviolet communication","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"MoC26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.078729S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193358,"authors":[{"name":"Tobias Fehenberger","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Tobias","lastName":"Fehenberger","id":"37074238100"},{"name":"Norbert Hanik","affiliation":["Institute for Communications Engineering, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Hanik","id":"37264876400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7880-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"7193358","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Decoding","High definition video","Phase shift keying","Parity check codes","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","forward error correction","optical fibre networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["forward error correction analysis","optical fiber systems","achievable rates","suboptimal hard decision","HD","soft-decision","SD decoding","memoryless channel","FEC","asymptotic limit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Achievable rates","mutual information","forward error correction","optical communication systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193358","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193358","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193358.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of forward error correction and achievable rates for optical fiber systems","abstract":"We study lower bounds on mutual information that are achievable rates for optimal and sub-optimal hard-decision (HD) and soft-decision (SD) decoding.

The digital chaotic sequences are employed in PTS/SLM schemes to encrypt the OFDM data, which provides a huge key space to enhance the physical layer confidentiality. Transmission of 8.9Gb/s 16QAM encrypted OFDM signals is demonstrated over 20km standard single-mode fiber, which shows the security enhancement against malicious eavesdropping or exhaustive attacks. Moreover, the proposed secure schemes improve the OFDM transmission performance since the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the OFDM signals is significantly reduced by the signal scrambling.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193392","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193392.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Chaotic signal scrambling for physical layer security in OFDM-PON","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193392","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Chaotic signal scrambling for physical layer security in OFDM-PON","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193392/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366121","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7193392/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Chaotic signal scrambling for physical layer security in OFDM-PON","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"TuA14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075978S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193392","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193393,"authors":[{"name":"Son Thai Le","affiliation":["Aston University, Birmingham, Birmingham, GB"],"firstName":"Son Thai","lastName":"Le"},{"name":"Sergei K.

Contrary to other tuning existing methods applied to these networks (Ziegler-Nichols (ZN), genetic algorithms (GA)), our proposal, based on neural networks, makes a real time and an automatic readjustment of the tuning parameters according to the updated network conditions. Therefore, the neural network makes the tuning process online in contrast to ZN and genetic algorithms, in which the tuning process is made offline just before the PON activates the PID controller. Indeed, the PID controller together with the neural network efficiently guarantees minimum bandwidth levels to users depending on their priority profiles. This new tuning technique has been compared with the manual ZN method and with a tuning technique based on a genetic algorithm. Simulation results demonstrated that the neural network efficiently automates the tuning process, achieving higher accuracy than the other methods when guaranteeing the stipulated bandwidth values to different priority profiles. Furthermore, the integration of neural networks in PID systems to manage network resources in PONs has been never considered before.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193425","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193425.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive-tuning method based on neural networks for PID controllers applied to Passive Optical Networks (PONs)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tuning","Artificial neural networks","Bandwidth","Real-time systems","Training","Biological neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","neural nets","passive optical networks","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive-tuning method","neural networks","PID controllers","passive optical networks","PON","Ziegler-Nichols","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)","Neural Network (NN)","Passive Optical Network (PON)","tuning process","Dynamic Bandwidth (DBA)","Quality of Service (QoS)","guarantee bandwidth"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193425/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive-tuning method based on neural networks for PID controllers applied to Passive Optical Networks (PONs)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193425/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366275","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive-tuning method based on neural networks for PID controllers applied to Passive Optical Networks (PONs)","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"TuB23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050511S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193425","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7193444,"authors":[{"name":"Yelin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Yelin","lastName":"Wang","id":"38242093000"},{"name":"Torben Larsen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Systems, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Torben","lastName":"Larsen","id":"37271924000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7880-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"7193444","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Ports (Computers)","Load modeling","Power amplifiers","Scattering parameters","Power measurement","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio equipment","radiofrequency power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["X-parameter application","RF power amplifier behavioral model","wireless communication","S-parameter extension","nonlinear system","radio frequency power amplifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["X-parameters","S-parameters","behavior modeling","power amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193444","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193444","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193444.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applications of X-parameters in behavioral modeling of RF power amplifiers for wireless communications: An overview","abstract":"X-parameters are developed as an extension of S-parameters.

Standard FPGAs and low-cost multi-channel analogue-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analogue converters (DACs) have been used. For enhanced robustness and optimal usage of the power amplifier, \u03c0/4-shift differential quaternary phase-shift keying (DQPSK) modulation is used. All digital signal processing routines for synchronization, equalization, forward error correction etc. have been fully implemented and tested. Using a protocol analyzer, error-free bidirectional transmission of Ethernet frames at 5 Gbit/s is verified. Error-vector magnitude (EVM) values below -30 dB indicate that even higher speeds could be realized.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193479","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193479.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193479","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"5 Gbit/s real-time processing using \u03c0/4-shift DQPSK for bidirectional radio-over-fibre system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193479","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193479/","displayDocTitle":"5 Gbit/s real-time processing using \u03c0/4-shift DQPSK for bidirectional radio-over-fibre system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366210","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193479/","conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"5 Gbit/s real-time processing using \u03c0/4-shift DQPSK for bidirectional radio-over-fibre system","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"TuD23.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058039S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193497,"authors":[{"name":"Mhd.

The semiconductor varactor shows considerable advantages in terms of tuning range, tuning voltage, tuning speed, and losses in comparison to the ferroelectric varactor, which was a thick-film Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) device. A fixed matching network power amplifier (FMN-PA) was fabricated in order to enable comparisons with a previously designed tunable matching network (TMN) load modulation PA based on BST. Both PAs are driven in class C, operate at 1.8 GHz and use a GaN HEMT. The maximum measured drain efficiencies for the FMN-PA and TMN-PA are 79 % and 69 % at the maximum output power of 43 dBm. At 6 dB back-off output power the efficiencies are 45% and 62% respectively, after controlling the bias voltage for the TMN case. Better performance for the TMN-PA is achievable using the semiconductor varactor according to the obtained characterization results of this work.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193497","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193497.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193497","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of high voltage varactors for load modulation of GaN-HEMT power amplifier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of high voltage varactors for load modulation of GaN-HEMT power amplifier","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7193497/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366057","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193497/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of high voltage varactors for load modulation of GaN-HEMT power amplifier","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"TuD61.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067823S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7193501,"authors":[{"name":"Zolt\u00e1n Szalay","affiliation":["Dept. of Broadband Infocommunications and Electromagnetic Theory, BME, Egry J\u00f3zsef 18, H-1111, Hungary"],"firstName":"Zolt\u00e1n","lastName":"Szalay"},{"name":"Lajos Nagy","affiliation":["Dept. of Broadband Infocommunications and Electromagnetic Theory, BME, Hungary"],"firstName":"Lajos","lastName":"Nagy","id":"37300291000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7880-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"7193501","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":554},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193501","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Direction-of-arrival estimation","Estimation","Antenna arrays","Radar antennas","Radar","Aircraft"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","antenna radiation patterns","array signal processing","autonomous aerial vehicles","direction-of-arrival estimation","linear antenna arrays","matrix inversion","object detection","particle filtering (numerical methods)","radar antennas","radar detection","radar signal processing","redundancy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direction-of-arrival antenna array estimation","unmanned aerial vehicle","UAV backscatter","collision avoidance system","ultrasonic wave radar equipment","radio wave radar equipment","target detection","radar target DOA estimation","uniform linear array","minimum redundancy array","MRA beamforming array","ULA beamforming array","sidelobe level","adaptive antenna applications","antenna mutual coupling","ray tracing method","distributed signal source","sample matrix inversion","SMI","particle filter","Capon","MUSIC","conventional beamformer","CP","BF"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["radar","DOA","antenna array"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193501","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193501.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Target modeling, antenna array design and conventional beamforming algorithms for radar target DOA estimation","abstract":"Collision avoidance systems for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) use ultrasonic or radio wave radar equipment, for target detection. In direction-of-arrival (DOA) antenna array estimation, the direction of a signal is usually assumed to be a point. The article analyze the Uniform Linear Array(ULA) and Minimum Redundancy Array (MRA) beamforming arrays taken into account the mutual coupling between the antenna array elements. Simulation is performed for real antenna arrays and is shown that the sidelobe level is increasing for each array but for MRA the symmetry also distorted. Therefore for adaptive antenna applications is especially important the compensation of mutual coupling of antennas. Conventional beamformer (BF), Capon (CP), MUSIC and sample matrix inversion (SMI) based on particle filter are investigated and compared. In this paper, we consider aerial vehicle backscatter using ray tracing method and DOA estimation when the signal sources are distributed. Model for distributed source is proposed, and estimation methods are considered under this models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193501/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15366223","publicationDate":"July 2015","conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193501/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Target modeling, antenna array design and conventional beamforming algorithms for radar target DOA estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Target modeling, antenna array design and conventional beamforming algorithms for radar target DOA estimation","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"TuD65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032174S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7193503,"authors":[{"name":"Steven De Lausnay","affiliation":["DraMCo Research Group, KU Leuven, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"De Lausnay","id":"38233118200"},{"name":"Lieven De Strycker","affiliation":["DraMCo Research Group, KU Leuven, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Lieven","lastName":"De Strycker","id":"37669702800"},{"name":"Jean-Pierre Goemaere","affiliation":["DraMCo Research Group, KU Leuven, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Jean-Pierre","lastName":"Goemaere","id":"37669703700"},{"name":"Bart Nauwelaers","affiliation":["TELEMIC, KU Leuven, Leuven"],"firstName":"Bart","lastName":"Nauwelaers","id":"37085366024"},{"name":"Nobby Stevens","affiliation":["DraMCo Research Group, KU Leuven, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nobby","lastName":"Stevens","id":"37430298300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7880-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"7193503","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a test bench for a Visible Light Positioning (VLP) system using Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). A VLP system should be easy and low cost to install in existing infrastructures meaning there is no backbone network between the LEDs. CDMA can therefore be used as multiple access technology, with the challenging observation that the LEDs are transmitting data in a non-synchronized way to the receiver. Because the VLP system uses the received optical power for the positioning algorithm, Multiple Access Interference (MAI) can introduce errors. For the evaluation of the influence of MAI a test bench was developed where different CDMA codes are used in a VLP system. From practical measurements it is demonstrated that our approach leads to position errors smaller than 20 cm, making the system suitable for indoor Location Based Services (LBS).","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193503.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193503","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A test bench for a VLP system using CDMA as Multiple Access Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Multiaccess communication","Optical transmitters","Optical fibers","Optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","indoor navigation","optical fibre communication","optical receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLP system","CDMA","visible light positioning system","code division multiple access technology","optical receiver","multiple access interference","MAI","indoor location based services","LBS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["visible light communication","indoor positioning","code division multiple access","location based services","visible light positioning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193503/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A test bench for a VLP system using CDMA as Multiple Access Technology","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193503/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366159","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A test bench for a VLP system using CDMA as Multiple Access Technology","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"TuP01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043228S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193503","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193505,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00e1bor Szab\u00f3","affiliation":["Department of Broadband Infocommunications and Electromagnetic Theory, Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Budapest, Hungary"],"firstName":"G\u00e1bor","lastName":"Szab\u00f3","id":"38154495700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7880-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"7193505","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":388},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lighting","Code division multiplexing","Receivers","Light emitting diodes","Optical transmitters","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiplexing","indoor navigation","LED lamps","optical modulation","optical transmitters","orthogonal codes","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLC-CDM based indoor positioning","code division multiplexing technique","visible light communication","LED lamp","radio connection","radiofrequency domain","transmitter","digital modulation","quasi-orthogonal code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CDM","CDMA","multiplexing","VLC"]}],"abstract":"The visible light communication (VLC) with LED lamps is a very promising technique which can be a possible alternative to certain simplex radio connections aiming to relieve the quickly saturating radio frequency domain. The advantages of visible light communication can be exploited by indoor applications most efficiently. Because - similarly to radio communications - it may be necessary to run more connections simultaneously, the signals of each transmitter must be discriminable. A certain method that ensures the discriminability of signals is code division multiplexing (CDM). In this multiplexing method the channels share a common frequency band but the signals of different transmitters use digital modulation with different quasi-orthogonal codes. In my study I show step-by-step how to realize a VLC CDM system. I approximate the parameters of a system of this type by simulation models, design the software to real-time communication and verify the functionality of VLC CDM scheme with visible light demonstration circuits.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193505","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193505.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193505","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of code division multiplexing technique for VLC-based indoor positioning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193505","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of code division multiplexing technique for VLC-based indoor positioning","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193505/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193505/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366110","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of code division multiplexing technique for VLC-based indoor positioning","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"TuP03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031318S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193508,"authors":[{"name":"Latifa Guesmi","affiliation":["Gres Com Laboratory, Engineering School of Communication of Tunis (Sup 'Com), Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Latifa","lastName":"Guesmi","id":"37085384974"},{"name":"Mourad Menif","affiliation":["Gres Com Laboratory, Engineering School of Communication of Tunis (Sup 'Com), Ariana, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mourad","lastName":"Menif","id":"37268447600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7880-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"7193508","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":298},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","OFDM","Binary phase shift keying","Optical modulation","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","numerical analysis","optical fibre dispersion","optical modulation","radio-over-fibre","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modulation formats recognition technique","artificial neural networks","radio-over-fiber systems","RoF systems","ANN method","asynchronous amplitude histograms","high bit rates","direct detection","complex classification problems","sequential training algorithm","transmission impairments","chromatic dispersion","differential group delay","DGD","optical signal to-noise ratio","OSNR","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["modulation format recognition","radio-over-fiber","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","artificial neural network","amplitude histograms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193508","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193508","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","abstract":"In this paper, we present and investigate a novel method for modulation formats recognition for radio-over-fiber (RoF) systems.

The proposed scheme employs BPSK and QPSK modulation formats for low and high rate transmission users, respectively. In addition, we develop a general formalism that allows performance evaluation of legacy networks based on on-off keying (OOK) modulation format. We investigate how the coherent demodulation of encoded fast frequency hopping (FFH) signals under multiple access-interference (MAI) can improve the network performance. It is shown for the first time that simultaneous users of different transmission rates can surprisingly achieve BER levels in the error-free region.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193510","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193510.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193510","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multirate FFH-OCDMA networks based on coherent advanced modulation formats","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193510","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193510/","displayDocTitle":"Multirate FFH-OCDMA networks based on coherent advanced modulation formats","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366142","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193510/","conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multirate FFH-OCDMA networks based on coherent advanced modulation formats","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"TuP08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038469S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193510","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193514,"authors":[{"name":"Seyed Hadi Hashemi Rafsanjani","affiliation":["ICT Research Center, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Seyed Hadi","lastName":"Hashemi Rafsanjani","id":"37088495298"},{"name":"Mohammad Noshad","affiliation":["Virginia University, Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Noshad","id":"38264083800"},{"name":"Christian-Alexander Bunge","affiliation":["Hochschule f\u00fcr Telekommunikation Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian-Alexander","lastName":"Bunge","id":"37313997200"},{"name":"Daniel Pastor","affiliation":["Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Espa\u00f1a"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Pastor","id":"37270910100"},{"name":"Kambiz Jamshidi","affiliation":["Integrated Photonic Devices, Communications Laboratory, Technische Universit\u00e4t Dresden, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Kambiz","lastName":"Jamshidi","id":"37398559900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7880-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"7193514","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Passive optical networks","Error probability","Coherence","Adaptive optics","Integrated optics","Optical fibers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","error statistics","passive optical networks","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2D OCDMA system","bit error probability distribution","beat noise","passive optical network","two-dimensional optical code division multiple access technique"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["two dimensional optical code division multiple access","phase induced intensity noise","passive optical networks"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the probability distribution and error probability of the detected energy of a 2D-OCDMA system are calculated.

In this paper, we introduce a framework for designing an energy efficient architecture for 5G mobile network function virtualization. In the proposed architecture, the main functionalities of the mobile core network which include the packet gateway (P-GW), serving gateway (S-GW), mobility management entity (MME), policy control and charging role function, and the home subscriber server (HSS) functions are virtualized and provisioned on demand. We also virtualize the functions of the base band unit (BBU) of the evolved node B (eNB) and offload them from the mobile radio side. We leverage the capabilities of gigabit passive optical networks (GPON) as the radio access technology to connect the remote radio head (RRH) to new virtualized BBUs. We consider the IP/WDM backbone network and the GPON based access network as the hosts of virtual machines (VMs) where network functions will be implemented. Two cases were investigated; in the first case, we considered virtualization in the IP/WDM network only (since the core network is typically the location that supports virtualization) and in the second case we considered virtualization in both the IP/WDM and GPON access network. Our results indicate that we can achieve energy savings of 22% on average with virtualization in both the IP/WDM network and GPON access network compared to the case where virtualization is only done in the IP/WDM network.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193559","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193559","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193559.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy efficient network function virtualization in 5G networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Energy efficient network function virtualization in 5G networks","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193559/","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15366140","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193559/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy efficient network function virtualization in 5G networks","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"WeB21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.139922S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7193578,"authors":[{"name":"Juerg Leuthold","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Institute of Electromagnetic Fields (IEF), Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Juerg","lastName":"Leuthold","id":"37275020300"},{"name":"Christian Haffner","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Institute of Electromagnetic Fields (IEF), Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Haffner","id":"37085336222"},{"name":"Wolfgang Heni","affiliation":["Institute of Electromagnetic Fields (IEF), ETH Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Wolfgang","lastName":"Heni","id":"38490195500"},{"name":"Claudia Hoessbacher","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Institute of Electromagnetic Fields (IEF), Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Claudia","lastName":"Hoessbacher","id":"37085487920"},{"name":"Jens Niegemann","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Institute of Electromagnetic Fields (IEF), Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jens","lastName":"Niegemann","id":"37705630100"},{"name":"Yuriy Fedoryshyn","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Institute of Electromagnetic Fields (IEF), Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yuriy","lastName":"Fedoryshyn","id":"37085336314"},{"name":"Alexandros Emboras","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Institute of Electromagnetic Fields (IEF), Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Alexandros","lastName":"Emboras","id":"37085486024"},{"name":"Christian Hafner","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Institute of Electromagnetic Fields (IEF), Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Hafner","id":"37328170900"},{"name":"Argishti Melikyan","affiliation":["Institute IMT, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Argishti","lastName":"Melikyan","id":"37531965400"},{"name":"Manfred Kohl","affiliation":["Institute IMT, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Manfred","lastName":"Kohl","id":"37373593400"},{"name":"Delwin L.

We indicate their main challenges and propose some specific scenarios where they can be applied. Not only there are architectural challenges to design the RoF network to bring a high capacity to every small cell, but also a medium access control (MAC) protocol is needed to confirm the quality of service (QoS) bounds of a low latency, seamless handovers, and a high throughput. We differentiate between two approaches to design such a MAC protocol, either distributed or centralized mechanisms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193591/","conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15366325","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7193591/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Radio-over-fibre for ultra-small 5G cells","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio-over-fibre for ultra-small 5G cells","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"WeC24.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054517S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193591","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":7193616,"authors":[{"name":"Mengdi Song","affiliation":["Orange Labs Networks, Lannion Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Mengdi","lastName":"Song","id":"37074145500"},{"name":"Erwan Pincemin","affiliation":["Orange Labs Networks, Lannion Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Erwan","lastName":"Pincemin","id":"37271489600"},{"name":"Didier Grot","affiliation":["Orange Labs Networks, Lannion Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Didier","lastName":"Grot","id":"37284816000"},{"name":"Thierry Guillossou","affiliation":["Orange Labs Networks, Lannion Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Guillossou","id":"37319701900"},{"name":"Yves Jaou\u00ebn","affiliation":["Telecom ParisTech Comelec Dept., Paris, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Jaou\u00ebn","id":"37085423797"},{"name":"Rapha\u00ebl Le Bidan","affiliation":["Signal & Commun.

The inscription of FBGs with femtosecond (fs) laser pulses is particularly interesting, as it not only enables direct inscription into virtually any kind of optical fibre, but also offers an unprecedented control over the reflection and dispersion profiles of those gratings. In this paper we report on a novel core-scanning technique for the fabrication of novel FBGs and discuss their application in ultrashort-pulsed fibre laser systems as well as distributed feedback (DFB) lasers. In addition, we also show their suitability for sensing applications in radioactive environments.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193706","publicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 17th International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks (ICTON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7173926/7193279/07193706.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2015.7193706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7193279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Femtosecond direct-writing of low-loss fibre Bragg gratings with arbitrary reflection and dispersion profiles","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193706","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-9 July 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7193706/","displayDocTitle":"Femtosecond direct-writing of low-loss fibre Bragg gratings with arbitrary reflection and dispersion profiles","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15399095","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7193706/","conferenceDate":"5-9 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Femtosecond direct-writing of low-loss fibre Bragg gratings with arbitrary reflection and dispersion profiles","confLoc":"Budapest, Hungary","sourcePdf":"ThA63.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060756S","chronDate":"5-9 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7173926","isNumber":"7193279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7173926","xplore-issue":"7193279","articleId":"7193706","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7193732,"authors":[{"name":"Giovanna Cal\u00f2","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dell'Informazione, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Giovanna","lastName":"Cal\u00f2","id":"37299138800"},{"name":"Vincenzo Petruzzelli","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Ingegneria Elettrica e dell'Informazione, Politecnico di Bari, Bari, Italy"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Petruzzelli","id":"37264975700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7880-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2064"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"7193732","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":102},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7193732","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ports (Computers)","Gratings","Optical waveguides","Nonhomogeneous media","Photonics","Optical filters","Waveguide discontinuities"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["demultiplexing equipment","finite difference time-domain analysis","integrated optics","multiplexing equipment","network-on-chip","optical communication equipment","optical couplers","optical design techniques","optical filters","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelength routers","multilayer integrated optical networks-on-chip","grating-assisted vertical couplers","add-drop filters","multilayer optical network","mode analysis","finite difference time domain simulations","FDTD","multiplexers","demultiplexers","higher-order three-dimensional matrices","wavelength routing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["photonic networks on chip","grating assisted couplers","add-drop filters","multilayer optical networks"]}],"abstract":"The design and analysis of grating-assisted vertical couplers, which behave as add-drop filters, is proposed for routing the signal among the different layers of a multilayer optical network.

Blind equalization is an interesting solution with regard to the spectral efficiency since no pilot is used for the signal recovering, but blind iterative algorithms suffer from a large convergence speed toward the steady-state. An initialization strategy using features of the OFDM/OQAM modulation scheme is proposed in order to improve the convergence speed of the blind equalizer. It is shown that no optimal solution can be found in the complex field, but a sub-optimal initialization value can be derived in the real subset. Simulations results show that a gain of thousands of iterations is achieved by the proposed initialization method compared with the technique that consists of setting the same initialized value for all subcarriers.","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194029","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194029.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194029","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sub-optimal initialization for blind equalization with fast convergence in OFDM/OQAM modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194029","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194029/","displayDocTitle":"Sub-optimal initialization for blind equalization with fast convergence in OFDM/OQAM modulation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15366937","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194029/","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sub-optimal initialization for blind equalization with fast convergence in OFDM/OQAM modulation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p1savaux.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099633S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194029","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194030,"authors":[{"name":"Svilen Dimitrov","affiliation":["Satellite Networks Department, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Svilen","lastName":"Dimitrov","id":"37398271200"},{"name":"Niccol\u00f3 Privitera","affiliation":["Mavigex S.r.1.

Key solutions to the challenges in a geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite channel, such as synchronization and non-linear distortion, are presented. A global-positioning-system-(GPS)-based approach for synchronization acquisition is proposed, while suitable algorithms are studied for timing/frequency offset estimation and synchronization tracking. The spectral and power efficiencies of the schemes are optimized by means of an intermodulation interference (IMI) cancelling receiver, and these are compared to state-of-the-art time division multiple access (TDMA). Finally, end-to-end simulations validate the system performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194030.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"10","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194030","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194030","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrally efficient waveforms for the return link in satellite communication systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Synchronization","Signal to noise ratio","Time division multiple access","OFDM","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","frequency division multiple access","Global Positioning System","interference suppression","intermodulation","mobile satellite communication","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radiofrequency interference","satellite links","spectral analysis","synchronisation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IMI cancelling receiver","intermodulation interference cancelling receiver","power efficiency","spectral efficiency","timing-frequency offset estimation","synchronization acquisition","GPS-based approach","Global Positioning System-based approach","GEO satellite channel","geostationary orbit satellite channel","FBMC","filter bank multicarrier","SC-FDMA","single-carrier frequency division multiple access","OFDMA","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","HTS communication system","high throughput satellite communication system","terrestrial mobile waveform","return link","spectrally efficient waveform"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Satellite communications","spectral and power efficiencies","synchronization","OFDMA","SC-FDMA","FBMC"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194030/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spectrally efficient waveforms for the return link in satellite communication systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194030/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15381072","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrally efficient waveforms for the return link in satellite communication systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p6dimitrov.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075444S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194030","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194031,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Cagatay Cirik","affiliation":["Centre for Wireless Communications.

In this context, spectrum sharing techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to increase capacity and reduce costs in order to allow SatCom to meet the DAE objectives. The EU FP7 Project CoRaSat is assessing Cognitive Radio (CR) techniques for Ka-band SatCom scenarios, showing that coexistence between Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) and Broadcasting Satellite System (BSS)/Fixed Service (FS) links would introduce significant benefits in non-exclusive frequency bands. In this paper, spectrum awareness and exploitation techniques are analyzed. Simulation results show that significant improvements can be obtained in both spectrum utilization (up to 2.4 GHz of additional spectrum) and available throughput (up to 600% increase).","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194032.pdf","startPage":"16","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194032","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194032","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectrum awareness and exploitation for Cognitive Radio Satellite Communications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency selective surfaces","Interference","Satellites","Satellite broadcasting","Databases","Downlink","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum awareness","cognitive radio satellite communications","digital agenda for Europe","DAE","broadband communications","SatCom","spectrum sharing techniques","EU FP7 Project CoRaSat","CR techniques","Ka-band SatCom","fixed satellite service","FSS","broadcasting satellite system","exploitation techniques","spectrum utilization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Spectrum awareness and exploitation for Cognitive Radio Satellite Communications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194032/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15366928","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectrum awareness and exploitation for Cognitive Radio Satellite Communications","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p16guidotti.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072036S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194033,"authors":[{"name":"Claude Desset","affiliation":["IMEC, Belgium"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Desset","id":"37266662400"},{"name":"Liesbet Van der Perre","affiliation":["IMEC, Belgium"],"firstName":"Liesbet","lastName":"Van der Perre","id":"37085448497"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7359-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7358-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7194033","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":282},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194033","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization (signal)","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Base stations","Antennas","Interference","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","mobile radio","quantisation (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low accuracy quantization validation","massive MIMO system","constellation EVM analysis","cellular system","digital signal processing","power consumption"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Massive MIMO","quantization"]}],"abstract":"Massive MIMO is a promising approach in order to increase the data rate of cellular systems while reducing their power consumption. While the concept is elegant, many potential show-stoppers have to be investigated, in order to make sure that the idea keeps its promises. On such element is the claim that massive MIMO systems can operate with very low digital signal processing accuracy, and hence reduced implementation complexity and power consumption. In this paper, we investigate the impact of digital quantization of massive MIMO at low resolution. Simulations show that the system can operate correctly with as few as 2 or 3 bits of digital resolution at the end of the digital chain, while limiting the degradation to 1 dB in required signal-to-noise ratio.","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194033","startPage":"21","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194033.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194033","endPage":"25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Validation of low-accuracy quantization in massive MIMO and constellation EVM analysis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Validation of low-accuracy quantization in massive MIMO and constellation EVM analysis","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194033/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15366946","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Validation of low-accuracy quantization in massive MIMO and constellation EVM analysis","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p21desset.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044486S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194033","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194038,"authors":[{"name":"George Arvanitakis","affiliation":["Eurecom Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Arvanitakis","id":"37085402609"},{"name":"Florian Kaltenberger","affiliation":["Eurecom Sophia Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Kaltenberger","id":"37392197300"},{"name":"Ioannis Dagres","affiliation":["Institute of Accelerating Systems and Applications NKUA, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Ioannis","lastName":"Dagres","id":"37697662000"},{"name":"Andreas Polydoros","affiliation":["King Abdulaziz University Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Institute of Accelerating Systems and Applications NKUA, Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Polydoros","id":"37271033000"},{"name":"Adrian Kliks","affiliation":["Poznan University of Technology Poznan, Poland"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Kliks","id":"37645975800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7359-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7358-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7194038","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":56},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Fading","Current measurement","Europe","Transmitters","Density measurement","Measurement uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","fading channels","indoor radio","radiowave propagation","statistical analysis","telecommunication network topology","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-based localization","correlated log-normal fading","conditioning measurements","performance evaluation","Cramer-Rao lower bound","spatially-correlated log-normal propagation","sensor topology","current measurements","statistical uncertainty reduction","indoor environments","outdoor environments","scaling quantification","sensor-network size","prespecified localization accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Received signal strength","localization","lognormal","spatial correlation","Cramer-Rao Lower Bound"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194038","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194038","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","abstract":"The paper addresses the performance evaluation via the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of power-based localization of a source in spatially-correlated log-normal propagation.

This causes impairment in directly observing cosmic sources. Therefore, current knowledge of the universe is inaccurate being obtained from filtered signals. However, accurate knowledge can be obtained in RASs via a pristine observation of Srcs using cognitive radio (CR) technology. This paper, examines the suitability of CR spectrum sharing models for interference protection of RASs. It proposes an interference protection framework and investigates the satellite's transmit opportunities using visibility duration data of RASs. It then examines the end to end delay of the satellite network when the framework is used.

During natural disasters or unexpected events, terrestrial infrastructure can be seriously damaged or disrupted due to physical destruction of network components, disruption in subsystem interconnections and/or network congestion. In this context, Aerial-Terrestrial communication networks are intended to provide temporal large coverage with the provision of broadband services at the disaster area. This paper studies the performance of Aerial UMTS Long Term Evolution (LTE) base stations in terms of coverage and capacity. Network model relies on appropriate channel model, LTE 3GPP specifications and well known schedulers are used. The results show the effect of the temperature, bandwidth, and scheduling discipline on the system capacity while at the same time coverage is investigated in different public safety scenarios.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Safety","Computer architecture","Bandwidth","Indexes","Long Term Evolution","Phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","aircraft communication","broadband networks","disasters","Long Term Evolution","telecommunication scheduling","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerial LTE base station capacity evaluation","public safety communication","aerial-terrestrial communication network congestion","natural disaster","aerial UMTS long term evolution base station","channel model","LTE 3GPP specification"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aerial network infrastructure","emergency communications","low altitude platforms","Long Term Evolution (LTE)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194055","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194055","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194055.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194055","startPage":"133","endPage":"138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity evaluation of Aerial LTE base-stations for public safety communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Capacity evaluation of Aerial LTE base-stations for public safety communications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194055/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194055/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15381077","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity evaluation of Aerial LTE base-stations for public safety communications","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p133gomez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069963S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7194056,"authors":[{"name":"Oleksandr Andryeyev","affiliation":["Integrated Communication Systems Group Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Andryeyev","id":"37085485613"},{"name":"Oleksandr Artemenko","affiliation":["Integrated Communication Systems Group Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Oleksandr","lastName":"Artemenko","id":"37847139100"},{"name":"Andreas Mitschele-Thiel","affiliation":["Integrated Communication Systems Group Technische Universit\u00e4t Ilmenau, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Mitschele-Thiel","id":"38271075600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7359-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7358-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7194056","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Antenna arrays","Receiving antennas","Time-frequency analysis","Propagation losses","Ad hoc networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","autonomous aerial vehicles","cognitive radio","directive antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["small unmanned aerial vehicle","system capacity improvement","cognitive radio","intelligent radio","spectrum efficiency management","CR ad hoc network","CRAHN","lightweight directional antenna","UAV","mechanical rotation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","ad hoc networks","directional antenna","fixed beam","SDMA","interference estimation","simulation"]}],"abstract":"The Cognitive Radio (CR) or intelligent radio becomes increasingly an anticipated and promising solution to manage spectrum efficiency problems.

This work proposes to use lightweight directional antennas with a fixed beam on small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and evaluates their performance using software simulations.

The commonly agreed solution to overcome the current limitations of wireless access networks is to deploy very dense and heterogeneous wireless networks, the so-called DenseNets. Simply scaling existing networks by orders of magnitude, as required to fulfill traffic forecasts, would bring along several problems because of the limited backhaul capacity, the increased energy consumption, and the explosion of signalling. Hence, the FP7 project CROWD proposes a novel architecture for DenseNets as a solution to tame the density of wireless networks. Within this architecture, flexible flow processing-aware controller placement supported by dynamic backhaul reconfiguration is the crucial component to both (i) maximize the amount of users that can be served simultaneously under high load, and (ii) minimize energy consumption and reduce costs for service providers. We present both approaches in detail and outline how they are integrated into the overall CROWD architecture.","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194057.pdf","startPage":"144","endPage":"148","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194057","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194057","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194057","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Mobile communication","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio networks","software defined networking","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic network reconfiguration","wireless DenseNets","CROWD SDN architecture","wireless access network traffic","traffic forecasts","backhaul capacity","flexible flow processing aware controller placement","dynamic backhaul reconfiguration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194057/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic network reconfiguration in wireless DenseNets with the CROWD SDN architecture","accessionNumber":"15366963","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7194057/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic network reconfiguration in wireless DenseNets with the CROWD SDN architecture","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p144auroux.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068201S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194059,"authors":[{"name":"Jose Costa-Requena","affiliation":["Aalto-yliopisto, Aalto, FI"],"firstName":"Jose","lastName":"Costa-Requena","id":"38288673900"},{"name":"Jes\u00fas Llorente Santos","affiliation":["Aalto University Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Jes\u00fas Llorente","lastName":"Santos","id":"37085552823"},{"name":"Vicent Ferrer Guasch","affiliation":["Aalto University Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Vicent Ferrer","lastName":"Guasch","id":"37085563570"},{"name":"Kimmo Ahokas","affiliation":["Aalto University Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Kimmo","lastName":"Ahokas","id":"37085557942"},{"name":"Gopika Premsankar","affiliation":["Aalto University Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Gopika","lastName":"Premsankar","id":"37085552917"},{"name":"Sakari Luukkainen","affiliation":["Aalto University Espoo, Finland"],"firstName":"Sakari","lastName":"Luukkainen","id":"37304116300"},{"name":"Oscar L\u00f3pez P\u00e9rez","affiliation":["Nextel S.A.

Different technologies such as Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) and Software Defined Networking (SDN) are being considered to address the future needs of 5G networks. However, future applications such as Internet of Things (IoT), video services and others still unveiled will have different requirements, which emphasize the need for the dynamic scalability of the network functionality. The means for efficient network resource operability seems to be even more important than the future network element costs. This paper provides the analysis of different technologies such as SDN and NFV that offer different architectural options to address the needs of 5G networks. The options under consideration in this paper may differ mainly in the extent of what SDN principles are applied to mobile specific functions or to transport network functions only.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mobile computing","Cloud computing","5G mobile communication","Virtualization","Computer architecture","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["5G mobile communication","software defined networking","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile core network evolution","5G networks","network functions virtualization","NFV","software defined networking","SDN","dynamic scalability","network functionality","network resource operability","mobile specific functions","transport network functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["SDN","NFV","5G","Virtualization"]}],"doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194059","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194059.pdf","startPage":"154","endPage":"158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194059","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SDN and NFV integration in generalized mobile network architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194059","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SDN and NFV integration in generalized mobile network architecture","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194059/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194059/","accessionNumber":"15366927","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SDN and NFV integration in generalized mobile network architecture","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p154costarequena.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059653S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194059","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":7194062,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However C-RAN demands a new energy consumption model and its resources optimised. This Paper presented the C-RAN to reduce the network cost further by dynamically allocating centralised Base Band Unit (BBU) resources to Remote Radio Heads (RRHs) depending on the traffic conditions. New energy consumption model for C-RAN has been proposed for capturing the energy consumption of centralised BBU resources which reflect the dynamic allocation of RRHs. An algorithm that optimises the BBU resource allocation has been proposed. BBUs are put to sleep and active states by switching them `OFF' and `ON' respectively according to their resource usage. Numerical results based on simulation settings validated the theoretical analyses and revealed more than 70% power reduction compared to conventional RAN under the EARTH power model.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194062.pdf","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194062","startPage":"169","endPage":"174","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing energy consumption by dynamic resource allocation in C-RAN","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194062/","displayDocTitle":"Reducing energy consumption by dynamic resource allocation in C-RAN","htmlLink":"/document/7194062/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15381075","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing energy consumption by dynamic resource allocation in C-RAN","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p169khan.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060108S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194062","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194063,"authors":[{"name":"Svilen Dimitrov","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Svilen","lastName":"Dimitrov","id":"37398271200"},{"name":"Stefan Erl","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Stefan","lastName":"Erl","id":"37085546563"},{"name":"Benjamin Barth","affiliation":["German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Barth","id":"37085559562"},{"name":"Stephan Jaeckel","affiliation":["Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Jaeckel","id":"37296970700"},{"name":"Argyrios Kyrgiazos","affiliation":["University of Surrey, Centre for Communication Systems Research, UK"],"firstName":"Argyrios","lastName":"Kyrgiazos","id":"38076827300"},{"name":"Barry G.

In fact, most of the frequency bands suitable for mobile communications are already in use by other radio services, and spectrum refarming is usually not possible or constitutes a highly time-consuming procedure. At the same time, several field measurement campaigns have shown that the occupied spectrum below 6GHz is severely underutilized, i.e. there exist \u201cspectrum holes\u201d in the time, frequency, and space dimensions, pointing to the possibility of using spectrum sharing as a mean to better exploit additional spectral resources. Licensed shared access (LSA) is a recent spectrum licensing paradigm that allows licensees to share the licensed spectrum of incumbents without causing harmful interference and ensuring a certain quality-of-service (QoS) for both types of players. The EU-funded project ADEL aims to enhance the current LSA paradigm by introducing 1) dynamic radio resource management (RRM), 2) sensing reasoning, based on database-assisted collaborative sensor networking, and 3) an extension to the LSA architecture that allows a more effective RRM, increasing QoS satisfaction and policy enforcement for all players, finally leading to an overall improved spectrum utilization. The key features of ADEL's enhanced LSA paradigm are outlined throughout the remainder of this paper.","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194066","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194066.pdf","startPage":"190","endPage":"194","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194066","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic LSA for 5G networks the ADEL perspective","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194066","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic LSA for 5G networks the ADEL perspective","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194066/","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15381093","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194066/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic LSA for 5G networks the ADEL perspective","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p190morgado.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047183S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194066","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-11"},{"_id":7194067,"authors":[{"name":"Omer Anjum","affiliation":["Nokia Research Center, Nokia Corp., Helsinki, Finland"],"firstName":"Omer","lastName":"Anjum","id":"37603027300"},{"name":"Osman N.

The biggest challenge this densification brings along is very high interference. Thus there is an urgent need to develop strategies that could help in the first place to avoid such large interference in small cell clusters. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for dynamic radio resource management in the downlink for a cluster of heavily overlapped small cells. The scheme proposes the use of jointly considering real time interference and traffic characteristics of the small cells in the cluster. It is observed that the proposed method comparing to full reuse or fractional frequency reuse, leverages the network performance in terms of mean user throughput and total number of satisfied users, achieving \u226595% of the data-rate demand, at relatively a lower scheduling overhead.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194067","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194067.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"199","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic-aware resource sharing in ultra-dense small cell networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Traffic-aware resource sharing in ultra-dense small cell networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7194067/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15381086","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194067/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic-aware resource sharing in ultra-dense small cell networks","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p195anjum.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059188S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194067","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7194068,"authors":[{"name":"Sina Khatibi","affiliation":["INOV-INESC /Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, University of Lisbon, Portugal"],"firstName":"Sina","lastName":"Khatibi","id":"37089141498"},{"name":"Luis M.

The model has two key components: the estimation of network capacity and the data rate allocation. In the first one, the probability description of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio is used to obtain cumulative and density functions for the total network throughput. The primary objective in the second one is to achieve the maximum weighted throughput, subject to global network constraints. By using weights in an objective function, a prioritisation among services is achieved. The total network capacity, the SLAs (Service Level Agreements) of Virtual Network Operators, and fairness, are the constraints in this optimisation problem. The novelty of this paper is the addition of support for traffic offloading by considering the collision rates in Wi-Fi. The aim is to prioritise services with higher data rate per session in the offloading procedure, since it leads to a lower collision rate and a higher network throughput. A practical heterogeneous network is considered as a case study, in order to evaluate the model performance. Results show an increase of 2.5 times in network capacity, by implementing an access point at the centre of each cell. The good performance of the model and the VNOs' SLAs effect is demonstrated through numeric results.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194068","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194068.pdf","startPage":"200","endPage":"204","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194068","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modelling Virtual Radio Resource Management with traffic offloading support","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modelling Virtual Radio Resource Management with traffic offloading support","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7194068/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15366932","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194068/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modelling Virtual Radio Resource Management with traffic offloading support","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p200khatibi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053187S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7194077,"authors":[{"name":"Guodong Zhang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Guodong Zhang","id":"37085581226"},{"name":"Tian Liang","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Tian Liang","id":"37085421614"},{"name":"Wei Heng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Wei Heng","id":"37605369000"},{"name":"Chao Meng","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Chao Meng","id":"38237171000"},{"name":"Jinming Hu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing Jiangsu, China"],"lastName":"Jinming Hu","id":"37085583700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7359-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7358-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7194077","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"abstract":"Deploying smallcell networks achieves great spatial reuse at the cost of severe cross-tier interference from concurrent transmission.

The main challenge in the design and deployment of an efficient full-duplex communication is to address the problem of asymmetric data flow in a network with symmetric link capacity. A system with symmetric radio resource allocation, i.e. full-duplex, would under utilize the radio resources when downlink and uplink traffic is asymmetric. Apparently, this is because uplink or downlink may not have traffic to send on the allocated resources which results in under utilization of radio resource. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer model to accommodate asymmetric traffic in full-duplex networks. The proposed model considers the power and rate allocation for the downlink and uplink users based on the observation of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) from the physical layer and uplink traffic buffer. Full-duplex transmission characteristics are exploited for maximizing the downlink data rate for asymmetric traffic. Simulation results prove that the proposed model not only accommodate the asymmetric traffic but also improves the overall system throughput while maintaining the quality of service (QoS).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7194081/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15366951","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cross-layer approach for asymmetric traffic accommodation in full-duplex wireless network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-layer approach for asymmetric traffic accommodation in full-duplex wireless network","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p265malik.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046489S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7194084,"authors":[{"name":"David E.

Because of the large peak-to-average power ratios that occur at the relay of such systems, we deem it important to understand the negative effects that nonlinear transmissions might have at the relay. Thus, we assume that the relay is subject to its own independent transmit power constraint, beyond which nonlinear distortion is introduced. We consider two power allocation problems: 1) the transmit power budget of the communicating nodes is independent of the relay's transmit power, 2) the relay's transmit power is included within the total power budget of the network. For the former, a closed form solution is obtained. For the latter, the problem is shown to be non-convex in its standard form. By applying a substitution, we show that it can be converted into a convex problem. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods. Finally, a discussion is included to give further insight into how our power allocation scheme behaves as a function of the network's asymmetry.","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194084","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194084.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194084","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-way OFDM-based nonlinear amplify-and-forward relaying: Power allocation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194084/","displayDocTitle":"Two-way OFDM-based nonlinear amplify-and-forward relaying: Power allocation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15366969","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194084/","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-way OFDM-based nonlinear amplify-and-forward relaying: Power allocation","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p280simmons.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095518S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194088,"authors":[{"name":"Ta Duc-Tuyen","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Electronics, Telecom ParisTech, France"],"lastName":"Ta Duc-Tuyen","id":"37085423165"},{"name":"Nhan Nguyen-Thanh","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Electronics, Telecom ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Nhan","lastName":"Nguyen-Thanh","id":"38271157200"},{"name":"Philippe Ciblat","affiliation":["Department of Communications and Electronics, Telecom ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Ciblat","id":"37284917800"},{"name":"Van-Tam Nguyen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, University of California at Berkeley, USA","Department of Communications and Electronics, Telecom ParisTech, France"],"firstName":"Van-Tam","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"37085341679"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7359-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7358-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7194088","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":111},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Games"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","signal detection","telecommunication security"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["extra-sensing game","malicious primary user emulator attack","PUE attack","cognitive radio network","CR network","deny of service attack","channel probability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extra-sensing game for malicious primary user emulator attack in cognitive radio network","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194088","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","endPage":"310","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194088.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194088","startPage":"306","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194088","abstract":"Primary User Emulation (PUE) attack is a serious security problem in cognitive radio (CR) network. A PUE attacker emulates a primary signal during sensing duration in order the CR users not to use the spectrum. The PUE attacker is either selfish if it would like to take benefit of the spectrum, or malicious if it would like to do a Deny of Service of the CR network. In this paper, we only consider malicious PUE. We propose to perform sometimes an additional sensing step, called extra-sensing, in order to have a new opportunity to sense the channel and so to use it. Obviously the malicious PUE may still perform an attack during this extra-sensing. Therefore, our problem can be formulated as a zero-sum game to modeling and analyzing the strategies for two players. The equilibrium is expressed in closed-form. The results show that the benefit ratio and the probability of channel's availability strongly influence the equilibrium.

This paper analyses the performance and fairness properties of transport-layer based resource assignment methods for individual flows on a bottleneck link. To find an optimum trade-off between maximization of the overall bandwidth and fairness, the assignment problem is solved using (non-)linear programming expressed by the objective function and various constraints. For bottleneck fairness, a factor alpha is introduced where non-zero values penalize flows which occupy multiple bottlenecks, resulting in an increase of the overall throughput while sometimes reducing the fairness, which reflects the behaviour of TCP in multi-bottleneck scenarios. For two example scenarios, the results of the introduced objective functions and fairness methods are discussed and their properties compared quantitatively by means of well-known performance metrics. It is shown that, even though the investigated methods yield different bandwidth allocations for the individual flows, the performance metric results are similar for both fairness as well as throughput, so for complex scenarios which require a large amount of calculations, a method with a low computational effort, i. e. including only linear components can be selected.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194102.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"380","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194102","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fairness mechanisms for single-path capacity allocation based on mixed-integer (Non-)linear programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Linear programming","Bandwidth","Channel allocation","Measurement","Throughput","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","integer programming","IP networks","linear programming","nonlinear programming","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fairness mechanism","single-path capacity allocation","mixed-integer nonlinear programming","transport-layer based resource assignment method","bandwidth maximization","mixed-integer linear programming","TCP/IP network","bandwidth assignment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194102/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fairness mechanisms for single-path capacity allocation based on mixed-integer (Non-)linear programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194102/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15381088","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fairness mechanisms for single-path capacity allocation based on mixed-integer (Non-)linear programming","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p375singh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085503S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194102","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194104,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Because they operate in the higher layers of the protocol stack, they benefit from a lot of flexibility. In particular, since streaming applications and bulk transfer applications have different constraints, different packet scheduling strategies may be used by the sender, offering different trade-offs between decoding latency and long erasure burst protection. This work tries to find the best packet scheduling scheme(s) at a sender for a given type of AL-FEC codes. The contributions are twofold: first we define a methodology to measure the impacts of packet scheduling on AL-FEC performance, both under ITerative (IT) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding, for a large set of channels; then we apply this methodology to GLDPC-Staircase codes, an extension of LDPC-Staircase codes using Reed Solomon codes as inner codes. In previous works we showed that these codes have erasure recovery performance close to ideals codes when packets are transmitted in a random order. In this work we show that these codes perform extremely well when sending source packets sequentially first (a key requirement to keep latency minimum with streaming applications) and then extra-repair packets followed by LDPC repair packets, both in a random order.","doi":"10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194119","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EuCNC.2015.7194119","startPage":"465","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications (EuCNC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7179207/7194024/07194119.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194024","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impacts of the packet scheduling on the performance of erasure codes: Methodology and application to GLDPC-Staircase codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194119/","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of the packet scheduling on the performance of erasure codes: Methodology and application to GLDPC-Staircase codes","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15381068","publicationDate":"June 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7194119/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impacts of the packet scheduling on the performance of erasure codes: Methodology and application to GLDPC-Staircase codes","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p465mattoussi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066165S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7194122,"authors":[{"name":"Sara Faria Leal","affiliation":["CEMAT and Departmento de Matem\u00e1tica, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Sara Faria","lastName":"Leal","id":"37085563558"},{"name":"M.

From a statistical perspective, traffic anomalies can be considered outliers, and must be handled through effective outlier detection methods, for which feature selection is an important pre-processing step. Feature selection removes the redundant and irrelevant features from the detection process, increasing its performance. In this work, we consider outlier detection based on principal component analysis, and feature selection based on mutual information. Moreover, we address the use of kernel density estimation (KDE) to estimate themutual information, which is designed for continuous features, and avoids the discretization step of histograms. Our results, obtained using a high-quality ground-truth, clearly show the usefulness of feature selection and the superiority of KDE to estimate the mutual information, in the context of Internet traffic anomaly detection.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 European Conference on Networks and Communications

networks will very likely include features that allow for a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in order to exploit spectrum holes of a primary system. The efficient utilization of spectrum holes with minimum impairment of the primary system requires a waveform with a very low adjacent channel leakage ratio as well as robustness to time and frequency offsets. One of the approaches for new waveforms is Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM), a digital multi-carrier transceiver concept that employs pulse shaping filters to provide control over the transmitted signal's spectral properties. In this paper we present experimental results that evaluate the impact of the new GFDM waveform on an existing 4G system. The 4G system was based on Eurecom's OpenAirInterface for the eNB and a commercial UE. The 5G system was emulated using the LabVIEW/PXI platform with corresponding RF adapter modules from National Instruments and TUD's GFDM implementation. The experimental results show that GFDM can be used with about 5 dB higher transmit power than a corresponding orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system, before any impact on the primary system is noticeable. The results from our real-time measurements were validated by simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194125/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15381089","htmlLink":"/document/7194125/","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"Experimental analysis and simulative validation of dynamic spectrum access for coexistence of 4G and future 5G systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental analysis and simulative validation of dynamic spectrum access for coexistence of 4G and future 5G systems","confLoc":"Paris, France","sourcePdf":"p497kaltenberger.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053083S","chronDate":"June 29 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7179207","isNumber":"7194024","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7179207","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7194024","articleId":"7194125","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7194282,"authors":[{"name":"Martin Gjoreski","affiliation":["Institut Jozef Stefan, Ljubljana, SI"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Gjoreski","id":"37086242690"},{"name":"Hristijan Gjoreski","affiliation":["Institut Jozef Stefan, Ljubljana, SI"],"firstName":"Hristijan","lastName":"Gjoreski","id":"38016141600"},{"name":"Mitja Lutrek","affiliation":["Institut Jozef Stefan, Ljubljana, SI"],"firstName":"Mitja","lastName":"Lutrek","id":"37087521824"},{"name":"Matja Gams","affiliation":["Department of Intelligent Systems, Jozef Stefan Institute J ozef Stefan International Postgraduate School, Ljubljana, Slovenia"],"firstName":"Matja","lastName":"Gams","id":"37443465200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6654-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7194282","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":679},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stress","Smart phones","Accuracy","Feature extraction","Calibration","Data models","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["behavioural sciences computing","learning (artificial intelligence)","mobile computing","psychology","smart phones"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["perceived stress automatic detection","campus students","machine-learning model","student stress level detection","smartphone sources","accelerometers","audio recorder","GPS","Wi-Fi","call log","light sensor","student-specific models","person-specific models"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["stress detection","smartphone","classification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194282","doi":"10.1109/IE.2015.27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IE.2015.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194254","publicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Intelligent Environments","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 International Conference on Intelligent Environments","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194253/7194254/07194282.pdf","startPage":"132","endPage":"135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Detection of Perceived Stress in Campus Students Using Smartphones","abstract":"This paper presents an approach to detecting perceived stress in students using data collected with smartphones.

From these, features were constructed describing the students' deviation from usual behaviour. As ground truth, we used the data obtained from stress level questionnaires with three possible stress levels: \"Not stressed\", \"Slightly stressed\" and \"Stressed\". Several machine learning approaches were tested: a general models for all the students, models for cluster of similar students, and student-specific models. Our findings show that the perceived stress is highly subjective and that only person-specific models are substantially better than the baseline.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194282/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 July 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-17 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7194282/","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","publicationDate":"July 2015","accessionNumber":"15411354","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Detection of Perceived Stress in Campus Students Using Smartphones","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Detection of Perceived Stress in Campus Students Using Smartphones","confLoc":"Prague, Czech Republic","sourcePdf":"6654a132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044914S","chronDate":"15-17 July 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194253","isNumber":"7194254","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194253","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7194254","articleId":"7194282","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-21"},{"_id":7194284,"authors":[{"name":"Paolo Tripicchio","affiliation":["Gustavo Stefanini Advanced Robotics Research Center Scuola Superiore, Sant'Anna"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Tripicchio","id":"37594795600"},{"name":"Massimo Satler","affiliation":["Gustavo Stefanini Advanced Robotics Research Center Scuola Superiore, Sant'Anna"],"firstName":"Massimo","lastName":"Satler","id":"37300956200"},{"name":"Giacomo Dabisias","affiliation":["PERCeptual RObotics Lab Scuola Superiore, Sant'Anna"],"firstName":"Giacomo","lastName":"Dabisias","id":"37085363666"},{"name":"Emanuele Ruffaldi","affiliation":["PERCeptual RObotics Lab Scuola Superiore, Sant'Anna"],"firstName":"Emanuele","lastName":"Ruffaldi","id":"37394369300"},{"name":"Carlo Alberto Avizzano","affiliation":["PERCeptual RObotics Lab Scuola Superiore, Sant'Anna"],"firstName":"Carlo Alberto","lastName":"Avizzano","id":"37274154300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-6654-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7194284","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":95,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":5949},"abstract":"The use of drones in agriculture is becoming more and more popular.

This can be applied both in electric vehicles, hybrid and avionics. Therefore the development of tools, which are able to ensure continuity of service by identifying and predicting faults, is crucial to provide a reliable monitoring. This paper presents two methods based on Hidden Markov Models for the prediction of impending faults. They are based on pattern recognition, that is a data-driven approach widely used in the field of faults detection and diagnostic. This paper aims to show that methods such as Hidden Markov Models, commonly used in the diagnosis, can also be used in the field of prognosis. The first method, based on the recognition of degradation processes, allows predicting the imminent appearance of the fault and the second is based on modeling the state of degradation of the studied system. An example of application is given to demonstrate their applicability. The results show their effectiveness to predict the imminent appearance of a fault.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Workshop on Electrical Machines Design, Control and Diagnosis (WEMDCD)","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174745/7194477/07194540.pdf","startPage":"271","endPage":"278","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE Workshop on Electrical Machines Design, Control and Diagnosis (WEMDCD)","doi":"10.1109/WEMDCD.2015.7194540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WEMDCD.2015.7194540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194477","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault prognosis based on Hidden Markov Models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Hidden Markov models","Prognostics and health management","Silicon","Pattern recognition","Electric motors","Predictive models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["condition monitoring","electric motors","fault diagnosis","hidden Markov models","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault prognosis","hidden Markov models","pattern recognition","faults detection","faults diagnostic","degradation process recognition","electrical motors monitoring"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","fault prognosis","electric motors","Hidden Markov Model","pattern recognition","probability","degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194540/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-27 March 2015","displayDocTitle":"Fault prognosis based on Hidden Markov Models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194540/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"15366847","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","conferenceDate":"26-27 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault prognosis based on Hidden Markov Models","confLoc":"Turin, Italy","sourcePdf":"0271pf000566.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067732S","chronDate":"26-27 March 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174745","isNumber":"7194477","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174745","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7194477","articleId":"7194540","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194593,"authors":[{"name":"Jieming Zhu","affiliation":["Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China"],"firstName":"Jieming","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38244334400"},{"name":"Pinjia He","affiliation":["Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (CUHK Sub-Lab)"],"firstName":"Pinjia","lastName":"He","id":"37085442678"},{"name":"Qiang Fu","affiliation":["Microsoft, Washington, DC, USA"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Fu","id":"38182162400"},{"name":"Hongyu Zhang","affiliation":["Microsoft Research, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37311096800"},{"name":"Michael R.

Strategic logging placement is desired to cover necessary runtime information without incurring unintended consequences (e.g., Performance overhead, trivial logs). However, in current practice, there is a lack of rigorous specifications for developers to govern their logging behaviours. Logging has become an important yet tough decision which mostly depends on the domain knowledge of developers. To reduce the effort on making logging decisions, in this paper, we propose a \"learning to log\" framework, which aims to provide informative guidance on logging during development. As a proof of concept, we provide the design and implementation of a logging suggestion tool, Log Advisor, which automatically learns the common logging practices on where to log from existing logging instances and further leverages them for actionable suggestions to developers. Specifically, we identify the important factors for determining where to log and extract them as structural features, textual features, and syntactic features. Then, by applying machine learning techniques (e.g., Feature selection and classifier learning) and noise handling techniques, we achieve high accuracy of logging suggestions. We evaluate Log Advisor on two industrial software systems from Microsoft and two open-source software systems from Git Hub (totally 19.1M LOC and 100.6K logging statements). The encouraging experimental results, as well as a user study, demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our logging suggestion tool. We believe our work can serve as an important first step towards the goal of \"learning to log\".","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194593/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7194593/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15367152","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Learning to Log: Helping Developers Make Informed Logging Decisions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to Log: Helping Developers Make Informed Logging Decisions","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1934a415.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092562S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174815","isNumber":"7194545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174815","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7194545","articleId":"7194593","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-01"},{"_id":7194603,"authors":[{"name":"Daming Zou","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Peking University, MoE, China"],"firstName":"Daming","lastName":"Zou","id":"37085562262"},{"name":"Ran Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Peking University, MoE, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085554557"},{"name":"Yingfei Xiong","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Peking University, MoE, China"],"firstName":"Yingfei","lastName":"Xiong","id":"37085346278"},{"name":"Lu Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Peking University, MoE, China"],"firstName":"Lu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37280173200"},{"name":"Zhendong Su","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of California, Davis, USA"],"firstName":"Zhendong","lastName":"Su","id":"37268427100"},{"name":"Hong Mei","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of High Confidence Software Technologies (Peking University), Peking University, MoE, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Mei","id":"37272773400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-1934-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0270-5257"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1225"}],"articleNumber":"7194603","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194603","abstract":"It is well-known that using floating-point numbers may inevitably result in inaccurate results and sometimes even cause serious software failures. Safety-critical software often has strict requirements on the upper bound of inaccuracy, and a crucial task in testing is to check whether significant inaccuracies may be produced. The main existing approach to the floating-point inaccuracy problem is error analysis, which produces an upper bound of inaccuracies that may occur. However, a high upper bound does not guarantee the existence of inaccuracy defects, nor does it give developers any concrete test inputs for debugging. In this paper, we propose the first metaheuristic search-based approach to automatically generating test inputs that aim to trigger significant inaccuracies in floating-point programs. Our approach is based on the following two insights: (1) with FPDebug, a recently proposed dynamic analysis approach, we can build a reliable fitness function to guide the search; (2) two main factors - the scales of exponents and the bit formations of significands - may have significant impact on the accuracy of the output, but in largely different ways. We have implemented and evaluated our approach over 154 real-world floating-point functions. The results show that our approach can detect significant inaccuracies in the subjects.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2015.70","startPage":"529","endPage":"539","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174815/7194545/07194603.pdf","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2015.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for Detecting Significant Floating-Point Inaccuracies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Sociology","Statistics","Algorithm design and analysis","Accuracy","Search problems","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["floating point arithmetic","genetic algorithms","program debugging","search problems","system monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","floating-point inaccuracy detection","floating-point numbers","software failures","safety-critical software","floating-point inaccuracy problem","error analysis","debugging","metaheuristic search-based approach","floating-point programs","FPDebug","dynamic analysis approach","fitness function"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Genetic Algorithm for Detecting Significant Floating-Point Inaccuracies","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7194603/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2015","accessionNumber":"15367146","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Genetic Algorithm for Detecting Significant Floating-Point Inaccuracies","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1934a529.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099483S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174815","isNumber":"7194545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174815","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7194545","articleId":"7194603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7194632,"authors":[{"name":"Anh Tuan Nguyen","affiliation":["Iowa State University, USA"],"firstName":"Anh Tuan","lastName":"Nguyen","id":"38181758500"},{"name":"Tien N.

However, the approaches using n-gram face challenges in capturing the patterns at higher levels of abstraction due to the mismatch between the sequence nature in n-grams and the structure nature of syntax and semantics in source code. This paper presents GraLan, a graph-based statistical language model and its application in code suggestion. GraLan can learn from a source code corpus and compute the appearance probabilities of any graphs given the observed (sub)graphs. We use GraLan to develop an API suggestion engine and an AST-based language model, ASTLan. ASTLan supports the suggestion of the next valid syntactic template and the detection of common syntactic templates. Our empirical evaluation on a large corpus of open-source projects has shown that our engine is more accurate in API code suggestion than the state-of-the-art approaches, and in 75% of the cases, it can correctly suggest the API with only five candidates. ASTLan has also high accuracy in suggesting the next syntactic template and is able to detect many useful and common syntactic templates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Graph-Based Statistical Language Model for Code","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2015.336","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174815/7194545/07194632.pdf","startPage":"858","endPage":"868","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2015.336","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194545","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194632/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2015","displayDocTitle":"Graph-Based Statistical Language Model for Code","conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7194632/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15367130","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Graph-Based Statistical Language Model for Code","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1934a858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104964S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174815","isNumber":"7194545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174815","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"7194545","articleId":"7194632","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7194633,"authors":[{"name":"Gayane Petrosyan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Gayane","lastName":"Petrosyan","id":"37085590632"},{"name":"Martin P.

To reduce such loss, developers devote substantial efforts to fixing bugs, which generally requires much expertise and experience. Various approaches have been proposed to aid debugging. An interesting recent research direction is automatic program repair, which achieves promising results, and attracts much academic and industrial attention. However, people also cast doubt on the effectiveness and promise of this direction. A key criticism is to what extent such approaches can fix real bugs. As only research prototypes for these approaches are available, it is infeasible to address the criticism by evaluating them directly on real bugs. Instead, in this paper, we design and develop BUGSTAT, a tool that extracts and analyzes bug fixes. With BUGSTAT's support, we conduct an empirical study on more than 9,000 real-world bug fixes from six popular Java projects. Comparing the nature of manual fixes with automatic program repair, we distill 15 findings, which are further summarized into four insights on the two key ingredients of automatic program repair: fault localization and faulty code fix. In addition, we provide indirect evidence on the size of the search space to fix real bugs and find that bugs may also reside in non-source files. Our results provide useful guidance and insights for improving the state-of-the-art of automatic program repair.","doi":"10.1109/ICSE.2015.101","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 37th IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/7174815/7194545/07194637.pdf","startPage":"913","endPage":"923","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSE.2015.101","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194545","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Empirical Study on Real Bug Fixes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194637","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-24 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194637/","displayDocTitle":"An Empirical Study on Real Bug Fixes","volume":"1","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15367110","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194637/","conferenceDate":"16-24 May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Empirical Study on Real Bug Fixes","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"1934a913.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110493S","chronDate":"16-24 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7174815","isNumber":"7194545","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7174815","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7194545","articleId":"7194637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7194671,"authors":[{"name":"Zack Coker","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Zack","lastName":"Coker","id":"37075315400"},{"name":"David Garlan","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Garlan","id":"37085543674"},{"name":"Claire Le Goues","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA"],"firstName":"Claire Le","lastName":"Goues","id":"37312555900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-5567-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-9475-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-2305"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-2321"}],"articleNumber":"7194671","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194671","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Time factors","Search problems","Measurement","Databases","Genetic algorithms","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","search problems","software engineering","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SASS","self-adaptation-using-stochastic search","complex search space","self-adaptive planning techniques","research community","hill climbing","genetic algorithms","randomness","multidimensional search spaces","search-based planning prototype technique","plan generation techniques","domain specific knowledge improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["planning","stochastic search","genetic algorithm","position paper"]}],"doi":"10.1109/SEAMS.2015.16","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 10th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE/ACM 10th International Symposium on Software Engineering for Adaptive and Self-Managing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7181771/7194643/07194671.pdf","startPage":"168","endPage":"174","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SEAMS.2015.16","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7194643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SASS: Self-Adaptation Using Stochastic Search","abstract":"Future-generation self-adaptive systems will need to be able to optimize for multiple interrelated, difficult-to-measure, and evolving quality properties. To navigate this complex search space, current self-adaptive planning techniques need to be improved. In this position paper, we argue that the research community should more directly pursue the application of stochastic search techniques -- search techniques, such as hill climbing or genetic algorithms, that incorporate an element of randomness -- to self-adaptive systems research. These techniques are well-suited to handling multi-dimensional search spaces and complex problems, situations which arise often for self-adaptive systems. We believe that recent advances in both fields make this a particularly promising research trajectory. We demonstrate one way to apply some of these advances in a search-based planning prototype technique to illustrate both the feasibility and the potential of the proposed research. This strategy informs a number of potentially interesting research directions and problems. In the long term, this general technique could enable sophisticated plan generation techniques that improve domain specific knowledge, decrease human effort, and increase the application of self-adaptive systems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-19 May 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194671/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"15399545","publicationDate":"May 2015","conferenceDate":"18-19 May 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194671/","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SASS: Self-Adaptation Using Stochastic Search","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SASS: Self-Adaptation Using Stochastic Search","confLoc":"Florence, Italy","sourcePdf":"5567a168.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067107S","chronDate":"18-19 May 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7181771","isNumber":"7194643","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7181771","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7194643","articleId":"7194671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7194734,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew R.

Remote sensing acquisitions can be done by both active (synthetic aperture radar, LiDAR) and passive (optical and thermal range, multispectral and hyperspectral) devices. According to the sensor, a variety of information about the Earth's surface can be obtained. The data acquired by these sensors can provide information about the structure (optical, synthetic aperture radar), elevation (LiDAR), and material content (multispectral and hyperspectral) of the objects in the image. Once considered together their complementarity can be helpful for characterizing land use (urban analysis, precision agriculture), damage detection (e.g., in natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, oil spills in seas), and give insights to potential exploitation of resources (oil fields, minerals). In addition, repeated acquisitions of a scene at different times allows one to monitor natural resources and environmental variables (vegetation phenology, snow cover), anthropological effects (urban sprawl, deforestation), climate changes (desertification, coastal erosion), among others. In this paper, we sketch the current opportunities and challenges related to the exploitation of multimodal data for Earth observation. This is done by leveraging the outcomes of the data fusion contests, organized by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society since 2006. We will report on the outcomes of these contests, presenting the multimodal sets of data made available to the community each year, the targeted applications, and an analysis of the submitted methods and results: How was multimodality considered and integrated in the processing chain? What were the improvements/new opportunities offered by the fusion? What were the objectives to be addressed and the reported solutions?

We also discuss some of the challenges and report on approaches to address them. One important issue in AV fusion is how the modalities interact and influence each other. This review will address this question in the context of AV speech processing, and especially speech recognition, where one of the issues is that the modalities both interact but also sometimes appear to desynchronize from each other. An additional issue that sometimes arises is that one of the modalities may be missing at test time, although it is available at training time; for example, it may be possible to collect AV training data while only having access to audio at test time. We will review approaches to address this issue from the area of multiview learning, where the goal is to learn a model or representation for each of the modalities separately while taking advantage of the rich multimodal training data. In addition to multiview learning, we also discuss the recent application of deep learning (DL) toward AV fusion. We finally draw conclusions and offer our assessment of the future in the area of AV fusion.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2015.2459017","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel7/5/7214335/07194741.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2015.2459017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7214335","startPage":"1635","endPage":"1653","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Audiovisual Fusion: Challenges and New Approaches","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194741","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Audiovisual Fusion: Challenges and New Approaches","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194741/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"103","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15383207","dateOfInsertion":"20 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7194741/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000015","fundingName":"U.S. Department of Energy","grantNumber":"DE-NA0002520"},{"fundingName":"Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Audiovisual Fusion: Challenges and New Approaches","sourcePdf":"jproc-katsaggelos-2459017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.222144S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"7214335","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7214335","articleId":"7194741","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7194744,"authors":[{"name":"Can Ye","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA","Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Science, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal"],"bio":{"p":["Authors\u2019 photographs and biographies not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Can","lastName":"Ye","id":"37597374500"},{"name":"B.V.

A multiview learning approach is proposed to automate subject adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled personal data, without requiring manual labeling. The designed subject-customized models consist of two models, namely, general classification model and specific classification model. The general model is trained using similar subjects out of a population dataset, where a pattern matching based algorithm is developed to select the subjects that are \u201csimilar\u201d to the particular test subject for model training. In contrast, the specific model is trained mainly on a small amount of high-confidence personal dataset, resulting from multiview-based learning. The learned general model represents the population knowledge, providing an interperson perspective for classification, while the specific model corresponds to the specific knowledge of the subject, offering an intraperson perspective for classification. The two models supplement each other and are combined to achieve improved personalized ECG analysis. The proposed methods have been validated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, yielding an average classification accuracy of 99.4% for ventricular ectopic beat class and 98.3% for supraventricular ectopic beat class, which corresponds to a significant improvement over other published results.","doi":"10.1109/JBHI.2015.2468224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221020/7775117/07194744.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2015.2468224","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7775117","startPage":"1485","endPage":"1492","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Automatic Subject-Adaptable Heartbeat Classifier Based on Multiview Learning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An Automatic Subject-Adaptable Heartbeat Classifier Based on Multiview Learning","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194744/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Nov. 2016","accessionNumber":"16521099","pubMedId":"26285228","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/7194744/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"SFRH/BD/33519/2008"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Automatic Subject-Adaptable Heartbeat Classifier Based on Multiview Learning","sourcePdf":"jbhi-ye-2468224-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074272S","chronDate":"Nov.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221020","isNumber":"7775117","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221020","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7775117","articleId":"7194744","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7194753,"authors":[{"name":"Maximilian Matth\u00e9","affiliation":["Vodafone Chair Mobile Communication Systems, Technische Universit\u00e4t, Dresden, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/7328780/7194753/matth-2468228_print-small.gif","p":["\nMaximilian Matth\u00e9 received the Dipl.-Ing degree in electrical engineering from Technical University Dresden (TU Dresden), Dresden, Germany, in 2013.

We found that the resistance window, the set/reset variability, and the endurance are all controlled by the maximum voltage V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">stop</sub>\n, which is applied during the negative-reset operation. We demonstrate that the endurance failure is triggered by a negative-set event, where the resistance suddenly decreases during the reset. Cycling endurance is studied as a function of time, compliance current and V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">stop</sub>\n, allowing to develop an Arrhenius-law model, which is capable of predicting device lifetime under various conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resistance","Integrated circuits","Transistors","Switches","Electrical resistance measurement","Logic gates","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hafnium compounds","resistive RAM","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resistive switching memory","RRAM","voltage controlled cycling endurance","metal oxide","nonvolatile storage memory","storage-class memory","switching variability","pulsed regime","resistance window","set-reset variability","negative-reset operation","negative-set event","Arrhenius-law model","HfOx"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cycling endurance","device modeling","memory reliability","resistive-switching memory (RRAM)."]},{"kwd":["Cycling endurance","device modeling","memory reliability","resistive-switching memory (RRAM)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194757","doi":"10.1109/TED.2015.2463104","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7272173/07194757.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2015.2463104","startPage":"3365","endPage":"3372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7272173","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage-Controlled Cycling Endurance of HfO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-Based Resistive-Switching Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Voltage-Controlled Cycling Endurance of HfO<sub><i>x</i></sub>-Based Resistive-Switching Memory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194757/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","volume":"62","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/7194757/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"18 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15457282","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage-Controlled Cycling Endurance of HfO<sub><italic>x</italic></sub>-Based Resistive-Switching Memory","sourcePdf":"ted-ielmini-2463104-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06904S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7272173","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"7272173","articleId":"7194757","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7194774,"authors":[{"name":"Po-Sen Huang","affiliation":["Clarifai, New York, NY","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6570655/7243388/7194774/7194774-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Po-Sen Huang is a Research Scientist at Clarifai.

It is challenging because, with only a single channel of information available, without any constraints, an infinite number of solutions are possible. In this paper, we explore joint optimization of masking functions and deep recurrent neural networks for monaural source separation tasks, including speech separation, singing voice separation, and speech denoising. The joint optimization of the deep recurrent neural networks with an extra masking layer enforces a reconstruction constraint. Moreover, we explore a discriminative criterion for training neural networks to further enhance the separation performance. We evaluate the proposed system on the TSP, MIR-1K, and TIMIT datasets for speech separation, singing voice separation, and speech denoising tasks, respectively.

Each source, which has no embedded power supply, first harvests energy from its associated AP and/or the PB in the downlink (DL) and then uses the harvested energy to transmit information to its AP in the uplink (UL). We consider both cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios based on whether the PB is cooperative with the APs or not. For the cooperative scenario, we formulate a social welfare maximization problem to maximize the weighted sum-throughput of all AP-source pairs, which is subsequently solved by a water-filling based distributed algorithm. In the non-cooperative scenario, all the APs and the PB are assumed to be rational and self-interested such that incentives from each AP are needed for the PB to provide wireless charging service. We then formulate an auction game and propose an auction based distributed algorithm by considering the PB as the auctioneer and the APs as the bidders. Finally, numerical results are performed to validate the convergence of both the proposed algorithms and demonstrate the impacts of various system parameters.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2468215","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/7299336/07194776.pdf","startPage":"3569","endPage":"3583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2015.2468215","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299336","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed and Optimal Resource Allocation for Power Beacon-Assisted Wireless-Powered Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194776","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194776/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed and Optimal Resource Allocation for Power Beacon-Assisted Wireless-Powered Communications","volume":"63","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524627","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194776/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"China Scholarship Council and Norman I Price Supplementary Scholarship"},{"fundingName":"International Postgraduate Research Scholarship (IPRS) and Australian Postgraduate Award (APA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed and Optimal Resource Allocation for Power Beacon-Assisted Wireless-Powered Communications","sourcePdf":"tcomm-chen-2468215-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114668S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"7299336","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"7299336","articleId":"7194776","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7194785,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Ding","affiliation":["Device Modeling Group, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Ding","id":"37085357725"},{"name":"Dave Reid","affiliation":["Gold Standard Simulations Ltd., Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Dave","lastName":"Reid","id":"37403800300"},{"name":"Plamen Asenov","affiliation":["ARM Ltd., Cambridge, U.K."],"firstName":"Plamen","lastName":"Asenov","id":"38512289600"},{"name":"Campbell Millar","affiliation":["Gold Standard Simulations Ltd., Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Campbell","lastName":"Millar","id":"37408074700"},{"name":"Asen Asenov","affiliation":["Gold Standard Simulations Ltd., Glasgow, U.K.","Device Modeling Group, School of Engineering, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, U.K."],"firstName":"Asen","lastName":"Asenov","id":"37268766900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9383"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9646"}],"articleNumber":"7194785","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Electron Devices Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/eds/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transistors","Aging","Random access memory","Degradation","Integrated circuit modeling","Inverters","Semiconductor device modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS memory circuits","SRAM chips","technology CAD (electronics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BTI-induced aging","SRAM write performance","static random access memory","temporal degradation effects","bias temperature instability induced transistor degradation","statistical compact model extraction","size 20 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aging","bulk CMOS","compact models","static random access memory (SRAM)","statistical variability","TCAD","write margin (WM)."]},{"kwd":["Aging","bulk CMOS","compact models","static random access memory (SRAM)","statistical variability","TCAD","write margin (WM)"]}],"abstract":"Write time is a critical component of memory performance, which often defines cycle time.

This paper investigates the influence of bias temperature instability induced transistor degradation on a dynamic write performance of 20 nm bulk CMOS SRAM. The circuit simulations are based on the comprehensive physical simulation of the aging process and on a very accurate statistical compact model extraction and generation technology. Several scenarios, which differ based on aging pattern of the cell, are investigated to identify the most important transistors and the corresponding critical aging conditions. Mismatch between the two inverters results in an imbalance of the cell, which enlarges the difference in write time between 0 and 1.

First, the initial population is divided into feasible nondominated population and infeasible/dominated population. The feasible nondominated individuals focus on exploring the nondominated front through clone and hypermutation based on a proposed affinity design approach, while the infeasible/dominated individuals are exploited and improved via the simulated binary crossover and polynomial mutation operations. And then, to accelerate the convergence of the proposed algorithm, a transformation technique is applied to the combined population of the above two offspring populations. Finally, a crowded-comparison strategy is used to create the next generation population. In numerical experiments, a series of benchmark constrained multiobjective optimization problems are considered to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and it is also compared to several state-of-art algorithms in terms of the inverted generational distance and hypervolume indicators. The results indicate that the new method achieves competitive performance and even statistically significant better results than previous algorithms do on most of the benchmark suite.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7542212/07194788.pdf","startPage":"2056","endPage":"2069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm Based on Immune System Model","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2015.2461651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7542212","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2015.2461651","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194788","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194788/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm Based on Immune System Model","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231735","pubMedId":"26285230","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"46","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7194788/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61304146 and 61473145"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Internet of Things and Control Technologies (Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics)"},{"fundingName":"Provincial Science and Technology Foundation of Guizhou of China","grantNumber":"20152002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constrained Multiobjective Optimization Algorithm Based on Immune System Model","sourcePdf":"tcyb-qian-2461651-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117398S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7542212","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"7542212","articleId":"7194788","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":7194793,"authors":[{"name":"Avimanyu Sahoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7543555/7194793/sahoo-2453320-small.gif","p":["Avimanyu Sahoo received the B.S. degree in electrical technology from the Cochin University of Science and Technology, Cochin, India, in 2008, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from IIT Varanasi, Varanasi, India, in 2011.

Event-driven neurodynamic programming (NDP) is utilized to design the control policy. A neural network (NN)-based identifier, with event-based state and input vectors, is utilized to learn the system dynamics. An actor-critic framework is used to learn the cost function and the optimal control input. The NN weights of the identifier, the critic, and the actor NNs are tuned aperiodically once every triggered instant. An adaptive event-trigger condition to decide the trigger instants is derived. Thus, a suitable number of events are generated to ensure a desired accuracy of approximation. A near optimal performance is achieved without using value and/or policy iterations. A detailed analysis of nontrivial inter-event times with an explicit formula to show the reduction in computation is also derived. The Lyapunov technique is used in conjunction with the event-trigger condition to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system. The simulation results are included to verify the performance of the controller. The net result is the development of event-driven NDP.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2453320","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7543555/07194793.pdf","startPage":"1801","endPage":"1815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2453320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7543555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near Optimal Event-Triggered Control of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems Using Neurodynamic Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194793","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/5962385/7543555/7194793-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194793/","displayDocTitle":"Near Optimal Event-Triggered Control of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems Using Neurodynamic Programming","volume":"27","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231708","pubMedId":"26285220","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194793/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007165","fundingName":"Intelligent Systems Center, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS 1406533"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Near Optimal Event-Triggered Control of Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems Using Neurodynamic Programming","sourcePdf":"tnnls-sahoo-2453320-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111624S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7543555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"82","xplore-issue":"7543555","articleId":"7194793","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-29"},{"_id":7194796,"authors":[{"name":"Felix Juefei-Xu","affiliation":["CyLab Biometrics Center, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/7271151/7194796/juefe-2468173-small.gif","p":["Felix Juefei-Xu (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering.

Our Spartans framework starts by utilizing one single sample per subject class, and generate new face images under a wide range of 3D rotations using the 3D generic elastic model which is both accurate and computationally economic. Then, we focus on the periocular region where the most stable and discriminant features on human faces are retained, and marginalize out the regions beyond the periocular region since they are more susceptible to expression variations and occlusions. A novel facial descriptor, high-dimensional Walsh local binary patterns, is uniformly sampled on facial images with robustness toward alignment. During the learning stage, subject-dependent advanced correlation filters are learned for pose-tolerant non-linear subspace modeling in kernel feature space followed by a coupled max-pooling mechanism which further improve the performance. Given any unconstrained unseen face image, the Spartans can produce a highly discriminative matching score, thus achieving high verification rate. We have evaluated our method on the challenging Labeled Faces in the Wild database and solidly outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithms under four evaluation protocols with a high accuracy of 89.69%, a top score among image-restricted and unsupervised protocols. The advancement of Spartans is also proven in the Face Recognition Grand Challenge and Multi-PIE databases. In addition, our learning method based on advanced correlation filters is much more effective, in terms of learning subject-dependent pose-tolerant subspaces, compared with many well-established subspace methods in both linear and non-linear cases.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2468173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2468173","startPage":"4780","endPage":"4795","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07194796.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"<i>Spartans</i>: Single-Sample Periocular-Based Alignment-Robust Recognition Technique Applied to Non-Frontal Scenarios","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","displayDocTitle":"<i>Spartans</i>: Single-Sample Periocular-Based Alignment-Robust Recognition Technique Applied to Non-Frontal Scenarios","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","volume":"24","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194796/","accessionNumber":"15457321","pubMedId":"26285149","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194796/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"<italic>Spartans</italic>: Single-Sample Periocular-Based Alignment-Robust Recognition Technique Applied to Non-Frontal Scenarios","sourcePdf":"tip-juefeixu-2468173-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129347S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7194796","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7194798,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed Rubaai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Howard University, Washington, DC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/28/7384815/7194798/rubaa-2468191-small.gif","p":["\n\nAhmed Rubaai (S'88\u2013M'88\u2013SM'03\u2013F'15) received the \nM.S.E.E. degree from Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, USA, in 1983 and the Dr.Eng. degree from Cleveland \nState University, Cleveland, in 1988.","In 1988, he joined Howard University, Washington, DC, USA, as a Faculty Member, where he is currently a Professor of \nelectrical engineering.

The FNN combines fuzzy logic (FL) with the learning capabilities of an artificial neural network. The study designs an FNN structure and defines four different training algorithms for the FNN, namely, backpropagation (BP), extended Kalman filter (EKF), genetic (GEN), and particle swarm optimization (PSO). These algorithms are examined in the simple application of pattern matching an input set to an output set and determine the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. Tests of each learning algorithm by a pattern matching benchmark are achieved via dSPACE DSP MATLAB/Simulink environment and allows for the capability for adaptive self-tuning of the weights and memberships of the input parameters. Thus, this adds a self-learning capability to the initial fuzzy design for operational adaptively and implements the solution on real hardware using a BLDC motor drive system. The success of the adaptive FNN-controlled BLDC motor drive system is verified by experimental results. Testing results show that the EKF method is the superior method of the four for this specific application. The BP method was also somewhat successful, nearly matching the pattern but not to the accuracy of the EKF. The GEN and PSO methods did not demonstrate success. Demonstrating the proposed self-learning FNN control on real hardware realizes the solution.","doi":"10.1109/TIA.2015.2468191","startPage":"414","endPage":"424","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/28/7384815/07194798.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIA.2015.2468191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7384815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware/Software Implementation of Fuzzy-Neural-Network Self-Learning Control Methods for Brushless DC Motor Drives","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Fuzzy neural networks","Training","Fuzzy logic","Pattern matching","Algorithm design and analysis","Boards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","brushless DC motors","DC motor drives","fuzzy control","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","Kalman filters","machine control","neural nets","nonlinear filters","particle swarm optimisation","pattern matching","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy-neural-network self-learning control methods","FNN learning control methods","brushless DC motor drives","adaptive FNN-controlled BLDC motor drive system","fuzzy logic","artificial neural network","backpropagation","BP method","extended Kalman filter","EKF method","genetic algorithm","GEN methods","particle swarm optimization","PSO methods","pattern matching","learning algorithm","dSPACE DSP MATLAB-Simulink environment","adaptive self-tuning","fuzzy design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Learning methods","FNN","real-time control","MATLAB/Simulink","industrial drives"]},{"kwd":["Fuzzy neural network (FNN)","industrial drives","learning methods","MATLAB/Simulink","real-time control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Hardware/Software Implementation of Fuzzy-Neural-Network Self-Learning Control Methods for Brushless DC Motor Drives","volume":"52","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/7194798/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"18 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15720381","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware/Software Implementation of Fuzzy-Neural-Network Self-Learning Control Methods for Brushless DC Motor Drives","sourcePdf":"tia-rubaai-2468191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071708S","chronDate":"Jan.-Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7384815","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7384815","articleId":"7194798","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7194802,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9dric F\u00e9votte","affiliation":["Laboratoire Lagrange, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Observatoire de la C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, Universit\u00e9 Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France"],"bio":{"p":["C\u00e9dric F\u00e9votte received the Ph.D. degree from the Ecole Centrale de Nantes.

The new model extends the commonly used linear mixing model by introducing an additional term accounting for possible nonlinear effects, that are treated as sparsely distributed additive outliers. With the standard nonnegativity and sum-to-one constraints inherent to spectral unmixing, our model leads to a new form of robust nonnegative matrix factorization with a group-sparse outlier term. The factorization is posed as an optimization problem, which is addressed with a block-coordinate descent algorithm involving majorization-minimization updates. Simulation results obtained on synthetic and real data show that the proposed strategy competes with the state-of-the-art linear and nonlinear unmixing methods.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/7271151/07194802.pdf","startPage":"4810","endPage":"4819","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2015.2468177","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2015.2468177","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7271151","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194802","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear Hyperspectral Unmixing With Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Hyperspectral imaging","Linear programming","Optimization","Extraterrestrial measurements","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geophysical image processing","group theory","hyperspectral imaging","matrix decomposition","minimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear hyperspectral unmixing method","robust nonnegative matrix factorization","robust mixing model","hyperspectral data","spectral signatures","sparsely distributed additive outliers","group-sparse outlier term","block-coordinate descent algorithm","majorization-minimization updates"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hyperspectral imagery","nonlinear unmixing","robust nonnegative matrix factorization","group-sparsity"]},{"kwd":["Hyperspectral imagery","nonlinear unmixing","robust nonnegative matrix factorization","group-sparsity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194802/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear Hyperspectral Unmixing With Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","volume":"24","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/7194802/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2015","accessionNumber":"15457331","pubMedId":"26285151","dateOfInsertion":"17 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique through the PEPS Project ESTOMAT"},{"fundingName":"Agence Nationale de la Recherche Hypanema","grantNumber":"ANR-12-BS03-003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear Hyperspectral Unmixing With Robust Nonnegative Matrix Factorization","sourcePdf":"tip-fevotte-2468177-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.197322S","chronDate":"Dec.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"7271151","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"94","xplore-issue":"7271151","articleId":"7194802","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7194813,"authors":[{"name":"Jef Beerten","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), University of Leuven (KU Leuven), Leuven-Heverlee, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/7438949/7194813/7194813-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jef Beerten (S\u201907\u2013M\u201913) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Leuven (KU Leuven), Leuven, Belgium, in 2008 and 2013, respectively.","In 2011, he was a Visiting Researcher at the EPS Group, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, for three months.

Moreover, interactions between converters are largely influenced by the control parameters and, in general, an a priori identification of interaction modes based on associated time constants is less straightforward than in ac systems. Furthermore, the extent to which converters interact not only depends on the controller parameters, but is also influenced by the physical characteristics of the HVDC system. The methodology introduced in this paper is based on aggregated participation factors to distinguish between local modes, primarily associated with one terminal, and interaction modes involving multiple terminals.

In this paper, we model user-item interactions over time using a tensor that has time as a dimension (mode). To account for the fact that user preferences change individually, we propose a new measure of user-preference dynamics (UPD) that captures the rate with which the current preferences of each user have been shifted. UPD shows the variability in how users interact with items in recommender systems. We generate recommendations based on a tensor factorization technique, where the importance of past user preferences are weighted according to their UPD values, that is, higher UPD values downweigh more past user preferences. Additionally, we exploit users' side data, such as demographics, which improve the accuracy of recommendations based on a coupled tensor-matrix factorization scheme. Our empirical evaluation uses two real benchmark datasets from the social media platforms Last.fm and MovieLens, containing users' history records pertaining to listening to songs and viewing movies, respectively. We demonstrate that in both datasets, there are users with a varying level of dynamics, expressed by the UPD metric. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baselines, by taking into account both dynamics and side data of users.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221021/7469897/07194815.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"792","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems","doi":"10.1109/TSMC.2015.2460691","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMC.2015.2460691","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7469897","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194815","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling Users Preference Dynamics and Side Information in Recommender Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tensile stress","Recommender systems","Motion pictures","Optimization","Approximation methods","Collaboration","Music"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["collaborative filtering","matrix decomposition","modelling","recommender systems","tensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user preference dynamic modelling","UPD modelling","user side information modelling","recommender system","tensor-matrix factorization scheme","collaborative filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupled tensor factorization (CTF)","recommender systems","users' dynamics"]},{"kwd":["Coupled tensor factorization (CTF)","recommender systems","users\u2019 dynamics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194815/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Modeling Users Preference Dynamics and Side Information in Recommender Systems","volume":"46","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/7194815/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15989051","dateOfInsertion":"13 May 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling Users Preference Dynamics and Side Information in Recommender Systems","sourcePdf":"tsmc-rafailidis-2460691-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085996S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"6221021","isNumber":"7469897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221021","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"7469897","articleId":"7194815","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7194816,"authors":[{"name":"Mircea-Bogdan Radac","affiliation":["Department of Automation and Applied Informatics, Politehnica University of Timi\u015foara, Timi\u015foara, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7299729/7194816/radac-2460258-small.gif","p":["Mircea-Bogdan Radac (M\u201912) received the Dipl.-Ing. degree in systems and computer engineering and the Ph.D. degree in systems engineering from the Politehnica University of Timi\u015foara, Timi\u015foara, Romania, in 2008 and 2011, respectively.","He is currently with the Politehnica University of Timi\u015foara, where he became a Lecturer with the Department of Automation and Applied Informatics in 2014.

The optimal trajectory tracking solution is obtained in terms of previously learned solutions to simple tasks called primitives. The library of primitives that are stored in memory consists of pairs of reference input/controlled output signals. The reference input primitives are optimized in a model-free ILC framework without using knowledge of the controlled process. The guaranteed convergence of the learning scheme is built upon a model-free virtual reference feedback tuning design of the feedback decoupling controller. Each new complex trajectory to be tracked is decomposed into the output primitives regarded as basis functions. The optimal reference input for the control system to track the desired trajectory is next recomposed from the reference input primitives. This is advantageous because the optimal reference input is computed straightforward without the need to learn from repeated executions of the tracking task. In addition, the optimization problem specific to trajectory tracking of square MIMO systems is decomposed in a set of optimization problems assigned to each separate single-input single-output control channel that ensures a convenient model-free decoupling. The new model-free primitive-based ILC approach is capable of planning, reasoning, and learning. A case study dealing with the model-free control tuning for a nonlinear aerodynamic system is included to validate the new approach. The experimental results are given.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Model-Free Primitive-Based Iterative Learning Control Approach to Trajectory Tracking of MIMO Systems With Experimental Validation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2460258","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7299729/07194816.pdf","startPage":"2925","endPage":"2938","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2460258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7299729","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194816","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194816/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Model-Free Primitive-Based Iterative Learning Control Approach to Trajectory Tracking of MIMO Systems With Experimental Validation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/7194816/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15524687","pubMedId":"26285221","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ministry of National Education, Romania, through the European Social Fund\u2013Investing in People, within the Sectoral Operational Program Human Resources Development from 2007 to 2013","grantNumber":"POSDRU/159/1.5/S/137070 (2014)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingName":"Romanian National Authority for Scientific Research, National Scientific Research Council\u2013Executive Unit for Financing Higher Education, Research, Development and Innovation","grantNumber":"PN-II-ID-PCE-2011-3-0109"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model-Free Primitive-Based Iterative Learning Control Approach to Trajectory Tracking of MIMO Systems With Experimental Validation","sourcePdf":"tnnls-precup-2460258-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127698S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7299729","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"7299729","articleId":"7194816","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7194819,"authors":[{"name":"Okko J.

Prediction based on sequence history is typically performed using parametric models, such as fixed-order Markov chains (n-grams), approximations of high-order Markov processes, such as mixed-order Markov models or mixtures of lagged bigram models, or with other machine learning techniques. This paper presents a method for sequence prediction based on sparse hyperdimensional coding of the sequence structure and describes how higher order temporal structures can be utilized in sparse coding in a balanced manner. The method is purely incremental, allowing real-time online learning and prediction with limited computational resources. Experiments with prediction of mobile phone use patterns, including the prediction of the next launched application, the next GPS location of the user, and the next artist played with the phone media player, reveal that the proposed method is able to capture the relevant variable-order structure from the sequences. In comparison with the n-grams and the mixed-order Markov models, the sparse hyperdimensional predictor clearly outperforms its peers in terms of unweighted average recall and achieves an equal level of weighted average recall as the mixed-order Markov chain but without the batch training of the mixed-order model.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Context","Markov processes","Encoding","Predictive models","Data models","History","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","human factors","learning (artificial intelligence)","Markov processes","mobile computing","mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse distributed hyperdimensional coding","mobile phone use pattern analysis","temporal sequence modeling","temporal sequence prediction","signal processing","machine learning","sequence history","parametric models","fixed-order Markov chains","n-grams","high-order Markov process approximation","mixed-order Markov models","lagged bigram models","sparse hyperdimensional coding","sequence structure","higher order temporal structures","real-time online learning","sparse hyperdimensional predictor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Machine learning","prediction methods","real-time systems","sequences","time series analysis"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194819","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2462721","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7543555/07194819.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2462721","startPage":"1878","endPage":"1889","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7543555","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sequence Prediction With Sparse Distributed Hyperdimensional Coding Applied to the Analysis of Mobile Phone Use Patterns","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sequence Prediction With Sparse Distributed Hyperdimensional Coding Applied to the Analysis of Mobile Phone Use Patterns","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194819/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","volume":"27","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7194819/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","accessionNumber":"16231714","pubMedId":"26285224","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003406","fundingName":"Tekes and Tivit Joint Program Data to Intelligence"},{"fundingName":"Academy of Finland"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sequence Prediction With Sparse Distributed Hyperdimensional Coding Applied to the Analysis of Mobile Phone Use Patterns","sourcePdf":"tnnls-rasanen-2462721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097007S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7543555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7543555","articleId":"7194819","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7194822,"authors":[{"name":"Yanjun Zhang","affiliation":["College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7543555/7194822/zhang-2461001-small.gif","p":["Yanjun Zhang received the B.S. degree in mathematics and applied mathematics and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Qufu Normal University, Qufu, China, in 2010 and 2013, respectively.

Unlike commonly studied canonical form nonlinear systems whose neural network approximation system models have explicit relative degree structures, which can directly be used to derive parameterized controllers for adaptation, noncanonical form nonlinear systems usually do not have explicit relative degrees, and thus their approximation system models are also in noncanonical forms. It is well-known that the adaptive control of noncanonical form nonlinear systems involves the parameterization of system dynamics. As demonstrated in this paper, it is also the case for noncanonical neural network approximation system models. Effective control of such systems is an open research problem, especially in the presence of uncertain parameters. This paper shows that it is necessary to reparameterize such neural network system models for adaptive control design, and that such reparameterization can be realized using a relative degree formulation, a concept yet to be studied for general neural network system models. This paper then derives the parameterized controllers that guarantee closed-loop stability and asymptotic output tracking for noncanonical form neural network system models. An illustrative example is presented with the simulation results to demonstrate the control design procedure, and to verify the effectiveness of such a new design method.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2461001","startPage":"1864","endPage":"1877","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7543555/07194822.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2015.2461001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7543555","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Based Control of Noncanonical Nonlinear Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Nonlinear systems","Neural networks","Adaptation models","Approximation methods","Adaptive systems","Control design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","approximation theory","closed loop systems","control system synthesis","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability","uncertain systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive neural network based control","noncanonical nonlinear systems","parametric uncertainties","parameterized controllers","adaptation system","noncanonical form nonlinear systems","system dynamics parameterization","noncanonical neural network approximation system models","uncertain parameters","adaptive control design","relative degree formulation","general neural network system models","closed-loop stability","asymptotic output tracking","noncanonical form neural network system models","control design procedure"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive control","feedback linearization","neural network system models","noncanonical nonlinear systems","output tracking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194822/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2016","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Neural Network Based Control of Noncanonical Nonlinear Systems","volume":"27","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/7194822/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"16231713","pubMedId":"26285223","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002851","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61374130"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004608","fundingName":"Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"SBK20130033"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004602","fundingName":"Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University of China","grantNumber":"NCET-11-0830"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Neural Network Based Control of Noncanonical Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tnnls-zhang-2461001-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167218S","chronDate":"Sept.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7543555","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"7543555","articleId":"7194822","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":7194828,"authors":[{"name":"Chenchen Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Institute of Wireless Communications Technology (IWCT), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7374774/7194828/cyang-2468220-small.gif","p":["Chenchen Yang received the B.Eng. degree from the School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU), Xi\u2019an, China, in 2013.

In this paper, we propose and analyze cache-based content delivery in a three-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet), where base stations (BSs), relays, and device-to-device (D2D) pairs are included. We advocate proactively caching popular content in the relays and parts of the users with caching ability when the network is off-peak. The cached content can be reused for frequent access to offload the cellular network traffic. The node locations are first modeled as mutually independent Poisson point processes (PPPs) and the corresponding content access protocol is developed. The average ergodic rate and outage probability in the downlink are then analyzed theoretically. We further derive the throughput and the delay based on the multiclass processor-sharing queue model and the continuous-time Markov process. According to the critical condition of the steady state in the HetNet, the maximum traffic load and the global throughput gain are investigated. Moreover, impacts of some key network characteristics, e.g., the heterogeneity of multimedia contents, node densities, and the limited caching capacities, on the system performance are elaborated on to provide valuable insight.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2015.2468220","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2015.2468220","startPage":"131","endPage":"145","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7374774/07194828.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374774","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis on Cache-Enabled Wireless Heterogeneous Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Analysis on Cache-Enabled Wireless Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"15","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","accessionNumber":"15697438","publicationDate":"Jan. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/7194828/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61301115 and 61528103"},{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"863 5G and 2014AA01A702"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis on Cache-Enabled Wireless Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"twc-xia-2468220-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103629S","chronDate":"Jan.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7374774","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"228","xplore-issue":"7374774","articleId":"7194828","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-22"},{"_id":7194832,"authors":[{"name":"Eric Alexander","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Alexander","id":"37085354962"},{"name":"Michael Gleicher","affiliation":["University of Wisconsin-Madison"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Gleicher","id":"37282585700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1077-2626"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0506"},{"format":"CD","value":"2160-9306"}],"articleNumber":"7194832","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":32,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1440},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org/"}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Task-Driven Comparison of Topic Models","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","pdfPath":"/iel7/2945/7307919/07194832.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7307919","doi":"10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467618","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Computational modeling","Encoding","Visualization","Color","Analytical models","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data visualisation","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document similarity","position encodings","color encodings","buddy plots","visualization techniques","understanding change","understanding similarity","understanding topics","task-centric topic model comparison","numerical metrics","text analysis","large text collection","thematic content extraction","topic modeling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Text visualization","topic modeling"]},{"kwd":["Text visualization","topic modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194832","abstract":"Topic modeling, a method of statistically extracting thematic content from a large collection of texts, is used for a wide variety of tasks within text analysis. Though there are a growing number of tools and techniques for exploring single models, comparisons between models are generally reduced to a small set of numerical metrics. These metrics may or may not reflect a model's performance on the analyst's intended task, and can therefore be insufficient to diagnose what causes differences between models. In this paper, we explore task-centric topic model comparison, considering how we can both provide detail for a more nuanced understanding of differences and address the wealth of tasks for which topic models are used. We derive comparison tasks from single-model uses of topic models, which predominantly fall into the categories of understanding topics, understanding similarity, and understanding change. Finally, we provide several visualization techniques that facilitate these tasks, including buddy plots, which combine color and position encodings to allow analysts to readily view changes in document similarity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194832/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"31 Jan. 2016","accessionNumber":"15568042","pubMedId":"26340780","htmlLink":"/document/7194832/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"22","issue":"1","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Task-Driven Comparison of Topic Models","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"IIS-1162037"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Task-Driven Comparison of Topic Models","sourcePdf":"22tvcg01-alexander4-2467618-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06855S","chronDate":"Jan. 31 2016","xplore-pub-id":"2945","isNumber":"7307919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2945","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7307919","articleId":"7194832","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7194833,"authors":[{"name":"Sarah Lyden","affiliation":["School of Engineering and ICT, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tas., Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/7374779/7194833/lyden-small.gif","p":["Sarah Lyden (S\u201912) received the Graduate degree with a\n B.Sc.-B.E.(Hons.) and the Ph.D. degree in engineering from the University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tas., Australia, in\n 2011 and 2015, respectively.","She is currently a Lecturer at the School of Engineering and ICT, University of Tasmania.

The proposed high-efficiency active rectifier with delay-locked loop (DLL) is a highly efficient receiver circuit intended for use in resonant wireless charging applications with a resonant frequency of 6.78 MHz. Each MOSFET of the proposed rectifier is turned on and off based on the ac input voltage. The delay between the ac input current and the ac input voltage due to the delays of internal blocks such as voltage limiter, level shifter, gate driver, and comparator will cause the reverse leakage current, degrading the power efficiency. Thus, the proposed active rectifier adopts the DLL to compensate for the delay caused by internal blocks, which leads to the removal of reverse leakage current and the power efficiency maximization. Moreover, to maximize power efficiency, negative impedance circuit (NIC) is also adopted to minimize switching loss. In the case of dc-dc converter, phase-locked loop is adopted for the constant switching frequency in process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variation to solve the efficiency reduction problem, especially by heat. This chip is implemented using 0.18 \u03bcm BCD technology with an active area of 3.5 mm \u00d7 3.5 mm. When the magnitude of the ac input voltage is 8.95 V, the maximum efficiencies of the proposed active rectifier and dc-dc converter are 91.5% and 92.7%, respectively. The range of ac input voltage is 3-20 V, and the efficiency of the WPRU is about 80.86%.","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2015.2468596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7374779","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2015.2468596","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/7374779/07194837.pdf","startPage":"4484","endPage":"4498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Design of a Wireless Power Receiving Unit With a High-Efficiency 6.78-MHz Active Rectifier Using Shared DLLs for Magnetic-Resonant A4 WP Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Design of a Wireless Power Receiving Unit With a High-Efficiency 6.78-MHz Active Rectifier Using Shared DLLs for Magnetic-Resonant A4 WP Applications","volume":"31","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2016","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2016","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194837/","publicationDate":"June 2016","accessionNumber":"15697275","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194837/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003725","fundingName":"National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingName":"Korean government (MSIP)","grantNumber":"2014R1A5A1011478"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Design of a Wireless Power Receiving Unit With a High-Efficiency 6.78-MHz Active Rectifier Using Shared DLLs for Magnetic-Resonant A4 WP Applications","sourcePdf":"tpel-lee-2468596-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071186S","chronDate":"June  2016","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"7374779","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"7374779","articleId":"7194837","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":7194841,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Wang","affiliation":["Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7513343/7194841/wang-2468079-small.gif","p":["Wei Wang (M'09) received the Bachelor's degree in communications engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2003; the Master's degree from the University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany, in 2006; and the Doctoral degree from the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany, in 2014.","Since 2007, he has been a Scientific Staff Member with the Institute of Communications and Navigation, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Wessling, Germany.

Multipath propagation significantly influences the ToA estimate, resulting in position errors. To mitigate these errors, the multipath channel needs to be accurately estimated, usually with a large number of known pilot symbols. A tradeoff between the data rate and the multipath channel estimation performance must be made for joint communication and positioning applications. This paper proposes a semiblind range tracking algorithm, which allows the reduction of the required number of pilot symbols significantly. For moving receivers, the algorithm needs, only in the beginning, an OFDM symbol with known pilot symbols, which increases the data rate dramatically. Instead of tracking the complex amplitude of individual subcarriers, the proposed algorithm directly tracks the multipath channel parameters, including the complex amplitude, delay, and angle of arrival (AoA) of individual multipath components. The estimated delay of the first arrived path, i.e., its ToA, is used to calculate the range between the transmitter and receiver antennas. Evaluations of the algorithm are provided by simulations in an artificial scenario and using channel sounder measurement data. The results show that the proposed tracking algorithm can effectively track the range between transmitter and receiver and detect the data.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2468079","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07194841.pdf","startPage":"5237","endPage":"5250","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2468079","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Semiblind Tracking Algorithm for Joint Communication and Ranging With OFDM Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194841","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194841/","displayDocTitle":"A Semiblind Tracking Algorithm for Joint Communication and Ranging With OFDM Signals","volume":"65","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141207","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7194841/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002946","fundingName":"German Aerospace Center (DLR) internal projects Galileo ADvanced APplications (GalileoADAP) and Dependable Navigation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Semiblind Tracking Algorithm for Joint Communication and Ranging With OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2468079-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100011S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7194841","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7194842,"authors":[{"name":"Lijuan Li","affiliation":["Tsinghua National Laboratory for Information Science and Technology, Institute of Microelectronics, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7194842/lli-2453360-small.gif","p":["Lijuan Li received the bachelor\u2019s degree from the School of Astronautics, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2011.

However, it may lose its interference-resistance feature and suffer performance degradation over asynchronous frequency-selective fading channels due to the fact that it is incapable of reconstructing ideal complementary cross-correlation functions at a receiver. Based on the analysis on combining and detection algorithms designed for CC-CDMA systems, this paper proposes a joint pre-equalization and adaptive combining scheme. Pre-equalization is used at a transmitter to either enhance diversity gain or compensate channel selectivity leveraged by a controlling parameter \u03b6, whereas a recursive least square (RLS) adaptive combining algorithm is employed at a receiver to determine the optimal combining coefficients, aiming at minimizing detection errors under different channel conditions. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of bit error rate (BER) and its adaptability to varying channel states.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7513343/07194849.pdf","startPage":"5175","endPage":"5184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2015.2467967","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2015.2467967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7513343","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7194849","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Pre-Equalization and Adaptive Combining for CC-CDMA Systems Over Asynchronous Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Fading","Diversity reception","Correlation","Uplink","Diversity methods","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","diversity reception","equalisers","error statistics","fading channels","frequency selective surfaces","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["preequalization","CC-CDMA systems","asynchronous frequency-selective fading channels","complementary codes","complementary coded code-division multiple-access system","interference-resistance capabilities","interference-resistance feature","performance degradation","cross-correlation functions","adaptive combining scheme","recursive least square adaptive combining algorithm","channel conditions","bit error rate","BER","varying channel states"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive receiver","code-division multiple access (CDMA)","complementary code (CC)","frequency-selective fading","pre-equalization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194849/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Pre-Equalization and Adaptive Combining for CC-CDMA Systems Over Asynchronous Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","volume":"65","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/7194849/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141198","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation General Program of China","grantNumber":"61501247 , 61471143 and 61401278"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) research project","grantNumber":"NSC99-2221-E-006-016-MY3 and 104-2221-E-006-081-MY2"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003848","fundingName":"Taiwan Industry Technology Research Institute (ITRI)","grantNumber":"M0-10309-6"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Pre-Equalization and Adaptive Combining for CC-CDMA Systems Over Asynchronous Frequency-Selective Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tvt-chen-2467967-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.096497S","chronDate":"July  2016","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7513343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7513343","articleId":"7194849","onlineDate":"13 August 2015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":7194850,"authors":[{"name":"Taehui Na","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7436835/7194850/na-2453192-small.gif","p":["Taehui Na (S\u201913) was born in Yesan, Korea, in 1986.

It describes the vulnerabilities, presents an evaluation methodology for the assessment of spoofing and countermeasures, and outlines research priorities for the future.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7192809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2015.2437652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/7192809/07194916.pdf","startPage":"20","endPage":"30","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2015.2437652","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Biometrics Systems Under Spoofing Attack: An evaluation methodology and lessons learned","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Biometrics Systems Under Spoofing Attack: An evaluation methodology and lessons learned","volume":"32","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/7194916/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15364463","dateOfInsertion":"13 August 2015","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7194916/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Biometrics Systems Under Spoofing Attack: An evaluation methodology and lessons learned","sourcePdf":"32msp05-hadid-2437652-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053304S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"7192809","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"104","xplore-issue":"7192809","articleId":"7194916","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-06"},{"_id":7195574,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Hu","affiliation":["Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Hu"},{"name":"Qimin Peng","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Integrated Information System, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qimin","lastName":"Peng","id":"37085356577"},{"name":"Xiaohui Hu","affiliation":["Science and Technology on Integrated Information System, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Hu","id":"37539265700"},{"name":"Rong Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Technology, Hubei University of Science and Technology, Xianning, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085422134"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7272-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7271-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7195574","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":20,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":576},"abstract":"Quality of Service (QoS) has been widely used for personalized Web service recommendation. Since QoS information usually cannot be predetermined, how to make personalized QoS prediction precisely becomes a challenge of Web service recommendation. Time series forecasting and collaborative filtering are two mainstream technologies for QoS prediction. However, on one hand, existing time series forecasting approaches based on Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models do not take the latest observation as a feedback to revise forecasts. Moreover, they only focus on predicting future QoS values for each individual Web service. Service users' personalized factors are not taken into account. On the other hand, collaborative filtering facilitates user-side personalized QoS evaluation, but rarely precisely models the temporal dynamics of QoS values. To address the limitations of existing QoS prediction methods, this paper proposes a novel personalized QoS prediction approach considering both the temporal dynamics of QoS attributes and the personalized factors of service users. Our approach seamlessly combines collaborative filtering with improved time series forecasting which uses Kalman filtering to compensate for shortcomings of ARIMA models. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of personalized QoS prediction significantly.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194373/7195533/07195574.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"240","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2015.40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2015.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195574","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Web Service Recommendation Based on Time Series Forecasting and Collaborative Filtering","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Web services","Predictive models","Time series analysis","Forecasting","Kalman filters","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","collaborative filtering","forecasting theory","Kalman filters","quality of service","recommender systems","time series","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series forecasting","collaborative filtering","quality of service","personalized Web service recommendation","personalized QoS prediction","autoregressive integrated moving average models","ARIMA models","user-side personalized QoS evaluation","Kalman filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Web service recommendation","QoS prediction","ARIMA","Kalman filtering","collaborative filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195574/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Web Service Recommendation Based on Time Series Forecasting and Collaborative Filtering","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7195574/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15367305","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Web Service Recommendation Based on Time Series Forecasting and Collaborative Filtering","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7272a233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.17052S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194373","isNumber":"7195533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194373","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7195533","articleId":"7195574","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-08"},{"_id":7195595,"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth K.

However, using these nonfunctional attribute values from invoked services alone in similarity computation for personalized service recommendation is not sufficient. This is because two users may invoke the same service, but their personalized preferences on nonfunctional attributes that describe the service may be different. Thus, to accurately personalize service recommendation, it is necessary for CF-based recommendation systems to incorporate users personalized preferences on nonfunctional attributes when recommending services to an active user. This paper proposes a CF-based service recommendation method that considers users' personalized preference on nonfunctional attributes. We first compute the satisfaction of an active user's preference on nonfunctional attribute(s) and then use these satisfaction values to obtain their similarity measures. We then employ the top-k algorithm to identify neighbors of the active user and subsequently, use the weighted average with mean offset method to predict his/her nonfunctional attribute. We evaluate our method using real-world services and also conduct experiments to show that the proposed method improves recommendation accuracy significantly.","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","startPage":"400","endPage":"407","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2015.60","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2015.60","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194373/7195533/07195595.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Collaborative Filtering Method for Personalized Preference-Based Service Recommendation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195595/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","displayDocTitle":"A Collaborative Filtering Method for Personalized Preference-Based Service Recommendation","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15367302","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7195595/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Collaborative Filtering Method for Personalized Preference-Based Service Recommendation","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7272a400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064686S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194373","isNumber":"7195533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194373","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"7195533","articleId":"7195595","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":7195599,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Gao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085359960"},{"name":"Liang Chen","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Liang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37538830200"},{"name":"Jian Wu","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jian","lastName":"Wu","id":"37404829500"},{"name":"Honghao Gao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Honghao","lastName":"Gao","id":"37085365758"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7272-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7271-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7195599","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":340},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mashups","Manifolds","Clustering algorithms","Linear programming","Semantics","Collaboration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","Internet","recommender systems","service-oriented architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NDCG","manifold ranking algorithm","ProgrammableWeb","Web accessible service","SOA","service-oriented architecture","mashup creation","API recommendation","manifold-learning"]}],"abstract":"With the wide adoption of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), the number of web accessible services and their compositions is increasing rapidly. Among huge number of services, how to recommend appropriate ones for automatic composition satisfying users' need is challenging. We investigate services and their compositions in Programmable Web which characterize services as APIs and their compositions as mashups. We study the problem of recommending suitable APIs satisfying users' need for mash up creation. To this end, we propose a manifold ranking framework for API recommendation. First, we categorize existing mashups into functionally similar clusters. Then we recommend APIs for each mash up cluster using manifold ranking algorithm which incorporate the relationships between mashups, between APIs and between mashups and APIs. Intuitively, we take three factors into consideration: (1) We recommend APIs that are in functionally similar mashups. (2) We recommend APIs that are popular in the mashups. (3) We recommend APIs that are similar to each other. Finally, we map a user's requirement for mash up creation to a mash up cluster and recommend APIs generated by the algorithm to user. Experiments based on real dataset crawled from Programmble Web demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of precision, recall, and NDCG.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2015.64","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194373/7195533/07195599.pdf","startPage":"432","endPage":"439","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2015.64","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195533","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Manifold-Learning Based API Recommendation for Mashup Creation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195599","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195599/","displayDocTitle":"Manifold-Learning Based API Recommendation for Mashup Creation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15382554","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7195599/","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Manifold-Learning Based API Recommendation for Mashup Creation","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7272a432.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070439S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194373","isNumber":"7195533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194373","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"7195533","articleId":"7195599","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7195613,"authors":[{"name":"Minhyeop Kim","affiliation":["School of Computing Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Minhyeop","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085350271"},{"name":"In-Young Ko","affiliation":["School of Computing Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"In-Young","lastName":"Ko","id":"37270254000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7272-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7271-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7195613","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":703},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Resource management","Encoding","Genetic algorithms","Data communication","Mobile handsets","Arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","Internet of Things","resource allocation","smart phones","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","Internet of Things","dynamic IoT resource utilization","urban-scale IoT environment","user mobile device","smart phones","composite service execution","service resource allocation approach","data transmission minimization","resource allocation problem","degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem","fitness function","encoding scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["service resource allocation","Internet of things","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195613","abstract":"As various types of Internets of Things (IoT) are deployed in a wide range of areas, the need arises to utilize various IoT resources dynamically to accomplish user tasks. We call this environment an urban-scale IoT environment, where various IoT resources that are necessary to accomplish user tasks are directly connected to each other via users' mobile devices, such as their smart phones. IoT resources are utilized as resources with which to run a composite service that supports user tasks. In this urban-scale IoT environment, it is essential to create efficient binding between a service and an IoT resource so as to execute a composite service for a task successfully. In this paper, we propose a service resource allocation approach which minimizes data transmissions between users' mobile devices and which effectively deal with the constraints of these types of environments. We transformed the resource allocation problem into a variant of the degree-constrained minimum spanning tree problem and applied a genetic algorithm to reduce the time needed to produce a near-optimal solution. We also defined a fitness function and an encoding scheme to apply the genetic algorithm in an efficient manner. The proposed approach shows a 97% success rate on average when used to find near-optimal solutions. In addition, it takes significantly less time than the brute force approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2015.78","startPage":"543","endPage":"550","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2015.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195533","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194373/7195533/07195613.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Resource Allocation Approach Based on a Genetic Algorithm for Composite Services in IoT Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195613/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Resource Allocation Approach Based on a Genetic Algorithm for Composite Services in IoT Environments","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7195613/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15367295","publicationDate":"June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Resource Allocation Approach Based on a Genetic Algorithm for Composite Services in IoT Environments","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7272a543.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057273S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194373","isNumber":"7195533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194373","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"7195533","articleId":"7195613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":7195615,"authors":[{"name":"Elio Goettelmann","affiliation":["CRP Henri Tudor, L-1855 Luxembourg-Kirchberg, Luxembourg","LORIA- INRIA Grand Est, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Elio","lastName":"Goettelmann","id":"37062035800"},{"name":"Amina Ahmed-Nacer","affiliation":["LIMED, Universit\u00e9 Abderhaman Mira, Bejaia, Algeria","LORIA- INRIA Grand Est, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Amina","lastName":"Ahmed-Nacer","id":"37085759677"},{"name":"Samir Youcef","affiliation":["LORIA- INRIA Grand Est, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Youcef","id":"38579960400"},{"name":"Claude Godart","affiliation":["LORIA- INRIA Grand Est, Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, Nancy, France"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"Godart","id":"37282580600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7272-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7271-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7195615","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Security","Context","Quality of service","Companies","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","cloud computing","design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business process model obfuscation","BP model transformation","design-time approach","multicloud context"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Business Process","Security Risk Management","Cloud","Privacy","Obfuscation"]}],"abstract":"Business process (BP) stakeholders want to enjoy the benefits of the cloud, but they are also reluctant to expose their BP models which express the know-how of their companies.

Stakeholders in this domain need to be able to analyze this data in order to make informed planning decisions. To address this complex task, Distributed Analytical Environments (DAEs) have emerged. These environments consist of different distributed analytical and data services, which are composed in a dynamic way to deliver insights that are crucial for stakeholders. Since these environments deal with business critical and sensitive information, strict compliance constraints apply. These constraints lead to situations where certain concrete services are not allowed to exchange data, even though their interaction is necessary to produce the desired results. Finding a valid solution in the space of possible instantiations is a non-trivial problem. In this paper we introduce Nomads, a framework that enables service mobility in such constrained dynamic composition environments to overcome aforementioned restrictions. The framework improves the overall satisfiability and therefore also the quality of constrained DAEs. We outline the requirements of a representative DAE scenario, provide a detailed problem formulation, and then discuss the service mobility framework along with our solution finding algorithm. The evaluation demonstrates that the Nomads framework considerably increases the number of successfully performed compositions even in highly constrained environments.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194373/7195533/07195630.pdf","startPage":"679","endPage":"685","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2015.95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2015.95","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195533","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195630","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nomads - Enabling Distributed Analytical Service Environments for the Smart City Domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Containers","Concrete","Stakeholders","Data models","Cities and towns","Smart cities","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","distributed processing","smart cities","town and country planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nomads","distributed analytical service environment","smart city domain","data analysis","informed planning decision","DAE","distributed data service","business critical information","sensitive information","data exchange","constrained dynamic composition environment","service mobility framework","highly constrained environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["smart city","distributed analytical enviornments","service mobility"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195630/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Nomads - Enabling Distributed Analytical Service Environments for the Smart City Domain","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7195630/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15367288","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nomads - Enabling Distributed Analytical Service Environments for the Smart City Domain","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7272a679.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063294S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194373","isNumber":"7195533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194373","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"7195533","articleId":"7195630","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7195663,"authors":[{"name":"I-Che Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"I-Che","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085426585"},{"name":"John P.

Approximate computing offers a promising way to lower the hardware costs and to speed up the computation by leveraging the error tolerance of applications like image processing. This work proposes a novel approximate matrix-vector multiplier which features low area and high speed. Moreover, its accuracy is dynamically reconfigurable, allowing the user to trade small errors for increased speed. Compared to previous designs, our approach reduces the area cost up to 70% with a 5% average error. With a more relaxed 10% error constraint, it achieves a speedup of 2x. We apply the proposed design to color transformation, a basic operation in face-detection algorithms. The approximate transformed images exhibit only a small decrease in detection accuracy.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Accuracy","Hardware","Adders","Indexes","Registers","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","matrix algebra","multiplying circuits","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low area matrix vector multiplier","high speed matrix vector multiplier","approximate matrix vector multiplier","approximate computing","error tolerance","error constraint","color transformation","face detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Matrix-vector multiplication","approximate computing","dynamic accuracy"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2015.35","startPage":"23","endPage":"28","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193738/7195649/07195663.pdf","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2015.35","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Area and High-Speed Approximate Matrix-Vector Multiplier","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Low-Area and High-Speed Approximate Matrix-Vector Multiplier","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15399346","publicationDate":"April 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7195663/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195663/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Area and High-Speed Approximate Matrix-Vector Multiplier","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"6780a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077726S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193738","isNumber":"7195649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193738","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"7195649","articleId":"7195663","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7195665,"authors":[{"name":"Filip Kod\u00fdtek","affiliation":["Ceske Vysoke Uceni Technicke v Praze, Praha, CZ"],"firstName":"Filip","lastName":"Kod\u00fdtek"},{"name":"R\u00f3bert L\u00f3rencz","affiliation":["Department of Computer Systems, Czech Technical University, Prague"],"firstName":"R\u00f3bert","lastName":"L\u00f3rencz","id":"37973650000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6780-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6779-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6778-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7195665","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":813},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Radiation detectors","Frequency measurement","Entropy","Ring oscillators","Delays","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ring oscillator","PUF","FPGA","physical unclonable functions","efficient device identification","secure device identification","cryptographic key generation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["PUF","FPGA","ring oscillator"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195665","abstract":"This paper deals with design of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) based on FPGA.

It has two advantages with respect to parallel solutions: lower cost and better accuracy. The main disadvantage is represented by the high emulation overhead: for each emulation clock cycle, a number of clock cycles equal to the number of fault locations is required to load the shift register. This paper presents a technique for FPGA probabilistic fault emulation which reduces the emulation overhead, at the expense of accuracy. It is based on pseudo-random permutations within the shift register, while maintaining the number of active fault bits. We obtain a performance improve of one order of magnitude, while we have a cost increase of 27% and lower fault modeling accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2015.49","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193738/7195649/07195688.pdf","startPage":"149","endPage":"152","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2015.49","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195688","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Enhancement of Serial Based FPGA Probabilistic Fault Emulation Techniques","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195688/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Enhancement of Serial Based FPGA Probabilistic Fault Emulation Techniques","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7195688/","publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15399347","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Enhancement of Serial Based FPGA Probabilistic Fault Emulation Techniques","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"6780a149.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071106S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193738","isNumber":"7195649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193738","xplore-issue":"7195649","articleId":"7195688","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7195695,"authors":[{"name":"Arman Allahyari-Abhari","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems, DFKI GmbH, Bremen, Germany","Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Arman","lastName":"Allahyari-Abhari","id":"37085468775"},{"name":"Mathias Soeken","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems, DFKI GmbH, Bremen, Germany","Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Mathias","lastName":"Soeken","id":"37391629800"},{"name":"Rolf Drechsler","affiliation":["Cyber-Physical Systems, DFKI GmbH, Bremen, Germany","Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bremen, Germany"],"firstName":"Rolf","lastName":"Drechsler","id":"37732754500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6780-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6779-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6778-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7195695","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Syntactics","Semantics","Machine learning algorithms","Measurement","Compounds","Quality assessment","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["formal specification","software quality","software reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["requirement phrasing assistance","automatic quality assessment","automatic assistance tools","single consolidated nominal quality predicate","machine learning techniques","prediction reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware/Software Co-Design","specifications","requirements","natural language processing"]}],"abstract":"The design of modern hardware systems is a very complex and time consuming process. At the beginning of the design process, requirements need to be specified. Errors in that early design stage derived by misinterpretation of the requirements can be hard to detect and require significant effort and costs to get fixed. To prevent errors, requirements should be written in a comprehensive and unambiguous way. Thus, designers are interested in automatic assistance tools that help writing better requirements. Conventional approaches are usually rule-based, thus many syntactic and semantic properties are not considered. In this paper we introduce an alternative approach to ensure the quality of requirements. The approach has two stages and assists the designer by providing (i) all relevant statistics about the syntactic and semantic properties of the sentence, and (ii) a single consolidated nominal quality predicate for the sentence such as good, medium, or bad. Although such statistical quality assessment leads to already satisfying results, the algorithm prediction reliability can further be enhanced by machine learning techniques. The achieved reliability for quality assessment in combination with the overview of the metrics about syntax and semantic can help the designer to write more comprehensive and less ambiguous requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Requirement Phrasing Assistance Using Automatic Quality Assessment","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2015.19","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193738/7195649/07195695.pdf","startPage":"183","endPage":"188","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2015.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195649","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195695/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2015","displayDocTitle":"Requirement Phrasing Assistance Using Automatic Quality Assessment","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7195695/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15399319","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Requirement Phrasing Assistance Using Automatic Quality Assessment","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"6780a183.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071172S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193738","isNumber":"7195649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193738","xplore-issue":"7195649","articleId":"7195695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7195697,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Najvirt","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology/Embedded Computing Systems Group, Austria"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Najvirt","id":"37070398600"},{"name":"Thomas Polzer","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology/Embedded Computing Systems Group, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Polzer","id":"38467395700"},{"name":"Florian Beck","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology/Embedded Computing Systems Group, Austria"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Beck","id":"37085393727"},{"name":"Andreas Steininger","affiliation":["Vienna University of Technology/Embedded Computing Systems Group, Austria"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Steininger","id":"37284661800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6780-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6779-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6778-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7195697","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":116},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Containment of Metastable Voltages in FPGAs","abstract":"The significant PVT variations seen with modern technologies make synchronous design inefficient. Asynchronous design with its flexible timing is a promising alternative, but prototyping is difficult on the available FPGA platforms which are clock centric and do not provide the required functional primitives like mutual exclusion or Muller C-elements. The solutions proposed in the literature work nicely in principle, but cannot safely handle metastability issues that are inevitable at interfaces even in asynchronous designs. In this paper we propose a reliable implementation of a Schmitt-trigger, which allows to safely convert potential intermediate voltage levels that result from metastability into late transitions that can be reliably handled in the asynchronous domain. Beyond the actual circuit we also discuss the associated routing constraints to make the circuit work properly in spite of the uncertain routing within FPGAs. Furthermore we propose a procedure for an \"in situ reliability assessment\" of the specific Schmitt-trigger element under consideration, which also applies to metastability containment with high-or low-threshold inverters only. Our proof of concept is based on experimental results for both Xilinx and Altera FPGA platforms.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Logic gates","Synchronization","Delays","Inverters","Threshold voltage","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","circuit reliability","circuit stability","field programmable gate arrays","network routing","trigger circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PVT variations","asynchronous design","flexible timing","prototyping","metastability issues","Schmitt-trigger","intermediate voltage levels","asynchronous domain","routing constraints","uncertain routing","in situ reliability assessment","high-threshold inverters","low-threshold inverters","Xilinx FPGA platforms","Altera FPGA platforms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["asynchronous","FPGA","metastability","Schmitt-trigger","low threshold","high threshold","measurement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195697","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2015.72","startPage":"197","endPage":"202","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193738/7195649/07195697.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195649","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2015.72","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195697/","displayDocTitle":"Containment of Metastable Voltages in FPGAs","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2015","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","accessionNumber":"15399338","htmlLink":"/document/7195697/","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2015","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Containment of Metastable Voltages in FPGAs","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"6780a197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075363S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193738","isNumber":"7195649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193738","xplore-issue":"7195649","articleId":"7195697","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7195698,"authors":[{"name":"Vladimir Petrovic","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Petrovic","id":"38181278200"},{"name":"Milo Krstic","affiliation":["IHP, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany"],"firstName":"Milo","lastName":"Krstic","id":"37087341596"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6780-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6779-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6778-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7195698","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":23,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"abstract":"Protection against radiation effects in digital ASICs chip can be achieved using different design approaches. One of the popular approaches for increasing the reliability is the hardware triplication. However, the hardware triplication does not mean that the susceptibility to radiation effects can be automatically overcome. The automatic random placement of standard cells can result in higher power consumption and more occupied silicon area), with marginal improvement of the linear energy transfer threshold (LET) value. Additionally, the TMR approach usually requires changes in the standard ASIC design flow, even requesting significant modifications of the RTL code. In this paper, we will investigate the issues of design flow for TMR flip-flops, addressing both the issues of compliance to the standard ASIC design methodology, enabling the use of non-modified RTL code, as well as the layout generation of radhard TMR flip-flops, based on standard non-hardened flip-flop components.","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and

We introduce a testing environment, most important technical issues, and results generated on a field programmable gate array. The hybrid automatic repeat request and Reed-Solomon algorithms are explained. We provide a mathematical description, and a block diagram of the adaptation algorithm. All necessary algorithm simplifications are explained in details. The algorithm can be represented by basic operations in hardware. In most cases, it finds the optimal coding for a predefined bit error rate.","doi":"10.1109/DDECS.2015.32","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE 18th International Symposium on Design and Diagnostics of Electronic Circuits & Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/7193738/7195649/07195708.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"266","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DDECS.2015.32","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7195649","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Adaptive Algorithm for Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195708","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-24 April 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7195708/","displayDocTitle":"Design and Implementation of an Adaptive Algorithm for Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15399318","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7195708/","conferenceDate":"22-24 April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Implementation of an Adaptive Algorithm for Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request","confLoc":"Belgrade, Serbia","sourcePdf":"6780a263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063186S","chronDate":"22-24 April 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7193738","isNumber":"7195649","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7193738","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7195649","articleId":"7195708","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":7195715,"authors":[{"name":"Peter Mal\u00edk","affiliation":["Institute of Informatics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava, Slovak Republic"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Mal\u00edk","id":"37295387800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6780-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6779-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"USB ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6778-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"7195715","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":316},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Throughput Floating-Point Dividers Implemented in FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7195715","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Field programmable gate arrays","Throughput","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Table lookup","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dividing circuits","field programmable gate arrays","floating point arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programable gate array","multiplicative inverse","fast computation division algorithm","FPGA","high throughput floating-point divider","word length 32 bit"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["divider","IEEE 754","floating-point","dedicated hardware","FPGA","HPC"]}],"abstract":"New high throughput floating-point dividers implemented in FPGA based on different fast computation division algorithms are proposed.

While a number of researchers have explored such security challenges and open problems in IoT, there is an unfortunate lack of a systematic study of the security challenges in the IoT landscape. In this paper, we aim at bridging this gap by conducting a thorough analysis of IoT security challenges and problems. We present a detailed analysis of IoT attack surfaces, threat models, security issues, requirements, forensics, and challenges. We also provide a set of open problems in IoT security and privacy to guide the attention of researchers into solving the most critical problems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards an Analysis of Security Issues, Challenges, and Open Problems in the Internet of Things","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE World Congress on Services","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2015.12","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE World Congress on Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194861/7196486/07196499.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2015.12","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7196486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7196499","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7196499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","displayDocTitle":"Towards an Analysis of Security Issues, Challenges, and Open Problems in the Internet of Things","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7196499/","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399398","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards an Analysis of Security Issues, Challenges, and Open Problems in the Internet of Things","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7275a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059114S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194861","isNumber":"7196486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194861","citationCount":"179","xplore-issue":"7196486","articleId":"7196499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":7196501,"authors":[{"name":"Sareh Fotuhi Piraghaj","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Sareh Fotuhi","lastName":"Piraghaj","id":"37085408365"},{"name":"Amir Vahid Dastjerdi","affiliation":["Department of Computing and Information Systems, The University of Melbourne, Australia"],"firstName":"Amir Vahid","lastName":"Dastjerdi","id":"37681258100"},{"name":"Rodrigo N.

However, with the recent introduction of Container as a Service (CaaS) by cloud providers, maximizing the utilization at virtual machine (VM) level becomes essential. To this end, this paper focuses on finding efficient virtual machine sizes for hosting containers in such a way that the workload is executed with minimum wastage of resources on VM level. Suitable VM sizes for containers are calculated, and application tasks are grouped and clustered based on their usage patterns obtained from historical data. Furthermore, tasks are mapped to containers and containers are hosted on their associated VM types. We analyzed clouds' trace logs from Google cluster and consider the cloud workload variances, which is crucial for testing and validating our proposed solutions. Experimental results showed up to 7.55% improvement in the average energy consumption compared to baseline scenarios where the virtual machine sizes are fixed. In addition, comparing to the baseline scenarios, the total number of VMs instantiated for hosting the containers is also improved by 68% on average.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Virtual machining","Containers","Energy consumption","Google","Servers","Cloud computing","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","energy consumption","power aware computing","resource allocation","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["virtual machine sizing","container as a service hosting","energy consumption","large-scale cloud data centers","host-level utilization maximization","load balancing techniques","CaaS","VM level","cloud trace log analysis","Google cluster","cloud workload variances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Container as a Service","Virtual Machine","Energy Efficiency"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7196486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2015.14","startPage":"31","endPage":"38","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE World Congress on Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE World Congress on Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194861/7196486/07196501.pdf","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2015.14","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Virtual Machine Sizing for Hosting Containers as a Service (SERVICES 2015)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient Virtual Machine Sizing for Hosting Containers as a Service (SERVICES 2015)","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15399364","publicationDate":"June 2015","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","htmlLink":"/document/7196501/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7196501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Virtual Machine Sizing for Hosting Containers as a Service (SERVICES 2015)","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7275a031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051901S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194861","isNumber":"7196486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194861","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"7196486","articleId":"7196501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":7196533,"authors":[{"name":"Jiuyun Xu","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communitcation Engineering China University of Petroleum(China East), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Jiuyun","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085556819"},{"name":"Dan Jiang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communitcation Engineering China University of Petroleum(China East), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37085560008"},{"name":"Bin Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communitcation Engineering China University of Petroleum(China East), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085562924"},{"name":"Dan Yang","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communitcation Engineering China University of Petroleum(China East), Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37085546301"},{"name":"Stephan Reiff-Marganiec","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science University of Leicester Leicester, UK"],"firstName":"Stephan","lastName":"Reiff-Marganiec","id":"38276151100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-7275-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4673-7274-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-3818"}],"articleNumber":"7196533","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":109},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision trees","Cloud computing","Training","Silicon","Computational modeling","Calculators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","decision trees","trusted computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["local reputation management","cloud computing","cloud customers feedback","cloud service trustworthiness","global reputation score","consumer expectation","consumer needs","trust management framework","decision-tree model","time decay factor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Trust Management","Reputation","Similarity","Decision Tree"]}],"abstract":"In the Cloud computing community, the calculation of the reputation using the feedback of cloud customers is widely adopted to address the issue of trustworthiness of cloud services. Currently, most methods pursue a global reputation score essentially assuming that the value of a cloud service's reputation is the same for every consumer. However, depending on the expectations and needs of a consumer, there can be significant deviation of perceived reputation for the same cloud service. In this paper we propose a trust management framework that differentiates reputation for various user groups thus providing what we term local reputation. To achieve this we compute the similarity of consumers based a decision-tree model which is used to cluster feedback into localised scores. To refine the result, a time decay factor applicable to feedback is also to be considered. The simulation results illustrate that our approach is feasible and also effective for consumers to choose reputable cloud service.","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2015.45","publicationTitle":"2015 IEEE World Congress on Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2015 IEEE World Congress on Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/7194861/7196486/07196533.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2015.45","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7196486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Reputation Management in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7196533","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/7196533/","displayDocTitle":"Local Reputation Management in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2015","accessionNumber":"15399400","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/7196533/","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"17 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Reputation Management in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"New York, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"7275a261.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071568S","chronDate":"June 27 2015-July 2 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7194861","isNumber":"7196486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"7194861","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"7196486","articleId":"7196533","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"}]
