It will be shown that positive charge in the tunnel oxide, mostly generated by the erase operation, is a major cause of the unintentional charge loss/gain mechanisms that disturb the data content of the memory cell. The effects of the erase source bias are evaluated in the context of the positive oxide charge generation and the resulting enhancement of the gate current that causes the data loss. An optimal source bias during erase, around 2 V for our samples, is shown to cause the least positive oxide charge. A model based on the band-to-band tunneling-induced hole generation in Si and subsequent hole injection during the erase operation is presented and discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370023/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4860739","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"Effects of erase source bias on Flash EPROM device reliability","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of erase source bias on Flash EPROM device reliability","sourcePdf":"00370023.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051754S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"35","articleId":"370023","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370025,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Such a feature has been realized for the first time by employing a simple self-feedback regime in each cell circuitry. The potential of the floating gate is set to the tunneling electrode by the source follower action of the built-in cell circuitry, thus assuring a constant electric field strength in the tunnel oxide at each programming cycle independent of the stored charge in the floating gate. The synapse cell is composed of only seven transistors and inherits all the advanced features of the original six-transistor cell, such as the standby-power free and dual polarity characteristics. In addition, by optimizing the intra-cell coupling capacitance ratios, the acceleration effect in updating the weight has also been accomplished. All these features make the new synapse cell fully compatible with the hardware learning architecture of the Neuron-MOS neural network. The new synapse cell concept has been verified by experiments using test circuits fabricated by a double-polysilicon CMOS process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.370025","startPage":"135","endPage":"143","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.370025","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8483","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/8483/00370025.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An excellent weight-updating-linearity EEPROM synapse memory cell for self-learning Neuron-MOS neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370025/","displayDocTitle":"An excellent weight-updating-linearity EEPROM synapse memory cell for self-learning Neuron-MOS neural networks","volume":"42","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4860737","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An excellent weight-updating-linearity EEPROM synapse memory cell for self-learning Neuron-MOS neural networks","sourcePdf":"00370025.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039813S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"28","articleId":"370025","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":370035,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In this paper, the structure of this new device is presented along with its fabrication process, while the performance is analyzed using device simulation. It was found that the speed of the PIN-photodiode in the Si-OEIC is dominated by carrier transit time in the n/sup +/-buried region. Further investigation was made by device simulation on two advanced structures. The speed of response of PIN-photodiode will be improved to as fast as 1 ns by the current Si technology.

Tungsten photo-shield, which has low reflectance and good step coverage characteristics, reduces smear level to -110 dB, combined with a frame-interline-transfer (FIT) scheme. The tungsten photo-shield also acts as a shunt busline, supplying transfer pulses to vertical CCD (V-CCD) electrodes, so that a 1.2/spl times/10/spl circ/5 electron charge handling capability is obtained at a frame transfer frequency of 1 MHz. Newly developed H-CCD shunt wiring suppresses vertical line pair FPN, even with smaller transfer pulse amplitudes. H-CCD shunt wiring also helps reduce power consumption in the H-CCD by 2/3 as compared to that achieved with conventional wiring.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.370036","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/8483/00370036.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.370036","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8483","startPage":"50","endPage":"57","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1-inch 2-M pixel HDTV CCD image sensor with tungsten photo-shield and H-CCD shunt wiring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A 1-inch 2-M pixel HDTV CCD image sensor with tungsten photo-shield and H-CCD shunt wiring","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370036/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4860726","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1-inch 2-M pixel HDTV CCD image sensor with tungsten photo-shield and H-CCD shunt wiring","sourcePdf":"00370036.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051548S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8483","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"1","articleId":"370036","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":370088,"authors":[{"name":"Lang Tong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA"],"lastName":"Lang Tong","id":"37276976900"},{"name":"Guanghan Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Guanghan Xu","id":"37271442400"},{"name":"B.

Performance evaluations are also included and compared with the associated Cramer-Rao bounds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370091/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893685","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"1","displayDocTitle":"Maximum-likelihood estimation of a class of chaotic signals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum-likelihood estimation of a class of chaotic signals","sourcePdf":"00370091.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0288S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"70","articleId":"370091","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":370092,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

Fractionally sampled data are cyclostationary rather than stationary. The problem is cast into a mathematical framework of parameter estimation for a vector stationary process with single input (information sequence) and multiple outputs, by using a time-series representation of a cyclostationary process. A necessary and sufficient condition for channel identifiability from the correlation function of the vector stationary process is derived.

The new codes are very close to block-decodable codes, as decoding of the retrieved sequence can be accomplished by observing (part of) the received codeword plus a very small part (usually only a single bit) of the previous codeword. The basic idea of the new construction is to uniquely represent each source word by a (d,k) sequence with specific predefined properties, and to construct a bridge of /spl beta/, 1/spl les//spl beta//spl les/d, merging bits between every pair of adjacent words. An essential element of the new coding principle is look ahead. The merging bits are governed by the state of the encoder (the history), the present source word to be translated, and by the upcoming source word. The new constructions have the virtue that only one look-up table is required for encoding and decoding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructions of almost block-decodable runlength-limited codes","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.370099","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/8485/00370099.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"287","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.370099","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8485","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370099","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370099/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Constructions of almost block-decodable runlength-limited codes","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893677","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructions of almost block-decodable runlength-limited codes","sourcePdf":"00370099.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028947S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","articleId":"370099","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":370100,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In general, this is a nonconvex optimization problem, and appears to be computationally difficult. An optimization algorithm that seems to perform well is described. Optimized signal sets and associated minimum distances (minimum l/sub /spl infin// separation between two distinct channel outputs) are presented for some example impulse responses. A conjectured upper bound on the minimum distance is given that is easily computed given the impulse response of the channel, the number of inputs, and the input length. This upper bound is shown to be valid for a limited class of impulse response functions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal design","Additive noise","Upper bound","Interference constraints","Noise level","Crosstalk","Senior members","Intersymbol interference","Digital communication","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal synthesis","transient response","optimisation","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete-time signal design","shift-invariant channel","discrete-time linear channel","finite impulse response","finite-length input signals","bounded amplitude","output signals","maximally separated output signals","nonconvex optimization problem","optimization algorithm","optimized signal sets","minimum distances","minimum separation","channel outputs","upper bound","input length","impulse response functions"]}],"doi":"10.1109/18.370110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/8485/00370110.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8485","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.370110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discrete-time signal design for maximizing separation in amplitude","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Discrete-time signal design for maximizing separation in amplitude","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370110/","volume":"41","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4893666","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discrete-time signal design for maximizing separation in amplitude","sourcePdf":"00370110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047047S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2","articleId":"370110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":370112,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this coding procedure the input is sampled at Nyquist's rate or faster, the samples undergo dithered uniform or lattice quantization, using subtractive dither, and the quantizer output is entropy-coded, The rate-distortion performance, and the tradeoff between the sampling rate and the quantization accuracy is investigated, utilizing the observation that the coding scheme is equivalent to an additive noise channel. It is shown that the mean-square error of the scheme is fixed as long as the product of the sampling period and the quantizer second moment is kept constant, while for a fixed distortion the coding rate generally increases when the sampling rate exceeds the Nyquist rate. Finally, as the lattice quantizer dimension becomes large, the equivalent additive noise channel of the scheme tends to be white Gaussian, and both the rate and the distortion performance become invariant to the sampling rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate-distortion performance in coding bandlimited sources by sampling and dithered quantization","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.370112","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/8485/00370112.pdf","startPage":"141","endPage":"154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.370112","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8485","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370112/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Rate-distortion performance in coding bandlimited sources by sampling and dithered quantization","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893664","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate-distortion performance in coding bandlimited sources by sampling and dithered quantization","sourcePdf":"00370112.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03738S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"35","articleId":"370112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370113,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

In general, there will be several different decoding strategies, each corresponding to the optimal rule over some range p/spl isin/[p/sub i-1/, p/sub i/]. Each of these strategies can be implemented by standard array with the appropriate choice of coset leaders that are not in general of minimum weight. We give optimal rules for selecting coset leaders in the first region [0, p/sub 1/] and the region [p/sub max/, 1/2] for any linear mapping between information bits and codewords. The determination of the optimal rule has been an open problem for small p. The rule for p>p/sub max/ is important because for many codes, when p is fixed the optimal rule for any coset corresponds to either the optimal rule for small p, or the optimal rule for p near 1/2. The optimal decoding strategy varies with the generator matrix used in general, but it is demonstrated that the optimal generator matrix is separable when d/sup /spl perp//>2. The results are shown to extend in a natural way to the case where the goal is to minimize the probability that arbitrary collections of information bits are in error. We examine some specific codes, and compare the performance under optimal decoding to the performance of previously suggested strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.370113","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/8485/00370113.pdf","startPage":"130","endPage":"140","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.370113","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8485","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal information bit decoding of linear block codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimal information bit decoding of linear block codes","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4893663","volume":"41","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal information bit decoding of linear block codes","sourcePdf":"00370113.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051325S","chronDate":"Jan 1995","isNumber":"8485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"7","articleId":"370113","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":370115,"authors":[{"name":"Guu-Chang Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Guu-Chang Yang","id":"37276271000"},{"name":"T.E.

Up to now, all work on OOCs have assumed that the constraint placed on the autocorrelation and that placed on the cross-correlation are the same. We consider-codes for which the two constraints are not equal. Specifically we develop bounds on the size of such OOCs and demonstrate constriction techniques for building them. The results demonstrate that a significant increase in the code size is possible by letting the autocorrelation constraint exceed the cross-correlation constraint. These results suggest that for a given performance requirement the optimal OOC may be one with unequal constraints. This paper also views OOCs with unequal auto- and cross-correlation constraints as constant-weight unequal error protection (UEP) codes with two levels of protection. The bounds derived are interpreted from this viewpoint.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical orthogonal codes with unequal auto- and cross-correlation constraints","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.370115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel3/18/8485/00370115.pdf","startPage":"96","endPage":"106","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.370115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8485","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370115/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1995","displayDocTitle":"Optical orthogonal codes with unequal auto- and cross-correlation constraints","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Jan. 1995","accessionNumber":"4893661","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical orthogonal codes with unequal auto- and cross-correlation constraints","sourcePdf":"00370115.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046481S","chronDate":"Jan.  1995","isNumber":"8485","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"110","articleId":"370115","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370117,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The largest rate achievable by codes with such a decoder is called the d-capacity C/sub d/(W). The choice d(x, y)=0 if and only if (iff) W(y|x)>0 makes C/sub d/(W) equal to the \"zero undetected error\" or \"erasures-only\" capacity C/sub eo/(W). The graph-theoretic concepts of Shannon capacity (1956, 1974) and Sperner capacity are also special cases of d-capacity, viz. for a noiseless channel with a suitable {0, 1}-valued function d. We show that the lower bound on d-capacity given previously by Csiszar and Korner (1980), and Hui (1983), is not tight in general, but C/sub d/(W)>0 iff this bound is positive. The \"product space\" improvement of the lower bound is considered,and a \"product space characterization\" of C/sub eo/(W) is obtained. We also determine the erasures-only (e.o.) capacity of a deterministic arbitrarily varying channel defined by a bipartite graph, and show that it equals capacity.

When both data streams are received, the decoder uses the combined data at rate R/sub 1/+R/sub 2/ to reconstruct the source information with average distortion d/sub 0/. If a communication breakdown prevents one of the data streams from reaching the receiver, the decoder has to base its reconstruction solely on the available data at rate either R/sub 1/ or R/sub 2/. This results in a higher distortion of either d/sub 1/ or d/sub 2/, respectively. The region /spl Rscr/ of all achievable quintuples (R/sub 1/, R/sub 2/, d/sub 0/, d/sub 1/, d/sub 2/) has been determined in the so-called \"no excess rate\" sum case defined by imposing the requirement R/sub 1/+R/sub 2/=R(d/sub 0/), where R(/spl middot/) is the rate-distortion function of the source. The case with excess rate sum, characterized by R/sub 1/+R/sub 2/>R(d/sub 0/), is challenging. We study in this paper a special case of it in which the requirements R/sub t/=R(d/sub t/), t=1, 2, are imposed; we refer to this as the \"no excess marginal rate\" case. The lower and upper bounds on d/sub 0/ we obtain are separated by only a tiny gap when evaluated for a binary equiprobable source and the Hamming distortion measure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.370136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.370136","endPage":"357","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/8486/00370136.pdf","startPage":"349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple description source coding with no excess marginal rate","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370136/","displayDocTitle":"Multiple description source coding with no excess marginal rate","volume":"41","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4907192","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple description source coding with no excess marginal rate","sourcePdf":"370136.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037252S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"29","articleId":"370136","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":370138,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The binary images of these codes under the Gray map are nonlinear, but formally self-dual. The construction involves Hensel lifting of binary cyclic codes. Quaternary quadratic residue codes are obtained by Hensel lifting of the classical binary quadratic residue codes. Repeated Hensel lifting produces a universal code defined over the 2-adic integers. We investigate the connections between this universal code and the codes defined over Z/sub 4/, the composition of the automorphism group, and the structure of idempotents over Z/sub 4/. We also derive a square root bound on the minimum Lee weight, and explore the connections with the finite Fourier transform. Certain self-dual codes over Z/sub 4/ are shown to determine even unimodular lattices, including the extended quadratic residue code of length q+1, where q/spl equiv/-1(mod8) is a prime power. When q=23, the quaternary Golay code determines the Leech lattice in this way. This is perhaps the simplest construction for this remarkable lattice that is known.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quaternary quadratic residue codes and unimodular lattices","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.370138","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/8486/00370138.pdf","startPage":"366","endPage":"377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.370138","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8486","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370138","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370138/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Quaternary quadratic residue codes and unimodular lattices","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907194","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quaternary quadratic residue codes and unimodular lattices","sourcePdf":"370138.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079441S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"100","articleId":"370138","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370139,"authors":[{"name":"W.C.

Their periods, shift equivalence, linear spans, and autocorrelation functions are derived. The interleaved sequences include a large number of popular sequences, such as multiplexed sequences, clock-controlled sequences, Kasami (1966) sequences, GMW sequences, geometric sequences, and No (1989) sequences. A special class of the interleaved sequences is constructed by mapping GF(q/sup m/) sequences into GF(q) sequences in terms of different bases of GF(q/sup m/) over GF(q). As an application of the theory of interleaved sequences, some new families of binary pseudo-random sequences are constructed, which have large linear spans, optimal periodic cross/autocorrelation functions, balance, and the rapidly \"hopped\" properties. A complete comparison of the new family of sequences with the Gold sequence family, the Kasami (small and large set) sequence families, the Bent-function sequence family, and the No sequence family is discussed. This shows that the new sequence families have important advantages for use in spread-spectrum multiple-access communication systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370141/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907197","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Theory and applications of q-ary interleaved sequences","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory and applications of q-ary interleaved sequences","sourcePdf":"370141.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036331S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"149","articleId":"370141","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370142,"authors":[{"name":"R.W.

We then apply this concept to the study of the erasure and Z-channels, for which we propose linear coding schemes that admit simple decoding. We show that /spl theta/ is particularly relevant to the erasure channel since linear codes achieve a vanishing error probability as long as p/spl lesspl theta/, where p is the probability of erasure. In effect, /spl theta/ can be thought of as a capacity notion designed for codes rather than for channels. Binomial codes haven the highest possible /spl theta/ (and achieve capacity). As for the Z-channel, a subcapacity is derived with respect to the linear coding scheme. For a transition probability in the range ]log (3/2); 1[, we show how to achieve this subcapacity. As a by-product we obtain improved constructions and existential results for intersecting codes (linear Sperner families) which are used in our coding schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/18.370148","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.370148","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/8486/00370148.pdf","startPage":"469","endPage":"477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8486","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The threshold probability of a code","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370148/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"The threshold probability of a code","volume":"41","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907204","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The threshold probability of a code","sourcePdf":"370148.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035711S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"15","articleId":"370148","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":370154,"authors":[{"name":"R.H.

Binary linear UEP (LUEP) codes combined with a Gray mapped QPSK signal set are used to obtain new efficient QPSK block-modulation codes for unequal error protection. Several examples of QPSK modulation codes that have the same minimum squared Euclidean distance as the best QPSK modulation codes, of the same rate and length, are given. In the new constructions of QPSK block-modulation codes, even-length binary LUEP codes are used. Good even-length binary LUEP codes are obtained when shorter binary linear codes are combined using either the well-known |u~|u~+v~|-construction or the so-called construction X. Both constructions have the advantage of resulting in optimal or near-optimal binary LUEP codes of short to moderate lengths, using very simple linear codes, and may be used as constituent codes in the new constructions. LUEP codes lend themselves quite naturally to multistage decoding up to their minimum distance, using the decoding of component subcodes. A new suboptimal two-stage soft-decision decoding of LUEP codes is presented and its application to QPSK block-modulation codes for UEP illustrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature phase shift keying","Error correction codes","Decoding","Modulation coding","Noise level","Information theory","Euclidean distance","Power system protection","Pulse modulation","Binary sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quadrature phase shift keying","error correction codes","binary sequences","block codes","linear codes","modulation coding","decoding","telecommunication channels","digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["unequal error protection codes","broadcast channels","QPSK block-modulation codes","digital communication systems","binary linear UEP codes","Gray mapped QPSK signal set","QPSK modulation codes","minimum squared Euclidean distance","code rate","code length","even-length binary LUEP codes","binary linear codes","multistage decoding","minimum distance","subcodes","suboptimal two-stage soft-decision decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370154","doi":"10.1109/18.370154","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel4/18/8486/00370154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.370154","startPage":"576","endPage":"581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8486","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QPSK block-modulation codes for unequal error protection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"QPSK block-modulation codes for unequal error protection","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907224","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QPSK block-modulation codes for unequal error protection","sourcePdf":"370154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.023907S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8486","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"9","articleId":"370154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-29"},{"_id":370159,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Computation of overall similarity measure (OSM) is studied between a system observation and the left hand side of a rule for a class of T-similarity measure (SM) models. It is shown that for an n-antecedent system, if the connective AND in both the left hand side of a rule and a system observation is taken to be a t-norm operator which is the same t-norm operator used in the T-similarity measure model, then the OSM can be obtained by: 1) computing the SM between the linguistic term of an antecedent variable in the rule and the observation of the corresponding antecedent variable separately for each of the antecedent variables in the rule, and 2) combining all of these SMs using the t-norm operator. Thus, one avoids the computation of the OSM via the n-dimensional matrix operations. Based on an analysis of the relationship between the OSM and SMs for an n-antecedent system, a search scheme, called two-level tree search, is proposed as opposed to an exhaustive search to save search cost associated with the computation of the OSM. Computational complexity is analyzed for both the exhaustive and the two-level tree search schemes.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.370188","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8487","startPage":"555","endPage":"568","pdfPath":"/iel3/21/8487/00370188.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.370188","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-level tree search in fuzzy expert systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hybrid intelligent systems","Fuzzy reasoning","Fuzzy sets","Samarium","Costs","Computational complexity","System testing","Fuzzy systems","Aggregates","Industrial engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expert systems","fuzzy logic","fuzzy systems","computational complexity","tree searching","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-level tree search","fuzzy expert systems","overall similarity measure","system observation","T-similarity measure","linguistic term","antecedent variable","n-dimensional matrix operations","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Two-level tree search in fuzzy expert systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370188/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4913686","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-level tree search in fuzzy expert systems","sourcePdf":"00370188.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065594S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"8","articleId":"370188","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":370192,"authors":[{"name":"D.L.

Temporal pattern generation is based on recognition of the contexts of individual components. Based on its acquired experience, the model actively yields system anticipation, which then compares with the actual input flow. A mismatch triggers self-organization of context learning, which ultimately leads to resolving various ambiguities in producing complex temporal patterns. The architecture of the model incorporates a short term memory for building associations between remote components and recurrent connections for self-organization and component generation in a temporal pattern. Synaptic modification is based on a one-shot normalized Hebbian rule, which is shown to exhibit temporal masking. The major conclusion, namely the network model which can learn to generate any complex temporal pattern, is established analytically. An estimate on the efficiency of the training algorithm is provided. Multiple temporal patterns can be incrementally acquired by the system, exhibiting a form of retroactive interference. Neural and cognitive plausibility of the model is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.370192","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","startPage":"615","endPage":"628","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel3/21/8487/00370192.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.370192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anticipation-based temporal pattern generation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Pattern recognition","Computer simulation","Buildings","Pattern analysis","Interference","Character generation","Intelligent systems","Animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","Hebbian learning","temporal reasoning","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network model","complex temporal pattern generation","system anticipation","input flow","self-organization","context learning","recurrent connections","Hebbian rule","temporal masking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Anticipation-based temporal pattern generation","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4913690","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370192/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anticipation-based temporal pattern generation","sourcePdf":"00370192.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04857S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"33","articleId":"370192","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":370193,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

The modified elitist strategy generates the current population of M individuals by reserving the individual with the highest fitness value from the previous generation and generating M-1 individuals through a generation change. The author's analysis is based on a Markov chain: by assuming a simple GA in which the genetic operation in the generation changes is restricted to selection, crossover, and mutation, and by evaluating the eigenvalues of the transition matrix of the Markov chain, the convergence rate of the GAs is computed in terms of a mutation probability /spl mu/. In this way, the authors show the probability that the population includes the individual with the highest fitness value is lower-bounded by 1-O(|/spl lambda/*|/sup n/), |/spl lambda/*|<1, where n is the number of the generation changes and /spl lambda/* is a specified eigenvalue of the transition matrix.

This state assignment problem (SAP) belongs to a broader class of combinatorial optimization problems than the well studied traveling salesman problem, which can be formulated as a special case of SAP. The search for a good solution is considerably involved for the SAP due to a large number of equivalent solutions, and no effective heuristic has been found so far to cater to all types of circuits. In this paper, a matrix representation is used as the genotype for a genetic algorithm (GA) approach to this problem. A novel selection mechanism is introduced, and suitable genetic operators for crossover and mutation, are constructed. The properties of each of these elements of the GA are discussed and an analysis of parameters that influence the algorithm is given. A canonical form for a solution is defined to significantly reduce the search space and number of local minima. Experiments with several examples show that the GA approach yields results that are often comparable to, or better than those obtained using established heuristics that embody extensive domain knowledge.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370202/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4913700","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Designing genetic algorithms for the state assignment problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing genetic algorithms for the state assignment problem","sourcePdf":"00370202.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03132S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8487","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"30","articleId":"370202","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":370270,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

These IGBTs can therefore be protected by the same relatively slow-acting circuitry. The more efficient IGBTs, however, have lower short-circuit withstand times. While protection of these types of IGBTs is not difficult, it does require a reassessment of the traditional protection methods used for bipolar transistors. An in-depth discussion on the behavior of IGBTs under different short-circuit conditions is carried out and the effects of various parameters on permissible short-circuit time are analyzed. The paper also rethinks the problem of providing short-circuit protection in relation to the special characteristics of the most efficient IGBTs. The pros and cons of some of the existing protection circuits are discussed and, based on the recommendations, a protection scheme is implemented to demonstrate that reliable short-circuit protection of these types of IGBTs can be achieved without difficulty in a PWM power convertor motor drive application.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370271/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1995","volume":"31","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March-April 1995","accessionNumber":"4919994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"A discussion on IGBT short-circuit behavior and fault protection schemes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A discussion on IGBT short-circuit behavior and fault protection schemes","sourcePdf":"00370271.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029459S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1995","isNumber":"8490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"160","articleId":"370271","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370275,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In many cases, the original design is marginal or inadequate; the maintenance and testing is practically nonexistent; but the system is called upon during emergency conditions and is expected to perform flawlessly. This paper begins with basic battery theory starting with the electrochemical cell. A working knowledge of the battery cell is important to understand typical problems such as hydrogen production, sulfating, and battery charging. The paper then discusses some of the common batteries and battery chargers. While this paper concentrates primarily on the lead acid type of battery, the theory can be utilized on other types such as the nickel-cadmium. Reference is made to industry standards and codes which are used for the design, installation, and maintenance of battery systems. Along with these standards is a discussion of the design considerations, maintenance and testing, and, finally, some advanced battery system topics such as individual battery cell voltage equalizers and battery pulsing units. The goal of this paper is to provide the reader with a basic working understanding of a battery system. Only with that knowledge can a person be expected to design and/or properly maintain a battery system which may be called upon during an emergency to minimize the effects of a normal power outage, to minimize personnel hazards and to reduce property damage.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8490","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industry Applications","pdfPath":"/iel3/28/8490/00370294.pdf","doi":"10.1109/28.370294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/28.370294","startPage":"419","endPage":"428","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Basics and advances in battery systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370294/","displayDocTitle":"Basics and advances in battery systems","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4920017","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March-April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Basics and advances in battery systems","sourcePdf":"00370294.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074939S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1995","isNumber":"8490","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"27","articleId":"370294","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370298,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

The architecture is designed with 1 /spl mu/m CMOS technology using the scalable design rules of MDS Integrated Services Inc. (MOSIS). The VLSI architecture contains approximately 200,000 transistors and it is capable of operating at a speed of 34 MHz. The HDTV signals are decomposed into seven bands.

A major compression is performed by converting the fixed-length codes to variable-length codes through an entropy coding scheme. Huffman coding combined with run-length coding is shown to be a very efficient coding scheme. To speed up the process of search for a symbol in a Huffman tree and to reduce the memory size we have proposed a tree clustering and a pattern matching algorithm to avoid high sparsity of the tree. The method is shown to be very efficient in memory size and fast searching for the symbol. For an experimental video data with Huffman codes extended up to 16 bits in length, i.e. it is used for the standard JPEG, the result of experiments show that the proposed algorithm has a very high speed and performance.

The algorithm is based on the work presented by Perez, Wismer and Becker (1983) in which a software implementation was proposed. The byte-wise CRC algorithm is translated to hardware and pressed in APHL (VLSI design automation language). The method used calculates CRC 'on the fly' and is much faster then the look-up table method proposed by Lee (1981). The chip is 8 times faster than the serial implementation of Sait and Khan (see ibid., vol. 39, no.4, p.911-910, 1993) with smaller hardware requirements (occupies lesser area). The number of clock cycles required to generate and transmit any CRC (for an 8 byte message) is just two more than the time required to calculate it (in all 10 clock pulses).

In the conventional approach, the equivalent mass matrix is defined as a function of Jacobian matrix and inertia of manipulator. Therefore, it is difficult to know the variation of the equivalent mass matrix precisely and to select it arbitrarily. This makes it difficult to realize the decoupling motion controller in the operational space. To improve the above problem, the authors introduce a robust control strategy based on a disturbance observer. In the observer-based approach, the equivalent mass matrix is determined arbitrarily independently of configuration and inertia variation of the manipulator. First, the equivalent mass matrix based on robust control is derived. Second, a simplification method of an operational space controller is discussed by using the equivalent mass matrix. Several experimental results are shown to confirm the validity of the proposed methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A motion control strategy based on equivalent mass matrix in multidegree-of-freedom manipulator","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/41.370377","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/41/8493/00370377.pdf","startPage":"123","endPage":"130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.370377","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8493","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370377/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"A motion control strategy based on equivalent mass matrix in multidegree-of-freedom manipulator","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"42","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4919162","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A motion control strategy based on equivalent mass matrix in multidegree-of-freedom manipulator","sourcePdf":"00370377.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026555S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8493","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"77","articleId":"370377","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":370378,"authors":[{"name":"P.V.

These motors are exposed to a wide variety of environments and conditions which age the motor and make it subject to incipient faults. These incipient faults, if left undetected, contribute to the degradation and eventual failure of the motors. Artificial neural networks have been proposed and have demonstrated the capability of solving the motor monitoring and fault detection problem using an inexpensive, reliable, and noninvasive procedure. However, the major drawback of conventional artificial neural network fault detection is the inherent black box approach that can provide the correct solution, but does not provide heuristic interpretation of the solution. Engineers prefer accurate fault detection as well as the heuristic knowledge behind the fault detection process. Fuzzy logic is a technology that can easily provide heuristic reasoning while being difficult to provide exact solutions. The authors introduce the methodology behind a novel hybrid neural/fuzzy system which merges the neural network and fuzzy logic technologies to solve fault detection problems. They also discuss a training procedure for this neural/fuzzy fault detection system. This procedure is used to determine the correct solutions while providing qualitative, heuristic knowledge about the solutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/41.370378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8493","startPage":"131","endPage":"138","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/41/8493/00370378.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using a neural/fuzzy system to extract heuristic knowledge of incipient faults in induction motors.

The proposed controller is composed of two fuzzy controllers to obtain good tracking and regulating responses. Unlike the conventional fuzzy controller, the error between the outputs of a reference model and the controlled drive is used to drive the proposed fuzzy controller. The drive rotor speed response can closely follow the trajectory produced by the reference model, and good load speed regulating response can also be obtained simultaneously owing to the possession of two-degrees-of-freedom in structure.

The authors describe an automatic technique that not only improves the worst situations, such as those encountered with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surface coils, but also corrects typical inhomogeneities encountered in routine volume data sets, such as MRI head scans, without generating additional artifact. Because the technique uses only the patient data set, the technique can be applied retrospectively to all data sets, and corrects both patient independent effects, such as rf coil design, and patient dependent effects, such as attenuation of overlying tissue experienced both in high field MRI and X-ray computed tomography (CT). The authors show results for several MRI imaging situations including thorax, head, and breast. Following such corrections, region of interest analyses, volume histograms, and thresholding techniques are more meaningful. The value of such correction algorithms may increase dramatically with increased use of high field strength magnets and associated patient-dependent rf attenuation in overlying tissues.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4913204","pubMedId":"18215808","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Retrospective correction of intensity inhomogeneities in MRI","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Retrospective correction of intensity inhomogeneities in MRI","sourcePdf":"00370400.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043131S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"139","articleId":"370400","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":370403,"authors":[{"name":"C.A.

This proposed approach offers an accurate, fast, and robust delineation of the LV long-axis. The location and shape of the generated long-axis can then be utilized to define automatically the tomographic slices for enhanced visualization and quantification of the clinical data. The methodology is broadly composed of two main steps: (1) volume segmentation of cardiac SPECT data; and (2) topological goniometry, a novel approach incorporating volume visualization and computer graphics ideas to determine the overall shape of 3-D objects. The outcome of the algorithm is a 3-D curve representing the overall pose of the LV long-axis. Experimental results on both phantom and clinical data (50 technetium-99m and 74 thallium-201) are presented. An interactive graphical interface to visualize the volume (3-D) data, the left ventricle, and its pose is an integral part of the overall methodology. This technique is completely data driven and expeditious, making it viable for routine clinical use.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.370405","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","startPage":"88","endPage":"99","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel3/42/8494/00370405.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.370405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic determination of LV orientation from SPECT data","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Biomedical imaging","Medical diagnostic imaging","Geometry","Heart","Shape","Tomography","Cardiology","Nuclear medicine","Myocardium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical image processing","single photon emission computed tomography","cardiology","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["left ventricle orientation determination","cardiac SPECT data","clinical data visualization","clinical data quantification","topological goniometry","volume visualization","computer graphics ideas","3D object overall shape","clinical data","phantom data","interactive graphical interface","technetium-99m","thallium-201","medical diagnostic imaging","diagnostic nuclear medicine","tomographic slices","volume segmentation","Tc","Tl"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","displayDocTitle":"Automatic determination of LV orientation from SPECT data","volume":"14","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4913209","pubMedId":"18215813","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370405/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic determination of LV orientation from SPECT data","sourcePdf":"00370405.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061798S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8494","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"12","articleId":"370405","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":370409,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

ISAID is comprised of two modules: the circuit generator and the circuit corrector. The circuit generator is based on newly developed methods that are used to handle hierarchical generation of topologies and size MOS transistors so that the performance of designed circuits compare satisfactorily with their specifications. To avoid long design times, simulation is used only after the generation of an initial circuit topology. Simulated performances may therefore be found to differ from the required. One novel feature of the proposed methodology is that in such cases a circuit corrector is invoked to correct the initial design. The circuit corrector is essentially a novel application of qualitative reasoning, which, without iterative simulation analyses performance trade-offs, thereby selects circuit adjustments-transistor size adjustments or topological modifications-that would improve the problematic performances. Several design examples have demonstrated the benefits of the ISAID design approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8495","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/8495/00370422.pdf","doi":"10.1109/43.370422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.370422","startPage":"218","endPage":"238","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analog IC design automation.

Moment-matching techniques using Pade approximations have recently been applied to simulating modelled interconnect networks that include lossy coupled transmission lines and nonlinear terminations, giving a marked increase in efficiency over traditional simulation techniques. Nevertheless, moment-matching can be inaccurate in high-speed circuits due to critical properties of Pade approximations. Further, moment-generation for transmission line networks can be shown to have increasing numerical truncation error with higher order moments. These inaccuracies are reflected in both the frequency and transient response and there is no criterion for determining the limits of the error. In this paper, a multipoint moment-matching, or complex frequency hopping (CFH) technique is introduced which extracts accurate dominant poles of a linear subnetwork up to any predefined maximum frequency. The method generates a single transfer function for a large linear subnetwork and provides for a CPU/accuracy tradeoff. A new algorithm is also introduced for generating higher-order moments for transmission lines without incurring increasing truncation error. Several interconnect examples are considered which demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency in both the time and frequency domains of the new method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of interconnect networks using complex frequency hopping (CFH)","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.370425","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel3/43/8495/00370425.pdf","startPage":"186","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.370425","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8495","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370425","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370425/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of interconnect networks using complex frequency hopping (CFH)","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4881806","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of interconnect networks using complex frequency hopping (CFH)","sourcePdf":"00370425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041449S","chronDate":"Feb 1995","isNumber":"8495","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"249","articleId":"370425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370427,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixin Yan","affiliation":["School of Engineering Science, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada"],"lastName":"Zhixin Yan","id":"37346723600"},{"name":"M.J.

In essence, this class is built from state machines sharing a set of places modeling the availability of system resources. The analysis of S/sup 3/PR leads us to characterize deadlock situations in terms of a zero marking for some structural objects called siphons. In order to prevent the system from deadlocks, we propose a policy for resource allocation based on the addition of new places to the net imposing restrictions that prevent the presence of unmarked siphons (direct cause of deadlocks). Finally we present the application of this technique to a realistic FMS case.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/70.370500","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","startPage":"173","endPage":"184","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/8499/00370500.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.370500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Petri net based deadlock prevention policy for flexible manufacturing systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System recovery","Flexible manufacturing systems","Control systems","Petri nets","Workstations","Availability","Resource management","Manufacturing processes","Quality control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible manufacturing systems","Petri nets","resource allocation","production control","finite state machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Petri net","deadlock prevention policy","flexible manufacturing systems","modeling","FMS","state machines","system resource availability","zero marking","siphons","resource allocation","production control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"A Petri net based deadlock prevention policy for flexible manufacturing systems","volume":"11","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4937383","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370500/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Petri net based deadlock prevention policy for flexible manufacturing systems","sourcePdf":"00370500.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034876S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8499","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"902","articleId":"370500","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":370511,"authors":[{"name":"Tan Fung Chan","affiliation":["Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"lastName":"Tan Fung Chan","id":"37614178600"},{"name":"R.V.

A comparison is made with the gradient projection method for avoiding joint limits. While the gradient projection method provides the optimal direction for the joint velocity vector within the null space, its magnitude is not unique and is adjusted by a scalar coefficient chosen by trial and error. It is shown in this paper that one fixed value of the scalar coefficient is not suitable even in a small workspace. The proposed manipulation scheme automatically chooses an appropriate magnitude of the self-motion throughout the workspace. This scheme, unlike the gradient projection method, guarantees joint limit avoidance, and also minimizes unnecessary self-motion.

Fundamentally, all techniques discussed in this article proceed from using the same sequence of data samples and vary only, but importantly, in how those samples are used in achieving the parameter estimation. All of these techniques, in other words, seek the same quantitative parameters to represent the sampled data, but use different routes to get there. The techniques for estimating the parameters are either linear or nonlinear. The linear techniques are emphasized in this presentation. In particular, the matrix pencil method is described, which is more robust to noise in the sampled data. The matrix pencil approach has a lower variance of the estimates of the parameters of interest than a polynomial-type method (Prony's method belongs to this category), and is also computationally more efficient. A bandpass version of the matrix pencil can be implemented in hardware, utilizing an AT&T DSP32C chip operating in real time.

This is a primary factor in the renewed interest in Luneberg lenses. Luneberg (1944) lenses prove useful in a variety of antenna and scattering applications. In antenna applications, their chief advantages are an ability to form multiple beams that may point in arbitrary directions, and their broadband behavior. Lens weight, and complexities involved in manufacturing such lenses, remain their primary drawbacks. Unfortunately, no significant advances in the fabrication techniques have come to pass in forty years. However, operation at millimeter-wave frequencies makes the lens weight inconsequential. The vast majority of the research on spherical lenses took place before computers were commonplace in antenna design. The author reviews some of the applications of Luneberg lenses, and adds some more recent data, generated using a numerical model.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370587/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"37","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4944361","displayDocTitle":"A Luneberg-lens update","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Luneberg-lens update","sourcePdf":"00370587.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031221S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8501","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"74","citationCount":"60","articleId":"370587","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":370614,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongnong Jiang","affiliation":["The Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhongnong Jiang","id":"37350678200"},{"name":"A.N.

The algorithm is a variant of the simplex algorithm of linear programming, which has an interpretation as an implicit multiple exchange. It is iterative, robust, and exhibits good convergence speed. Global optimum convergence is guaranteed. Both complex and real-valued impulse responses can be designed with it; the design of complex coefficient filters is new. An example is given for each case. The design of noncausal filters is new. In addition to these new applications, we conjecture that this new algorithm may have important advantages over existing techniques, with respect to the maximum filter length possible, speed and stability of convergence, accuracy, and memory requirements. The ability to design long filters is among the more significant improvements over previous work. Filters of length 1000 have been designed with the new method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.370616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8502/00370616.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.370616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502","startPage":"605","endPage":"616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal design of FIR filters with the complex Chebyshev error criteria","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370616","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal design of FIR filters with the complex Chebyshev error criteria","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370616/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4937722","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal design of FIR filters with the complex Chebyshev error criteria","sourcePdf":"00370616.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053168S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"59","articleId":"370616","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370617,"authors":[{"name":"P.S.R.

The framework covers two useful subclasses: i) causal stable IIR filter banks. ii) linear phase FIR filter banks. There exists a very efficient structurally perfect reconstruction implementation for such a class. Filter banks of high frequency selectivity can be achieved by using the proposed framework with low complexity. The properties of such a class are discussed in detail. The design of the analysis/synthesis systems reduces to the design of a single transfer function. Very simple design methods are given both for FIR and IIR cases. Zeros of arbitrary multiplicity at aliasing frequency can be easily imposed, for the purpose of generating wavelets with regularity property. In the IIR case, two new classes of IIR maximally flat filters different from Butterworth filters are introduced. The filter coefficients are given in closed form. The wavelet bases corresponding to the biorthogonal systems are generated. the authors also provide a novel mapping of the proposed 1-D framework into 2-D. The mapping preserves the following: i) perfect reconstruction; ii) stability in the IIR case; iii) linear phase in the FIR case; iv) zeros at aliasing frequency; v) frequency characteristic of the filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/78.370620","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8502/00370620.pdf","startPage":"649","endPage":"665","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.370620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8502","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new class of two-channel biorthogonal filter banks and wavelet bases","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370620/","displayDocTitle":"A new class of two-channel biorthogonal filter banks and wavelet bases","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4937726","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new class of two-channel biorthogonal filter banks and wavelet bases","sourcePdf":"00370620.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074862S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"299","articleId":"370620","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":370623,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.

A bandpass extension to the Nyquist criterion is derived, showing that restrictions on bandpass frequency position for odd orders of nonuniform sampling tend to zero as N tends to infinity. Bandpass interpolants based on the sinc function are derived for the generalized Nth-order sampled bandpass signals. It is shown that, for minimum (Nyquist) rate sampling, these interpolants are comprised of N bandpass filters, each with independent phase. The number of bandpass filters comprising the interpolant is found to decrease as the sample rate increases. The advantage of describing Nth-order sampling as the Nth replication and uniform sampling of a signal is demonstrated. Finally, digital implementation of the Nth-order bandpass sampling interpolants is discussed. It is established that it is not practicable to attempt to perform nonuniform bandpass sampling at the theoretical minimum rate, where the interpolation is to be performed digitally.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370623/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4937729","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A generalization of nonuniform bandpass sampling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A generalization of nonuniform bandpass sampling","sourcePdf":"00370623.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033319S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"43","articleId":"370623","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":370627,"authors":[{"name":"J.K.

The effect of employing the real processing methodology on the angle estimation performance of beamspace MUSIC is explored. Specifically, the distribution of the real-valued signal subspace eigenvectors is derived and used in an asymptotic analysis of the bias and variance of the MUSIC estimator. The theoretical analysis shows that processing the real part of the beamspace sample covariance matrix offers significant performance gains, in addition to the obvious computational benefit, relative to the conventional complex-valued procedure, particularly in the case of correlated sources. Monte Carlo simulations are included to verify the theoretical expressions. A trade-off study of the estimation accuracy versus the desire to provide adequate rejection of unwanted signals in a sector-based interrogation scheme for various beamforming architectures is also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370628/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"43","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4937734","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of MUSIC employing conjugate symmetric beamformers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of MUSIC employing conjugate symmetric beamformers","sourcePdf":"00370628.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090268S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8502","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"11","articleId":"370628","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":370630,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Problems arising from imperfect transmission of block-coded images result in lost blocks. The resulting image is flawed by the absence of square pixel regions that are notably perceived by human vision, even in real-time video sequences. Error concealment is aimed at masking the effect of missing blocks by use of temporal or spatial interpolation to create a subjectively acceptable approximation to the true error-free image. This paper presents a spatial interpolation algorithm that addresses concealment of lost image blocks using only intra-frame information. It attempts to utilize spatially correlated edge information from a large local neighborhood of surrounding pixels to restore missing blocks. The algorithm is a Gerchberg (1974) type spatial domain/spectral domain constraint-satisfying iterative process, and may be viewed as an alternating projections onto convex sets method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.370675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.370675","endPage":"477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8503/00370675.pdf","startPage":"470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Concealment of damaged block transform coded images using projections onto convex sets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370675/","displayDocTitle":"Concealment of damaged block transform coded images using projections onto convex sets","volume":"4","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4927016","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"18289995","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Concealment of damaged block transform coded images using projections onto convex sets","sourcePdf":"00370675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029657S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"288","articleId":"370675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":370676,"authors":[{"name":"O.

The ringing effects that occur in subband-based compression schemes are the major unpleasant distortions. A new set of two-band filter banks suitable for image coding applications is presented. The basic properties of these filters are linear phase, perfect reconstruction, asymmetric length, and maximum regularity. The better overall performances compared to the classical QMF subband filters are explained. The asymmetry of the filter lengths results in a better compaction of the energy, especially in the highpass subbands. Moreover, the quantization error is reduced due to the short lowpass synthesis filter. The undesirable ringing effect is considerably reduced due to the good step response of the synthesis lowpass filter. The proposed design takes into account the statistics of natural images and the effect of quantization errors in the reconstructed images, which explains the better coding performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Channel bank filters","Filter bank","Image reconstruction","Quantization","Student members","Nonlinear filters","Band pass filters","Compaction","Error analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","filtering theory","data compression","band-pass filters","low-pass filters","delay circuits","quantisation (signal)","digital filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["subband coding","asymmetrical filter banks","subband filters","image coding","ringing effects","subband-based compression","distortions","two-band filter banks","linear phase filters","perfect reconstruction","asymmetric length","maximum regularity","highpass subbands","quantization error","lowpass synthesis filter","step response","image statistics","image reconstruction"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.370676","startPage":"478","endPage":"485","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8503/00370676.pdf","doi":"10.1109/83.370676","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Subband coding of images using asymmetrical filter banks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Subband coding of images using asymmetrical filter banks","accessionNumber":"4927017","pubMedId":"18289996","publicationDate":"April 1995","volume":"4","issue":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370676/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Subband coding of images using asymmetrical filter banks","sourcePdf":"00370676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035578S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"24","articleId":"370676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":370677,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Wah Wong","affiliation":["Hewlett Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Ping Wah Wong","id":"37087164672"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"370677","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":87,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":242},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Estimation error","Projection algorithms","Gray-scale","Maximum likelihood detection","Smoothing methods","Image reconstruction","Mean square error methods","Quantization","Nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image reconstruction","error analysis","smoothing methods","filtering theory","adaptive signal processing","quantisation (signal)","maximum likelihood estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inverse halftoning","error diffused images","linear filtering","statistical smoothing","gray scale image reconstruction","projection operation","error diffusion kernel","binary image","projection algorithms","minimum mean square error","MMSE projection","maximum a posteriori probability projection","MAP projection","inverse quantization","adaptive signal processing","kernel estimation algorithm"]}],"abstract":"Two different approaches in the inverse halftoning of error-diffused images are considered. The first approach uses linear filtering and statistical smoothing that reconstructs a gray-scale image from a given error-diffused image. The second approach can be viewed as a projection operation, where one assumes the error diffusion kernel is known, and finds a gray-scale image that will be halftoned into the same binary image. Two projection algorithms, viz., minimum mean square error (MMSE) projection and maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) projection, that differ on the way an inverse quantization step is performed, are developed. Among the filtering and the two projection algorithms, MAP projection provides the best performance for inverse halftoning. Using techniques from adaptive signal processing, we suggest a method for estimating the error diffusion kernel from the given halftone. This means that the projection algorithms can be applied in the inverse halftoning of any error-diffused image without requiring any a priori information on the error diffusion kernel. It is shown that the kernel estimation algorithm combined with MAP projection provide the same performance in inverse halftoning compared to the case where the error diffusion kernel is known.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.370677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8503/00370677.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.370677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Inverse halftoning and kernel estimation for error diffusion","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370677/","displayDocTitle":"Inverse halftoning and kernel estimation for error diffusion","volume":"4","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4927018","pubMedId":"18289997","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Inverse halftoning and kernel estimation for error diffusion","sourcePdf":"00370677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.045848S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"87","articleId":"370677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":370679,"authors":[{"name":"H.

They have variable window size for removal of impulses while preserving sharpness. The first one, called the ranked-order based adaptive median filter (RAMF), is based on a test for the presence of impulses in the center pixel itself followed by a test for the presence of residual impulses in the median filter output. The second one, called the impulse size based adaptive median filter (SAMF), is based on the detection of the size of the impulse noise. It is shown that the RAMF is superior to the nonlinear mean L/sub p/ filter in removing positive and negative impulses while simultaneously preserving sharpness; the SAMF is superior to Lin's (1988) adaptive scheme because it is simpler with better performance in removing the high density impulsive noise as well as nonimpulsive noise and in preserving the fine details. Simulations on standard images confirm that these algorithms are superior to standard median filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/83.370679","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","startPage":"499","endPage":"502","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/8503/00370679.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.370679","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8503","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive median filters: new algorithms and results","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive filters","Impulse testing","Image processing","Decoding","Degradation","Image quality","Noise robustness","Nonlinear distortion","Smoothing methods","Research and development"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","adaptive signal processing","image processing","filtering theory","median filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image processing","algorithms","image models","impulse noise","variable window size","ranked-order based adaptive median filter","center pixel","residual impulses","median filter output","impulse size based adaptive median filter","SAMF","RAMF","image sharpness","nonimpulsive noise","simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive median filters: new algorithms and results","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4927019","pubMedId":"18289998","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370679/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive median filters: new algorithms and results","sourcePdf":"00370679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031988S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"693","articleId":"370679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":370698,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Theory, implementation, and experiments for a model-based A/F ratio control system using state-space control and estimation methods are presented. An excellent match of the in-cylinder A/F ratio with the desired A/F ratio can be achieved in spite of the time delay in the system. This is accomplished by compensating the air dynamics with a drive-by-wire throttle supported feedforward control, and the fuel dynamics with an observer-based feedback control. For fast correction of steady-state system errors, the control law is extended by learning control. The proposed method is applicable to multicylinder production engines. Experimental validation is made on a single-cylinder research engine, with A/F ratio feedback from either a linear or a nonlinear exhaust gas oxygen sensor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/87.370706","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","startPage":"22","endPage":"31","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.370706","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8504","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/8504/00370706.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Engines","Control system synthesis","Control systems","State estimation","Delay effects","Fuels","Feedback control","Steady-state","Error correction","Production"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internal combustion engines","state-space methods","delays","compensation","feedforward","feedback","road vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air-fuel ratio control","spark-ignition engines","estimation theory","strict emission standards","state-space control","state-space estimation","in-cylinder air/fuel ratio","compensation","drive-by-wire throttle supported feedforward control","observer-based feedback control","steady-state system errors","learning control","multicylinder production engines","exhaust gas oxygen sensor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Air-fuel ratio control in spark-ignition engines using estimation theory","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370706/","volume":"3","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"4922105","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Air-fuel ratio control in spark-ignition engines using estimation theory","sourcePdf":"00370706.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070033S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"53","articleId":"370706","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":370707,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Several important issues require further investigation, including long-term climatic effects, vehicle aging, car-to-car variations, the automation of the calibration procedure and implementation in the face of processor limitations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4922110","volume":"3","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Model based diagnosis for automotive engines-algorithm development and testing on a production vehicle","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Model based diagnosis for automotive engines-algorithm development and testing on a production vehicle","sourcePdf":"00370711.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035879S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"75","articleId":"370711","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-20"},{"_id":370714,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The controller relies on an accurate model of the suspension system. To reduce the error in the model, a standard parameter adaptation scheme, based on Lyapunov analysis, is introduced. A modified adaptation scheme, which enables the identification of parameters whose values change with regions of the state space, is then presented. These parameters are not restricted to being slowly time-varying as in the standard adaptation scheme; however, they are restricted to being constant or slowly time varying within regions of the state space. The adaptation algorithms are coupled with the control algorithm and the resulting system performance is analyzed experimentally. The performance is determined by the ability of the actuator output to track a specified force. The performance of the active system, with and without the adaptation, is analyzed. Simulation and experimental results show that the active system is better than a passive system in terms of improving the ride quality of the vehicle. Furthermore, both of the adaptive schemes improve performance, with the modified scheme giving the greater improvement in performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/87.370714","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology","pdfPath":"/iel4/87/8504/00370714.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/87.370714","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8504","startPage":"94","endPage":"101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonlinear adaptive control of active suspensions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=370714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear adaptive control of active suspensions","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/370714/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4922114","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear adaptive control of active suspensions","sourcePdf":"00370714.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040103S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8504","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"87","citationCount":"390","articleId":"370714","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":370718,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The architecture of DRNN is a modified model of the fully connected recurrent neural network with one hidden layer. The hidden layer is comprised of self-recurrent neurons, each feeding its output only into itself and not to other neurons in the hidden layer. An unknown plant is identified by a diagonal recurrent neuroidentifier (DRNI), and provides the sensitivity information of the plant to a diagonal recurrent neurocontroller (DRNC). A dynamic backpropagation algorithm (DBP) is used to train both DRNC and DRNI. The DRNN captures the dynamic nature of a system, and, since it is not fully connected, training is much faster than for the case of a fully connected recurrent neural network. For faster learning, the use of an adaptive learning rate that guarantees convergence is developed. The proposed approach is applied to numerical problems.

A robotics research arm, placed in contact with a single degree-of-freedom electromechanical environment dynamics emulator, is commanded to move through a desired trajectory.

The control strategy is developed within the general framework of nonlinear model-following control, and within attempts to minimize the total time for nullifying the deviations from the desired model behavior while ensuring a specified percentage of time on the sliding manifolds in order to exploit the disturbance attenuation features present during the sliding motions. These objectives are realized by tailoring an adaptation process that consists of appropriately adjusting the controller gains to keep the motion on the sliding manifolds, and of progressively updating the sliding manifold parameters. A rapid execution of the adaptation process is facilitated by a multilayer recurrent neural network with a supervised training algorithm. The resulting control scheme is decentralized and permits the design of independent joint controls. A quantitative performance evaluation of the neural network-based adaptive controller is given in various task scenarios such as regulation, trajectory tracking, and model following.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371247/","accessionNumber":"4740532","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A recurrent neural network-based adaptive variable structure model following control of multijointed robotic manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A recurrent neural network-based adaptive variable structure model following control of multijointed robotic manipulators","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00371247.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032943S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"8509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1040","citationCount":"2","articleId":"371247","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":371273,"authors":[{"name":"T.J.

Three existing ANN training strategies are reviewed within this framework, i.e., gradient-descent backpropagation, the extended Kalman algorithm, and the recursive least squares method. A strikingly different approach to error backpropagation is presented, resulting in the development of a novel method of backward signal propagation and target state generation for embedded layers. The proposed technique is suitable for implementation with a linear-Kalman based update algorithm and is applied with a time-varying method of covariance modification for the elimination of transients associated with initial conditions. Results from a nonlinear identification experiment demonstrate an increased rate of convergence in comparison with backpropagation. The new algorithm displayed similar rates of parameter convergence and a decreased computational overhead compared to the extended Kalman algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1992.371322","pdfPath":"/iel5/1040/8509/00371322.pdf","startPage":"2728","endPage":"2733 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1992.371322","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of artificial neural network parameters for nonlinear system identification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371322/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of artificial neural network parameters for nonlinear system identification","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4740457","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of artificial neural network parameters for nonlinear system identification","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00371322.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097048S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"8509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1040","citationCount":"2","articleId":"371322","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":371324,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

When a mobile robot moves from a point to a goal point, it is necessary to plan an optimal or feasible path for it, avoiding obstructions in its way and minimizing costs such as time, energy, and distance. This planning is referred to as selfish planning. When many robots move in the same space, it is necessary to select the most reasonable path so as to avoid collisions with other robots and to minimize the cost. This planning is referred to as coordinative planning. The GAs are search algorithms based on the mechanics of natural selection and natural genetics. The GAs are applied to both the selfish planning and the coordinative planning of multiple mobile robots.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/1040/8509/00371330.pdf","startPage":"2686","endPage":"2691 vol.3","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selfish and coordinative planning for multiple mobile robots by genetic algorithm","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1992.371330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8509","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1992.371330","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=371330","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371330/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","displayDocTitle":"Selfish and coordinative planning for multiple mobile robots by genetic algorithm","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4740449","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selfish and coordinative planning for multiple mobile robots by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00371330.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029357S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"8509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1040","citationCount":"27","articleId":"371330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":371334,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Two network architectures have been tested in simulation on real teleoperation data, and the one with the best performance has been implemented on a teleoperation system. During tests on actual telemanipulation tasks, the classifier had a lower recognition percentage than the simulated tests, but it showed an unexpected generalization capability.

New methods are presented for determining the structure of modeling uncertainty. The work uses a 17th order nonlinear jet engine simulation model to illustrate the methods proposed.

Several experiments have been conducted to show the reliability of the neurocontrol scheme. The experimental results also show that the neural-network-based processes are superior and robust.

The NN is used to model the resulting unknown control law. The approach is based on using the output error of the system to train the NN controller without the need to construct a separate model (NN or other type) for the unknown process dynamics. To implement such an approach, it is required that connection weights in the NN be estimated while the system is being controlled. As a result of the feedback of the unknown process dynamics, however, it is not possible to determine the gradient of the loss function for use in standard (backpropagation-type) weight estimation algorithms. Therefore, the authors consider the use of a new stochastic approximation algorithm for this weight estimation that is based on a simultaneous perturbation gradient approximation that only requires the system output error. It is shown that this algorithm can greatly enhance the efficiency over more standard stochastic approximation algorithms based on finite-difference gradient approximations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CDC.1992.371600","pdfPath":"/iel5/1040/8509/00371600.pdf","startPage":"878","endPage":"883 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the 31st IEEE Conference on Decision and Control","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CDC.1992.371600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8509","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Direct adaptive control of nonlinear systems using neural networks and stochastic approximation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","displayDocTitle":"Direct adaptive control of nonlinear systems using neural networks and stochastic approximation","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4735448","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Direct adaptive control of nonlinear systems using neural networks and stochastic approximation","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00371600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07041S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"8509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1040","citationCount":"18","articleId":"371600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":371603,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The control strategies are compared in an extensive test program involving sinusoidal position trajectory tracking experiments on a direct-drive DC motor.

The overall structure of the RHONN consists of dynamical elements distributed throughout the network in the form of dynamical neurons, which are interconnected by high-order connections. It is shown that if a sufficiently large number of high-order connections between neurons is allowed, the RHONN model is capable of approximating the input-output behavior of general dynamical systems to any degree of accuracy. Based on the linear-in-the-weights property of the RHONN model, the authors have developed identification schemes and derived weight adaptive laws for adjustment of the weights. The convergence and stability properties of these weight adaptive laws have been analyzed. In the case of no modeling error, the state error between the system and the RHONN model converges to zero asymptotically. If modeling errors are present, the sigma -modification is proposed as a method of guaranteeing the stability of the overall scheme. The feasibility of applying these techniques has been demonstrated by considering the identification of a simple rigid robotic system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371800/","accessionNumber":"4730144","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"16-18 Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Identification of nonlinear systems using new dynamic neural network structures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of nonlinear systems using new dynamic neural network structures","confLoc":"Tucson, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00371800.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037706S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"8509","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1040","citationCount":"24","articleId":"371800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":371801,"authors":[{"name":"R.M.

The identification procedure considered is based on a discrete-time formulation. Depending on the location of the adjustable parameters, networks are classified into linearly and nonlinearly parametrized networks. Based on this classification, a unified procedure for modeling discrete-time dynamical systems using online approximators is developed. The proposed identification methodology guarantees stability of the overall system even in the presence of modeling errors, and upper bounds for the average output error are obtained in terms of the modeling error.

This optimization includes the technology used to implement the digital circuits, the circuit style and topology, the architecture for implementing the circuits and at the highest level the algorithms that are being implemented. The most important technology consideration is the threshold voltage and its control which allows the reduction of supply voltage without significant impact on logic speed. Even further supply reductions can be made by the use of an architecture-based voltage scaling strategy, which uses parallelism and pipelining, to tradeoff silicon area and power reduction. Since energy is only consumed when capacitance is being switched power can be reduced by minimizing this capacitance through operation reduction choice of number representation, exploitation of signal correlations, resynchronization to minimize glitching, logic design, circuit design, and physical design. The low-power techniques that are presented have been applied to the design of a chipset for a portable multimedia terminal that supports pen input, speech I/O and full-motion video. The entire chipset that performs protocol conversion, synchronization, error correction, packetization, buffering, video decompression and D/A conversion operates from a 1.1 V supply and consumes less than 5 mW.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.371964","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.371964","startPage":"498","endPage":"523","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/8511/00371964.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Minimizing power consumption in digital CMOS circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371964/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Minimizing power consumption in digital CMOS circuits","volume":"83","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4949802","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Minimizing power consumption in digital CMOS circuits","sourcePdf":"00371964.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031378S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"619","articleId":"371964","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":371965,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The discussion includes a general description of power sources in a RAM chip, and covers both DRAMs and SRAMs. In DRAMs, successive circuit advancements have produced a power reduction equivalent to two to three orders of magnitude over the last decade for a fixed memory capacity chip. Coupled with the low-power advantage of CMOS circuits, two technologies have been the major contributors to power reduction: lower charging capacitance due to partial activation of multi-divided arrays that use multi-divisions of data and word lines; and lower operating voltage resulting from external power supply reduction, half-V/sub DD/ precharging and on-chip voltage down converting scheme. In SRAMs, partial activation of a multi-divided word line drastically reduces the dc current from the data-line load to the selected cell. In addition to advances in the sense amplifier circuit, an auto power down scheme that uses address transition detection for word driver and column circuitry further reduces the dc current. It is also shown that to design ultralow voltage DRAMs and SRAMs, the application of subthreshold current reduction circuits (such as source-gate back biasing) to cell and iterative circuit blocks will be indispensable in the future.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.371965","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.371965","startPage":"524","endPage":"543","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/8511/00371965.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Trends in low-power RAM circuit technologies","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371965/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Trends in low-power RAM circuit technologies","volume":"83","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4949803","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Trends in low-power RAM circuit technologies","sourcePdf":"00371965.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092982S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"169","articleId":"371965","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":371966,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

It is seen from this that when ICs enable a rethinking of the RF architecture, the wireless device can sometimes become significantly smaller, and consume much less power. Examples are taken from FM broadcast receivers, pagers, and cellular telephone handsets. Many semiconductor technologies are competing today to supply RF-ICs to cellular telephones. The various design styles and levels of integration are compared, with the conclusion that single-chip silicon transceivers, combined with architectures which substantially reduce off-chip passive components, will likely dominate digital cellular telephones in the near future. The survey also projects future trends for ICs for miniature spread-spectrum transceivers offering robust operation in the crowded spectrum. With sophistication in baseband digital signal processing, its increasing interaction with the RF sections, and with increasing experience in simplified radio architectures, all-CMOS radios appear promising in the 900 MHz to 2 GHz bands.

Issues such as battery life, thermal limits, packaging constraints and cooling options are becoming key factors in the success of a product. As a consequence, IC and system designers are beginning to see the impact of power on design area, design speed, design complexity and manufacturing cost. While process and voltage scaling can achieve significant power reductions, these are expensive strategies that require industry momentum, that only pay off in the long run. Technology independent gains for power come from the area of design for low power which has a much higher return on investment (ROI). But low power design is not only a new area but is also a complex endeavour requiring a broad range of synergistic capabilities from architecture/microarchitecture design to package design. It changes traditional IC design from a two-dimensional problem (Area/performance) to a three-dimensional one (Area/Performance/Power). This paper describes the CAD tools and methodologies required to effect efficient design for low power. It is targeted to a wide audience and tries to convey an understanding of the breadth of the problem. It explains the state of the art in CAD tools and methodologies. The paper is written in the form of a tutorial, making it easy to read by keeping the technical depth to a minimum while supplying a wealth of technical references. Simultaneously the paper identifies unresolved problems in an attempt to incite research in these areas. Finally an attempt is made to provide commercial CAD tool vendors with an understanding of the needs and time frames for new CAD tools supporting low power design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.371967","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8511","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.371967","endPage":"594","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/8511/00371967.pdf","startPage":"570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power conscious CAD tools and methodologies: a perspective","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371967/","displayDocTitle":"Power conscious CAD tools and methodologies: a perspective","volume":"83","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4949805","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power conscious CAD tools and methodologies: a perspective","sourcePdf":"00371967.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11057S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"133","articleId":"371967","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":371968,"authors":[{"name":"B.

This paper emphasizes the importance of optimizing the choice of power-supply voltage. Two CMOS device and voltage scaling scenarios are described. One optimized for highest speed and the other trading off speed improvement for much lower power. It is shown that the low power scenario is quite close to the original constant electric-field scaling theory. CMOS technologies ranging from 0.25 /spl mu/m channel length at 2.5 V down to sub-0.1 /spl mu/m at 1 V are presented and power density is compared for the two scenarios. Scaling of the threshold voltage along with the power supply voltage will lead to a substantial rise in standby power compared to active power and some tradeoffs of performance and/or changes in design methods must be made. Key technology elements and their impact on scaling are discussed. It is shown that a speed improvement of about 7/spl times/ and over two orders of magnitude improvement in power-delay product (mW/MIPS) are expected by scaling of bulk CMOS down to the sub-0.1 /spl mu/m regime as compared with today's high performance 0.6 /spl mu/m devices at 5 V. However, the power density rises by a factor of 4/spl times/ for the high-speed scenario. The status of the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) approach to scaled CMOS is also reviewed, showing the potential for about 3/spl times/ savings in power compared to the bulk case at the same speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","startPage":"595","endPage":"606","doi":"10.1109/5.371968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.371968","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/8511/00371968.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CMOS scaling for high performance and low power-the next ten years","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"CMOS scaling for high performance and low power-the next ten years","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4949806","volume":"83","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CMOS scaling for high performance and low power-the next ten years","sourcePdf":"00371968.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046062S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"250","articleId":"371968","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":371969,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.C.

Small form factors, portability, and low cost will require low power operation. While continued scaling of silicon technology to dimensions below quarter micron devices and interconnections appears technically feasible, higher levels of integration and operation at higher speed have been driving the power consumption of logic chips up instead of down. This paper discusses how scaled submicron silicon technology can provide leverage to reduce power, while gaining in throughput for logic chips, and in capacity for memory functions. Strong reductions in voltage supply have to accompany shrinking dimensions. Materials limits such as tunneling currents through ultra-thin silicon-dioxide gate dielectrics and electromigration in minimum pitch interconnections emerge to be key challenges to realize low power 0.1 /spl mu/m level CMOS circuits. A more than 10/spl times/ gain in productivity as measured by the energy*delay product can be realized by shrinking from 0.5-0.125 /spl mu/m CMOS device technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.371969","startPage":"607","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/8511/00371969.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.371969","endPage":"618","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Technology leverage for ultra-low power information systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371969/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Technology leverage for ultra-low power information systems","volume":"83","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4949807","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Technology leverage for ultra-low power information systems","sourcePdf":"00371969.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05639S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"24","articleId":"371969","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":371970,"authors":[{"name":"J.D.

Historically, the most demanding applications of low power microelectronics have been battery operated products such as wrist watches, hearing aids, implantable cardiac pacemakers, pocket calculators, pagers, cellular telephones and prospectively the hand-held multi-media terminal However, in the early 1990's low power microelectronics rapidly evolved from a substantial tributary to the mainstream of microelectronics. The principal reasons for this transformation were the increasing packing density of transistors and increasing clock frequencies of CMOS microchips pushing heat removal and power distribution to the forefront of the problems confronting the advance of microelectronics. The distinctive thesis of this discussion is that future opportunities for low power gigascale integration (GSI) will be governed by a hierarchy of theoretical and practical limits whose levels can be codified as: (1) fundamental, (2) material, (3) device, (4) circuit, and (5) system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371970/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","volume":"83","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4949808","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Low power microelectronics: retrospect and prospect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low power microelectronics: retrospect and prospect","sourcePdf":"00371970.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071481S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"210","articleId":"371970","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":371971,"authors":[{"name":"E.P.

This paper describes an integrated approach to the design of a portable video-on-demand system capable of delivering high-quality image and video data in a wireless communication environment. The discussion will focus on both the algorithm and circuit design techniques developed for implementing a low-power video compression/decompression system at power levels that are two orders of magnitude below existing solutions. This low-power video compression system not only provides a compression efficiency similar to industry standards, but also maintains a high degree of error tolerance to guard against transmission errors often encountered in wireless communication. The required power reduction can best be attained through reformulating compression algorithms for energy conservation.

Growth in new systems once in production, is also slow, depending upon the development of new devices which need their performance characteristics. This has been true, in particular for lithium cells operating at 3 V. Older electrochemical systems such as C-Zn, alkaline, Zn-air, NiCd, and lead-acid continue to get better, and maintain the market for devices which can use them. Primary lithium batteries are growing in use as new devices are designed around their higher voltage and superior shelf life. The Li-MnO/sub 2/ system dominates the commercial marker. At least 16 manufacturers produce many sizes and configurations from high rate \"D\" cells to 50 mAh thin, flat cells. Two new secondary (rechargeable) systems, nickel-metal hydride and lithium ion, have recently been introduced They are growing at a rapid rate in response to environmental concerns and the need for higher energy density. Other secondary systems such as Zn-air and lithium-polymer electrolyte are nearing commercial production. Environmental regulations continue to impact battery use and disposal, leading to more interest in secondary systems which can be reused many times before disposal. Mercury has largely been banned from use in primary batteries, both as a corrosion inhibitor for zinc and as a cathode in the mercuric oxide cell. Existing and emerging battery systems are discussed in terms of energy content, shelf and cycle life and other characteristics.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/5.371974","startPage":"687","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel3/5/8511/00371974.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/5.371974","endPage":"693","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Batteries for low power electronics","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371974/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Batteries for low power electronics","volume":"83","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4949812","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Batteries for low power electronics","sourcePdf":"00371974.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05083S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8511","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"120","articleId":"371974","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":371992,"authors":[{"name":"P.M.

The algorithm is based on a finite element (FE) representation which is coupled to a boundary element (BE) formulation for the forward solution of the electric fields; together these are termed the hybrid element method. It utilizes FE discretization of only the area of interest while incorporating the RE method to match the conditions of the homogeneous background region extending to infinity. This paper presents image reconstruction for the 2D TM polarization case where two classes of dielectric distributions are studied which demonstrate the flexibility of this method along with some of the difficulties associated with larger imaging problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.371992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8512/00371992.pdf","startPage":"239","endPage":"247","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.371992","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8512","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-dimensional hybrid element image reconstruction for TM illumination","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=371992","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/371992/","displayDocTitle":"Two-dimensional hybrid element image reconstruction for TM illumination","volume":"43","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4935966","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-dimensional hybrid element image reconstruction for TM illumination","sourcePdf":"00371992.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078168S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8512","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"67","articleId":"371992","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":372015,"authors":[{"name":"W.Y.

OFDM/COFDM has already been implemented in digital audio broadcasting and is being considered for terrestrial digital television and HDTV broadcasting. The advantages of COFDM claimed by the advocates in Europe have also caught the attention of US broadcasters and generated enthusiasm although a digital modulation technique called 8-VSB has been selected by the FCC Advisory Committee on Advanced Television Service (ACATS) for the final testing. There is considerable debate in the industry over the use of COFDM vs. VSB or QAM for terrestrial HDTV broadcasting. In this paper, the history of research and development on OFDM and COFDM is reviewed. Then, the basic principles, performance and implementation of OFDM and COFDM are examined. Analysis is given to enable the selection of key elements for meeting the constraints of the required applications. Based on the ATV channel model, performance expectation of COFDM under imperfect channel conditions and implementation issues are examined in details.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.372015","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.372015","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel3/11/8513/00372015.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"COFDM: an overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"COFDM: an overview","volume":"41","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4930846","publicationDate":"March 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"COFDM: an overview","sourcePdf":"00372015.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06915S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"595","articleId":"372015","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":372016,"authors":[{"name":"K.J.

Both QAM and VSB are bandwidth efficient, and have the same bandwidth efficiency. Detailed calculations and simulations of QAM and VSB transmission on hybrid fiber/coax are reported here. It is shown that, since VSB has a higher symbol rate, it has at most 1/2 dB less received SNR than QAM at low frequencies because of dispersion and symbol timing jitter. This difference is negligible. Vendors proposing VSB recover the carrier with a pilot tone and a PLL, and vendors proposing QAM use all-digital data-directed carrier recovery. Simulations reported here show that QAM and VSB have very similar carrier recovery performance. It is concluded that for hybrid fiber/coax, VSB and QAM have practically the same overall performance, and the choice between these transmission systems should be based on considerations other than performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/11.372016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting","pdfPath":"/iel3/11/8513/00372016.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"16","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/11.372016","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8513","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of QAM and VSB for hybrid fiber/coax: digital transmission","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372016","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372016/","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of QAM and VSB for hybrid fiber/coax: digital transmission","volume":"41","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4930847","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of QAM and VSB for hybrid fiber/coax: digital transmission","sourcePdf":"00372016.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027684S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8513","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"11","citationCount":"9","articleId":"372016","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":372017,"authors":[{"name":"S.S.

The encoding and decoding algorithms have been designed with the help of a linear operator that can be conveniently realized with a maximum length group CA.

There are different ways of organizing the two copies of the data across a disk array. This paper compares strategies for striping data of the two copies in the context of database applications. By keeping both copies active, we explore strategies that can take advantage of the additional copy to improve not only availability, but also performance during both normal and failure modes. We consider the effects of small and large stripe sizes on the performance of disk arrays with two active copies of data under a mixed workload of queries and transactions with a skewed access pattern. We propose a dual (hybrid) striping strategy which uses different stripe sizes for the two copies and a disk queuing policy designed to exploit this organization for optimal performance. An analytical model is devised for this scheme, by treating the individual disks as independent, and applying an M/G/1 queuing model. Disks on which a large query scan is running are modeled by a variation of the queue with permanent customers, which leads to an iterative functional equation for the query scan delay distribution. A solution for this equation is given. The results are validated against simulations. And are shown to match well. Comparison with uniform striping strategies show that the dual striping scheme yields the most stable performance in a variety of workloads, out-performing the uniform striping strategy using either mirrored or chained dc-clustering under both normal and failure mode operations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analytic modeling and comparisons of striping strategies for replicated disk arrays","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/12.372034","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/12/8514/00372034.pdf","startPage":"419","endPage":"433","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.372034","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8514","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372034","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372034/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Analytic modeling and comparisons of striping strategies for replicated disk arrays","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"44","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4919853","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analytic modeling and comparisons of striping strategies for replicated disk arrays","sourcePdf":"00372034.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051835S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"23","articleId":"372034","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":372037,"authors":[{"name":"W.F.

For IEEE single precision numbers our initial estimates indicate that we can calculate the basic elementary functions, namely reciprocal, square root, logarithm, exponential, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions, within the latency of two to four floating point multiplies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.372037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel3/12/8514/00372037.pdf","startPage":"453","endPage":"457","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.372037","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8514","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast evaluation of the elementary functions in single precision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372037","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372037/","displayDocTitle":"Fast evaluation of the elementary functions in single precision","volume":"44","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4919856","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast evaluation of the elementary functions in single precision","sourcePdf":"00372037.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026351S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8514","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"48","articleId":"372037","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":372063,"authors":[{"name":"D.C.

The trap generation was accompanied by the motion of atoms which resulted in permanent traps fixed in space. Breakdown occurred when the local density of traps exceeded a critical density. The charge state of these traps could easily be changed by application of low voltages after the high voltage stresses. The energy levels of the traps varied depending on the probability of trap generation.

It was concluded that the wearout process in oxides thinner than 22 nm was determined by the electric fields applied to the oxides and not by the passage of currents through the oxides.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/16.372082","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel3/16/8515/00372082.pdf","startPage":"760","endPage":"772","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.372082","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8515","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High field related thin oxide wearout and breakdown","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372082","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372082/","displayDocTitle":"High field related thin oxide wearout and breakdown","volume":"42","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4930876","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High field related thin oxide wearout and breakdown","sourcePdf":"00372082.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066332S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"91","articleId":"372082","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":372090,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The method is based on the fact that the real part of the feedback admittance is mainly caused by the source and the gate resistance. This enables the analytical calculation of R/sub S/ at any measured frequency with high accuracy. Taking the ratio of R/sub G/ with regard to R/sub S/ as the only optimizing parameter, it is possible to calculate quickly an equivalent circuit the elements of which do not depend on starting values. The equivalent circuit fits the measured S-parameters very well and allows a physical interpretation of the calculated elements.

Microshield is a quasi-planar, half-shielded design which uses a thin dielectric membrane (1.5 /spl mu/m) to support the conducting lines. This approach provides a nearly homogeneous, air-filled environment and thus allows extremely broad-band TEM operation. This paper examines the conductor loss and effective dielectric constant of microshield lines and presents results on transitions to conventional coplanar waveguide, right-angle bends, different stub configurations, and lowpass and bandpass filters.

Moreover, a criterion for the choice of the optimal number of independent columns is proposed, and the possibility of making this choice less critical by using a multiview version of the method is explored. Finally, a modified procedure is presented that further increases the range from which to choose the number of independent columns that allows one to achieve acceptable reconstructions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel3/22/8516/00372110.pdf","startPage":"632","endPage":"640","doi":"10.1109/22.372110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.372110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the use of regularization techniques in numerical inverse-scattering solutions for microwave imaging applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372110/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"On the use of regularization techniques in numerical inverse-scattering solutions for microwave imaging applications","publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4919835","isJournal":true,"volume":"43","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the use of regularization techniques in numerical inverse-scattering solutions for microwave imaging applications","sourcePdf":"00372110.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048882S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"25","articleId":"372110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":372113,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

The approach, called state transition analysis, models penetrations as a series of state changes that lead from an initial secure state to a target compromised state. State transition diagrams, the graphical representation of penetrations, identify precisely the requirements for and the compromise of a penetration and present only the critical events that must occur for the successful completion of the penetration. State transition diagrams are written to correspond to the states of an actual computer system, and these diagrams form the basis of a rule based expert system for detecting penetrations, called the state transition analysis tool (STAT). The design and implementation of a Unix specific prototype of this expert system, called USTAT, is also presented. This prototype provides a further illustration of the overall design and functionality of this intrusion detection approach. Lastly, STAT is compared to the functionality of comparable intrusion detection tools.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/32.372146","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/32/8518/00372146.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/32.372146","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","startPage":"181","endPage":"199","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State transition analysis: a rule-based intrusion detection approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372146","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"State transition analysis: a rule-based intrusion detection approach","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372146/","volume":"21","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4913763","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State transition analysis: a rule-based intrusion detection approach","sourcePdf":"00372146.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04098S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"370","articleId":"372146","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":372149,"authors":[{"name":"W.J.

Our development environment, BEST (Blackboard based Expert Systems Toolkit), is aimed to provide the ability to produce large scale, evolvable, heterogeneous intelligent systems. BEST incorporates the best of multiple programming paradigms in order to avoid restricting users to a single way of expressing either knowledge or data. It combines rule based programming, object oriented programming, logic programming, procedural programming and blackboard modelling in a single architecture for knowledge engineering, so that the user can tailor a style of programming to his application, using any or arbitrary combinations of methods to provide a complete solution. The deep integration of all these techniques yields a toolkit more effective even for a specific single application than any technique in isolation or collections of multiple techniques less fully integrated. Within the basic, knowledge based programming paradigm, BEST offers a multiparadigm language for representing complex knowledge, including incomplete and uncertain knowledge. Its problem solving facilities include truth maintenance, inheritance over arbitrary relations, temporal and hypothetical reasoning, opportunistic control, automatic partitioning and scheduling and both blackboard and distributed problem solving paradigms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372151/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4913768","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"21","issue":"3","displayDocTitle":"Integrating multiple paradigms within the blackboard framework","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Integrating multiple paradigms within the blackboard framework","sourcePdf":"00372151.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029075S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8518","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"28","articleId":"372151","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":372197,"authors":[{"name":"J.C.

Wide-scale deployment of SONET equipment and the use of SONET line timing for reference distribution will eventually provide improved timing performance in terms of both wander and jitter. One of the main motivations for developing the SONET architecture was to establish standards for interconnecting optical transmission equipment from different suppliers. In the process of establishing the SONET standard other (e.g. synchronization) technical issues were addressed. The article compares the existing (asynchronous) network architecture with the new (synchronous) architecture in terms of their respective performance in transporting the clock rates of tributary digital signals. Of primary interest is the timing quality of a first level digital signal such as the North American DS1 signal or the ITU-T (formerly CCITT) El signal. Although the new architecture offers eventual promise in solving numerous timing and interfacing problems for such tributary signals, the new equipment must necessarily co-exist and inter-operate with the existing facilities. Thus, another major topic of the article concerns the performance of interim networks with mixtures of asynchronous and synchronous multiplexing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372197/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"33","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4936088","displayDocTitle":"Digital network synchronization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digital network synchronization","sourcePdf":"00372197.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038248S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8519","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"35","citationCount":"30","articleId":"372197","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":372347,"authors":[{"name":"R.B.

Intel's competitors may rejoice at the industry giant's technical and public relations missteps, but they too must worry about damage done to customer confidence, shuddering at the prospect of taking a similar public pratfall. And consumers, justified or not, have new reliability worries with every new product release. Intel recently adopted a \"no questions asked\" replacement policy for defective Pentium chips, reversing its earlier stance. As part of a new commitment to openness, Intel has posted a variety of documents on its World Wide Web home page (http://www.intel.com) describing the flaw, analysing its severity, and providing replacement procedures. Industry observers have pointed to the benefits that will come from Intel's woes: more openness by manufacturers, better understanding among consumers of the problems facing chip makers, and greater emphasis on testing. For chip makers and computer users alike, it remains then to calculate the lessons learned.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372360/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4929841","volume":"15","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Pentium FDIV flaw-lessons learned","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pentium FDIV flaw-lessons learned","sourcePdf":"00372360.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063977S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8521","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"40","citationCount":"12","articleId":"372360","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":372366,"authors":[{"name":"P.C.

Circuit performance measures are modeled as response surfaces of the designable and uncontrollable (noise) parameters. Worst-case analysis proceeds by first computing the worst-case circuit performance value and then determining the worst-case noise parameter values by solving a nonlinear programming problem. A new circuit optimization technique is developed to find an optimal design point at which all of the circuit specifications are met under worst-case conditions. This worst-case design optimization method is formulated as a constrained multicriteria optimization. The methodologies described in this paper are applied to several VLSI circuits to demonstrate their accuracy and efficiency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/8522/00372370.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"492","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/43.372370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.372370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Worst-case analysis and optimization of VLSI circuit performances","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Very large scale integration","Circuit optimization","Circuit noise","Design optimization","Circuit analysis","Optimization methods","Noise measurement","Response surface methodology","Circuit analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear programming","circuit optimisation","integrated circuit modelling","circuit analysis computing","circuit CAD","integrated circuit noise","integrated circuit design","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["worst-case analysis","optimization","VLSI circuit performances","circuit performance measures","response surfaces","nonlinear programming problem","constrained multicriteria optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Worst-case analysis and optimization of VLSI circuit performances","volume":"14","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4934843","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Worst-case analysis and optimization of VLSI circuit performances","sourcePdf":"00372370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029594S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"80","articleId":"372370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-22"},{"_id":372374,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The code considered here prohibits isolated \"one's\" (the 010 pattern) from appearing in the transmitted sequence.

The frequency noise spectral density of solid state lasers is modeled to contain a white component, a 1/f component, and a strong 1/f/sup 2/ component at the laser output. This model is verified and the spectral content of each component is measured using an open-loop RF frequency discriminator. The choice of loop filter is made by considering the frequency noise components, transient effects, and the loop damping factor /spl zeta/. The total phase error variance as a function of loop bandwidth is displayed for several values of carrier signal-to-noise ratio for the measured frequency noise spectrum. Optimal loop bandwidth is also calculated as a function of carrier signal-to-noise ratio. An OPLL experiment is performed, and measured phase error variance is compared with the theoretical predictions using the measured frequency noise spectrum. The results show that the measured phase error variance closely matches the theoretical predictions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372415/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4930511","volume":"13","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) for an amplitude modulated communications link using solid-state lasers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical phase-locked loop (OPLL) for an amplitude modulated communications link using solid-state lasers","sourcePdf":"00372415.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04044S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"8","articleId":"372415","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":372416,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

Previous research into CDMA has centered on completely coherent detection, that is, when the phases of all users in the system are known or tracked. While coherent detection is a reasonable assumption in many radio frequency systems, semiconductor lasers suffer from serious phase variation that makes tracking of all phases difficult to accomplish. This paper examines the effects of phase drift on several multiuser detectors for binary phase shift keying (BPSK), as well as two detectors for binary frequency shift keying (BFSK). It is shown that when the desired user's phase can be tracked, BPSK match filtering offers better bit error rates than BFSK, and closed form solutions for the asymptotic error probabilities are derived. When there is no phase tracking, it is shown that the probability of error of the multiuser detectors approaches one half. The analysis is based on a proof of the asymptotic normality of the interference caused by even a single undesired user. All asymptotic results are for infinitely long spreading codes that can be modeled as a random sequence of plus and minus ones. Whether or not the desired user's phase is tracked, all receivers examined suffer from the near-far problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.372416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/8524/00372416.pdf","startPage":"577","endPage":"591","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.372416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8524","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of laser phase drift on coherent optical CDMA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372416/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Effects of laser phase drift on coherent optical CDMA","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4930512","volume":"13","issue":"3","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of laser phase drift on coherent optical CDMA","sourcePdf":"00372416.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05637S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8524","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"19","articleId":"372416","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":372417,"authors":[{"name":"H.M.H.

Upper and lower bounds on the bit error probability for PPM-CDMA systems are derived under the above considerations. The effect of both background and thermal noise is neglected in our analysis. Performance comparison between the number-state and coherent-state OOK/PPM-CDMA networks is also presented. Our results demonstrate that the number-state system requires less than half the energy consumed by the coherent-state one in order to attain the same performance.

Two oscillating frequencies corresponding to two orthogonal linear polarization states of the laser emissions have been observed. The orientations of the two linearly polarized emissions were found parallel to the Hi-Bi fiber axes, respectively. Laser thresholds, slope efficiencies and differences between these frequencies were found to depend on the conditions of the Bragg grating inscription. Multimode single polarization Hi-Bi fiber lasers using two Bragg gratings were fabricated and characterized for the first time to our best knowledge. Wavelength tuning of this single polarization fiber laser has been demonstrated under temperature rise of the two gratings.

A prototype is constructed using the previously proposed techniques that attain low insertion loss and polarization independent operation. It has 16 channels (N=16) with a spacing of 0.8 mn, or 100 GHz, in the 1.55-/spl mu/m band. Frequency relation between input and output ports, free spectral range, and passband width are determined. A demonstration of IM-DD pulse transmission shows that there is no degradation of bit error rate resulting from the finite passband width and crosstalk of the multiplexer.

We propose an alternative approach to the usual concatenation of offset line segments and arc of circles that is geometrically less constrictive and more versatile. We also propose an adapted pure bend loss reduction mechanism that relies on a continuous widening of the waveguide together with the reduction of transition loss through curvature adaptation. The numerical results presented here show that this method can improve the loss figures and ease the burden of waveguide path design.

In such systems, that the authors refer to as frequency-encoded CDMA (FE-CDMA) systems, the coding is done in the frequency domain while in the usual CDMA systems the code multiplies the modulation signal in the time domain. They present a new type of FE-CDMA system, based on encoding noncoherent broadband sources. They discuss the advantages of the system compared to other optical CDMA systems and present its performance. They show that very efficient, low-cost, CDMA systems can be obtained with an aggregate throughput of many gigabits per second. Also, for this system, the spreading gain of CDMA is independent of the modulation bandwidth. Hence, the system can accommodate variable bit rates, naturally.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical code-division-multiplexed systems based on spectral encoding of noncoherent sources","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","doi":"10.1109/50.372451","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/8525/00372451.pdf","startPage":"534","endPage":"545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.372451","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8525","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372451","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372451/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optical code-division-multiplexed systems based on spectral encoding of noncoherent sources","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"13","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4935609","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical code-division-multiplexed systems based on spectral encoding of noncoherent sources","sourcePdf":"00372451.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052449S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8525","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"279","articleId":"372451","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":372465,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Several FET-SEED receiver arrays were tested and displayed a mean response of /spl sim/0.7 mV//spl mu/W, and were capable of >100 Mbps per channel operation. The mean receiver sensitivity for a BER of <10/sup -9/ was calculated from the measured noise spectrum to be -26.8 dBm at the system design rate of 40 Mbps (18 k-22 MHz bandwidth), and -23.2 dBm for a 100 Mbps rate (dc-66 MHz bandwidth). A sensitivity of approximately -25 dBm for the 40 Mbps rate was confirmed using a bit-error-rate test set. The theoretical noise is compared to measured values with good agreement assuming a FET channel noise factor of 1.4. The 1/f noise corner frequency of /spl sim/13 MHz was found to cause a /spl sim/1.2 dB degradation in sensitivity for the 100 Mbps rate. The differential amplifier mean dc output offset voltage was measured to be 10 mV, and displayed a large sigma due to parameter variations in the active devices.

Although the degradation of linear drain current is significantly reduced with increasing stress temperature, the degradation of saturation drain current is enhanced for high temperature stress.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a method by which characteristics better than those by conventional methods are obtained using an algorithm simpler than that of conventional methods. The experiments show that the purpose is achieved and the proposed method offers a total harmonic distortion of 0.6% of the output voltage waveform at a full nonlinear load. The analysis shows that the stability of the method is sufficient. Three features of the method are: (a) a capacitor current observer for stabilization and a disturbance observer for robustness are used to compensate the time lag by the computation and the disturbances, in a minor loop of the capacitor current through an inductor-capacitor filter of the inverter; (b) new models of the inverter and the disturbances are established to simplify these observers; and (c) the output voltage control loop can be designed easily and exactly because the minor loop realizes a rapid and robust control of the current.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/63.372604","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel3/63/8530/00372604.pdf","startPage":"196","endPage":"204","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/63.372604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8530","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microprocessor based robust digital control for UPS with three-phase PWM inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372604/","displayDocTitle":"Microprocessor based robust digital control for UPS with three-phase PWM inverter","volume":"10","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4908302","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microprocessor based robust digital control for UPS with three-phase PWM inverter","sourcePdf":"00372604.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029248S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8530","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"103","articleId":"372604","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":372652,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Jiu Wang","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, USA"],"lastName":"Chia-Jiu Wang","id":"37087373609"},{"name":"P.N.

Rugged terrain and geographical layout cause some sections of power transmission lines to be difficult to reach. Therefore, robustness of the accurate fault location determination under a variety of power system operating constraints and fault conditions is an important requirement. This article introduces a unique concept of high-speed fault location that can be implemented either as a simple add-on to the digital fault recorders (DFRs) or as a stand-alone new relaying function. This advanced concept is based on the use of voltage and current samples that are synchronously taken at both ends of a transmission line. This sampling technique can be made readily available in some new DFR designs incorporating receivers for accurate sampling clock synchronization using the satellite Global Positioning System (GPS).<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Fault location","Power transmission lines","Synchronization","Power system relaying","Global Positioning System","Layout","Robustness","Power system faults","Digital relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power transmission lines","fault location","power system relaying","power system measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault location","transmission line faults","synchronized sampling","high-speed fault location","digital fault recorders","relaying function","current sampling","voltage sampling","sampling clock synchronization","satellite Global Positioning System"]}],"doi":"10.1109/67.372673","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computer Applications in Power","pdfPath":"/iel3/67/8533/00372673.pdf","startPage":"30","endPage":"33","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8533","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/67.372673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronized sampling improves fault location","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372673","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Synchronized sampling improves fault location","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372673/","volume":"8","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4937247","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronized sampling improves fault location","sourcePdf":"00372673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.024436S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8533","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"67","citationCount":"14","articleId":"372673","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":372675,"authors":[{"name":"H.L.

Pump power modulation results in a low-pass transfer of modulation to signals amplified in the PDFFA. Low-frequency compression of the PDFFA input/output signal transfer characteristic has been observed. Due to a relatively long lifetime of the /sup 1/G/sub 4/ metastable level, multichannel crosstalk lower than 30 dB has been calculated for modulation frequencies higher than 600 kHz. Response of the PDFFA toward a low-frequency signal square pulse exhibits a characteristic overshoot that originates from the PDFFA saturation by the amplified signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber amplifiers","Equations","Pulse modulation","Crosstalk","Laser excitation","Pump lasers","Absorption","Optical fiber communication","Gain","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zirconium compounds","barium compounds","lanthanum compounds","aluminium compounds","sodium compounds","praseodymium","fibre lasers","optical pumping","laser theory","optical crosstalk","optical pulse compression","modelling","optical modulation","frequency response","optical saturation","radiative lifetimes","metastable states","optical fibre communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gain dynamics","Pr/sup 3+/-doped fluoride fiber amplifiers","large-signal model","four-level laser system","time variation effects","low frequency response characteristics","two-channel crosstalk","transient effects","praseodymium-doped fluoride fiber amplifiers","pump power modulation","low-pass transfer","low-frequency compression","input/output signal transfer characteristic","relatively long lifetime","/sup 1/G/sub 4/ metastable level","multichannel crosstalk","modulation frequencies","low-frequency signal square pulse","PDFFA saturation","amplified signal","600 kHz"]}],"doi":"10.1109/68.372752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel3/68/8535/00372752.pdf","startPage":"299","endPage":"302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/68.372752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of gain dynamics in Pr/sup 3+/-doped fluoride fiber amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372752","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of gain dynamics in Pr/sup 3+/-doped fluoride fiber amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372752/","volume":"7","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4908855","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of gain dynamics in Pr/sup 3+/-doped fluoride fiber amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00372752.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029935S","chronDate":"March  1995","isNumber":"8535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"10","articleId":"372752","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":372753,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Traditionally, this task has been accomplished by distributing the output of a central oscillator over a tree-like network, with repeaters at necessary intervals. While straightforward in concept, this method suffers from poor reliability, poor scalability and high skew. In this paper, we present an alternative approach-Distributed Synchronous Clocking-that maintains the simplicity of synchronous operation without suffering the drawbacks of centralized clocking. A network of independent oscillators takes the place of the centralized clock source, providing separate clock signals to the physically distant parts of a computing system. A distributed error correction algorithm effects global phase alignment by utilizing Local comparisons of neighboring oscillator phase. In contrast to centralized clock distribution, distributed clocking has the inherent potential for complete scalability and graceful degradation. However, because oscillator phase is a modular quantity, a naive implementation of distributed synchronous clocking can suffer from mode-lock-the trapping of local oscillator phase in undesirable stable equilibria where global phase is not aligned. We present a simple method for eliminating this problem in k-ary Cartesian meshes and give a proof of its correctness for two-dimensional networks. An electronic implementation is also presented and several engineering issues relating to error tolerance are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.372779","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/8536/00372779.pdf","startPage":"314","endPage":"328","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.372779","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8536","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed synchronous clocking","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=372779","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372779/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed synchronous clocking","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4914899","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed synchronous clocking","sourcePdf":"00372779.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026717S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8536","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"65","articleId":"372779","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":372792,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Assuming infinite number of processors, the compile time schedule is found using a new concept of the threshold of a task that quantifies a trade-off between the schedule-length and the degree of parallelism. The schedule is found to minimize either the schedule length or the number of required processors and it satisfies: A feasibility condition which guarantees that the schedule delay of a task from its earliest start time is below the threshold, and an optimality condition which uses a merit function to decide the best task-processor match for a set of tasks competing for a given processor. At run time, the tasks are merged producing a schedule for a smaller number of available processors. This allows the program to be scaled down to the processors actually available at run time. Usefulness of this scheduling heuristic has been demonstrated by incorporating the scheduler in the compiler backend for targeting Sisal (Streams and Iterations in a Single Assignment Language) on iPSC/860.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372792/","volume":"6","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4932115","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A scalable scheduling scheme for functional parallelism on distributed memory multiprocessor systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A scalable scheduling scheme for functional parallelism on distributed memory multiprocessor systems","sourcePdf":"00372792.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052546S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8537","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"36","articleId":"372792","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":372795,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Finite wordlength implementations which invoke quantization either before or after multiplication, and possibly include error feedback, are represented in a unified framework. This framework is used to pose and solve four different optimal realization problems. These problems are formulated in a closed loop context, which contains open loop applications (filtering/estimation) as special cases. Our results may be used to find optimal realizations for the implementation of multivariable feedback controllers, or for the implementation of multivariable filters/estimators. Optimal realizations are derived based on either an H/sub 2/ or H/sub /spl infin// roundoff noise gain subject to either H/sub 2/ or H/sub /spl infin// scaling constraints. The H/sub 2/ noise gain measures the departure from the ideal closed loop response (no signal quantization) when the spectral properties of the quantization error are known. The H/sub /spl infin// noise gain measures worst-case deviation from ideal response when the variance of the quantization error is bounded but the spectral properties are otherwise unknown. The H/sub 2/ scaling constraints limit the size of the quantized internal signals when the spectral properties of the exogenous input to the closed loop system are known, while H/sub /spl infin// scaling restricts the maximum possible size of the internal signals when the spectral properties of the exogenous input are not precisely known. One of the optimization problems has a well-known analytical solution; the other three are reduced to the problem of minimizing a linear function subject to affine matrix inequality constraints, which is a convex optimization problem whose global optimum may be readily found.

The analysis presented here takes into account these important parameters which affect the multiplier performance. Design and performance curves are given and discussed for the case of the RF choke, shunt capacitor, series-tuned configuration. It is seen that the multiplier performance is strongly affected by both of Q-factor and switching device ON resistance. Also, it is shown that the optimum operation of frequency multiplier (that is voltage across switch and its derivative equal to zero when the switch turns ON) is not realizable for low Q values.

No external measurement hardware is needed.

The pulse shift causes a nonlinear intersymbol interference (ISI) on the readback signal. In this paper, a Volterra-DFE, in which a Volterra filter is used in the feedback section of decision feedback structure, is proposed to equalize the nonlinear ISI. By theoretical analysis, the minimum mean squared error (MSE) of the Volterra-DFE is found to be a function of sampling phase. This will affect the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the playback system. A baud-rate timing recovery system in conjunction with a channel estimator is used to operate the sampling clock on the optimum phase.

In this paper, the alternation theorem is extended from the real-only to the complex case. The complex FIR filter design problem is reformulated so that it clearly satisfies the Haar condition of Chebyshev approximation. An efficient exchange algorithm is derived for designing complex FIR filters in the Chebyshev sense. By transforming the complex error function, the Remez exchange algorithm can be used to compute the optimal complex Chebyshev approximation. The algorithm converges to the optimal solution whenever the complex Chebyshev error alternates; in all other cases, the algorithm converges to the optimal Chebyshev approximation over a subset of the desired bands. The new algorithm is a generalization of the Parks-McClellan algorithm, so that arbitrary magnitude and phase responses can be approximated. Both causal and noncausal filters with complex or real-valued impulse responses can be designed. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.372870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.372870","startPage":"207","endPage":"216","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/8540/00372870.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8540","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complex Chebyshev approximation for FIR filter design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"Complex Chebyshev approximation for FIR filter design","publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4937837","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/372870/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complex Chebyshev approximation for FIR filter design","sourcePdf":"00372870.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050797S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8540","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"136","articleId":"372870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":372872,"authors":[{"name":"T.C.

The power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) is significantly constrained, more than any other performance parameter, by the exclusion of a complimentary active load. The PSRR for an inherently stable (single operating point) bandgap regulator built using only npn transistors is bounded below by 2.5 (nV/sub T//V/sub cc/)/sup n/=0.7 mV/V or 0.04 mV/V for circuits with n=2 or 3 stages, respectively. This represents a \"gain\" constraint imposed by the coincidence of signal and bias paths in bipolar circuits which employ current differencing or bootstrapping techniques. Base current errors can significantly degrade PSRR.

The method is based on closed-loop control of the line-to-line voltage vectors. It uses independent hysteresis comparator controllers to regulate the direct and quadrature axis components of the three phase output voltages. The controllers select the appropriate inverter output voltage vectors through an EPROM table. The closed-loop control allows a high performance over the whole range of operation, even when low speed devices such as the GTO are used. A neutral-point potential control is described, which is capable of stabilizing the variations within fixed limits during steady and transient states. The principle of the method is discussed and the vector selection technique is presented. The effectiveness in the output-voltage-waveform generation and the balance of the DC-link capacitor voltages are verified by simulation and experiment.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/373794/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-25 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852451","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An improved voltage vector control method for Neutral-Point-Clamped inverters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved voltage vector control method for Neutral-Point-Clamped inverters","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00373794.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041439S","chronDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1115","citationCount":"5","articleId":"373794","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":373804,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ryerson Polytechnic University, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"Bin Wu","id":"37545877500"},{"name":"F.

In this paper, the speed control system of the traveling-wave type ultrasonic motor is designed using adaptive control theory. Because the dynamic characteristics of the ultrasonic motor are unknown and vary with time, adaptive control theory which is useful for controlling the unknown plant is applied to design the adjustable speed control of USM. The mathematical motor model of USM is derived and motor parameters are identified by the recursively least square method.

The USM-actuated servo control system is schematically composed of the commercially-available travelling-wave type USM, mechanical loads, high-frequency DC-DC chopper regulator, two-phase high-frequency resonant inverter using parasitic piezo-electric load resonance parameters, pulse-encoder and its processing interface, and newly-developed fuzzy-reasoning software controller. The experimental breadboard is feasibly implemented and the software of the fuzzy-reasoning controller is designed for the specific USM characteristics and USM-related control loops. The experimental verifications are illustrated and their results are evaluated using a one-axis servo motion drive system from a practical point of view. It is proved that a new compact servo motion drive system using USM which incorporates the microprocessor-based two-input and one-output fuzzy-reasoning controller is cost-effective and more acceptable for certain direct drive applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1994.373845","startPage":"1269","endPage":"1274 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC'94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1994.373845","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8548","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1115/8548/00373845.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance and high precision ultrasonic motor-actuated positioning servo drive system using improved fuzzy-reasoning controller","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/373845/","displayDocTitle":"High performance and high precision ultrasonic motor-actuated positioning servo drive system using improved fuzzy-reasoning controller","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4852497","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance and high precision ultrasonic motor-actuated positioning servo drive system using improved fuzzy-reasoning controller","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00373845.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027699S","chronDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1115","citationCount":"19","articleId":"373845","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":373849,"authors":[{"name":"T.T.J.

Because the converters are rarely made to be identical, near-uniform current-sharing without additional control can be achieved only when converters connected in parallel have similar characteristics of being very close to the ideal current sources. This can occur at a cost of poor voltage regulation. As an alternative, the current-sharing control technique, which requires no remote-sensing, is proposed. The technique ensures uniform or designated current distribution throughout the specified load range. A control circuit module is independently implemented without any preliminary knowledge or any circuit modification of the source converters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/PESC.1994.373859","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC'94","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 Power Electronics Specialist Conference - PESC'94","pdfPath":"/iel2/1115/8548/00373859.pdf","startPage":"1342","endPage":"1351 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.1994.373859","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8548","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Investigation of the output droop characteristics of parallel-connnected DC-DC converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=373859","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/373859/","displayDocTitle":"Investigation of the output droop characteristics of parallel-connnected DC-DC converters","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4852508","conferenceDate":"20-25 June 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Investigation of the output droop characteristics of parallel-connnected DC-DC converters","confLoc":"Taipei, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"00373859.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028889S","chronDate":"20-25 Jun 1994","isNumber":"8548","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1115","citationCount":"49","articleId":"373859","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":373874,"authors":[{"name":"Hurng-Liahng Jou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Kaohsiung Institute of Technology, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hurng-Liahng Jou","id":"37275806600"},{"name":"Jinn-Chang Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Kao Yuan Junior College of Technology and Commerce, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Jinn-Chang Wu","id":"37279157900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1859-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"373874","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Uninterruptible power systems","Power system harmonics","Power harmonic filters","Voltage control","Reactive power","Active filters","Testing","Power supplies","Emergency power supplies"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uninterruptible power supplies","power system harmonics","reactive power control","compensation","electric current control","voltage control","harmonic distortion","load (electric)","power factor correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["UPS","parallel processing","harmonic suppression","reactive power compensation","active power line conditioner","back-up power","current-mode control","transient performance","output voltage","nonlinear load"]}],"abstract":"A new current-mode voltage-source parallel processing UPS is proposed in this paper.

The connectionist expert diagnosis system has similar profile to an expert system, but can be constructed much more easily from elemental samples. These samples associate the faults with their protective relays and breakers as well as the bus voltages and feeder currents. Through an elaborately designed structure, alarm signals are processed by different connectionist models. The output of the connectionist models is then integrated to provide fine final conclusion with a confidence level. The proposed approach has been practically verified by testing on a typical Taiwan Power (Taipower) secondary substation. The test results show that rapid and exactly correct diagnosis is obtained even for fault conditions involving multiple faults or failure operation of protective relays and circuit breakers. Moreover, the system can be transplanted into various substations with little additional implementation effort.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault diagnosis","Circuit faults","Circuit testing","Diagnostic expert systems","Power system protection","Substation protection","Power system relaying","Protective relaying","Power system modeling","Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","power system control","power system measurement","fault location","fault diagnosis","power system relaying","power system protection","circuit breakers","diagnostic expert systems","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power substation","online fault diagnosis","connectionist expert diagnosis system","protective relays","bus voltages","feeder currents","alarm signals","confidence level","multiple faults","circuit breakers"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8551","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.373914","startPage":"323","endPage":"331","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/8551/00373914.pdf","doi":"10.1109/59.373914","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line fault diagnosis of power substation using connectionist expert system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","displayDocTitle":"On-line fault diagnosis of power substation using connectionist expert system","accessionNumber":"4900395","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","volume":"10","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/373914/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line fault diagnosis of power substation using connectionist expert system","sourcePdf":"00373914.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043511S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"29","articleId":"373914","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":373915,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The concept of eigenvalue sensitivity is used here to formulate the linear first-order variation of the real part of the dominant system eigenvalue as a symbolic function of controller parameters. This eigenvalue variation is minimized iteratively subject to linear equality and inequality constraints. All controller parameters are tuned correctly when the objective function meets the desired performance criteria. In this method, no special assumptions are made on the type of power devices and linear feedback controllers present in the system. The proposed method is illustrated with three examples of a single-machine system with a power system stabilizer and a controller for a thyristor-controlled series capacitor.

The objective of this optimization problem is to minimize the system operation cost, which includes the fuel cost for generating the required electrical energy and starting up decommitted units, as well as the rotor depreciation during ramping processes, such as starting up, shutting down, loading, and unloading. According to the unit fatigue index curves provided by generator manufacturers, fixed unit ramping-rate limits, which have been used by previous studies, do not reflect the physical changes of generator rotors during the ramping processes due to the fatigue effect. By introducing ramping costs, the unit on/offstates can be determined more economically by the proposed method. The Lagrangian relaxation method is proposed for unit commitment and economic dispatch, in which the original problem is decomposed into several subproblems corresponding to the optimization process of individual units. The network model is employed to represent the dynamic process of searching for the optimal commitment and generation schedules of a unit over the entire study time span. The experimental results for a practical system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in optimizing the power system generation schedule.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.373928","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/8551/00373928.pdf","startPage":"60","endPage":"67","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.373928","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8551","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal generation scheduling with ramping costs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=373928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/373928/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal generation scheduling with ramping costs","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4908236","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal generation scheduling with ramping costs","sourcePdf":"00373928.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036536S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"70","articleId":"373928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":373934,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

Developments in real-time power system monitoring suggest that dynamic events can be monitored at the power system control centers, and naturally the energy function methods were tried as real-time stability prediction tools. However, a number of instances were uncovered, where the energy function methods which use the potential energy boundary surface as an approximation of the stability boundary produce unreliable results. In particular, during several transient stability studies, the boundary controlling unstable (BCU) equilibrium point method seemed to predict stable swings, whereas in reality the swings turned out to be unstable. This paper presents these counter-examples, and suggests an explanation as to why these methods produce a wrong result.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.373944","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/8551/00373944.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.373944","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8551","startPage":"210","endPage":"219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Clarifications of the BCU method for transient stability analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=373944","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Clarifications of the BCU method for transient stability analysis","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/373944/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4908253","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Clarifications of the BCU method for transient stability analysis","sourcePdf":"00373944.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.052768S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"47","articleId":"373944","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":373946,"authors":[{"name":"C.N.

One of the most promising uses of the PMU is for during-transient control applications. The work reported in this paper investigated the ability of synchronized phase angle measurements to identify impending instabilities through real time measurements, and to trigger remedial actions in time to prevent major power system outages. At question was feasibility and how many additional megawatts could be transferred when using the PMU to arm existing during-transient controllers. The partial energy function is defined and explained symbolically in terms of Kimbark's equal area criterion and power angle diagrams. The four steps for accomplishing PMU-based detection of instability are outlined. The approach is applied to instability conditions in Bonneville Power's 500 kV transmission network, USA. The effectiveness of the improved remedial action is demonstrated in terms of energy analysis and Kimbark diagrams and reported in terms of megawatts of increased power transfer.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/59.373953","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/59.373953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8551","startPage":"297","endPage":"306","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/59/8551/00373953.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=373953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Energy measurement","Power system transients","Transient analysis","Phasor measurement units","Power measurement","Power system measurements","Power system simulation","Power system stability","Power system analysis computing","Power system dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system stability","power system transients","power system security","power system control","power system measurement","phase measurement","electrical faults","transmission networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power system outages","phasor measurements","time-synchronized","partial energy analysis","large disturbances","stabilization","during-transient control","applications","real time measurements","feasibility","power transfer","phasor measurement unit","Kimbark diagrams","equal area criterion","power angle diagrams","instability","transmission network","remedial action","500 kV"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of phasor measurements and partial energy analysis in stabilizing large disturbances","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Feb. 1995","accessionNumber":"4908262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Feb.  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/373953/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of phasor measurements and partial energy analysis in stabilizing large disturbances","sourcePdf":"00373953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031901S","chronDate":"Feb.  1995","isNumber":"8551","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"62","articleId":"373953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":373964,"authors":[{"name":"R.A.

Value- and scope-related uncertainties can be addressed during the process of planning, but uncertainties in the operating environment require technical analysis within planning models. Flexibility and robustness are two key classes of strategies for managing the risk posed by these uncertainties. This paper reviews standard capacity expansion planning models and shows that they are poorly equipped to compare risk management strategies. Those that acknowledge uncertainty are better at evaluating robustness than flexibility, which implies a bias against flexible options.

Millimeter waves have good propagation properties in weather and give adequate spatial resolution when used to image the forward scene. Passive millimeter wave focal plane array cameras are new sensors which, integrated into future guidance and landing systems, promise to be an effective aid, or alternative, to existing technology for aircraft landings and take-offs under Cat III conditions.

The nodes in the input and output layers are evenly distributed to all processors: all nodes in the hidden layer(s) are replicated in each processor, and all weights are distributed to all processors corresponding to the nodes. We have implemented this algorithm on the CM-5 in the MIMD mode using the C programming language. For a case study of protein tertiary structure prediction, we obtained performance of 76 million weight updates per second (WUPS) with the machine partitioned for 512 processors without vector units. Experiments using different sized partitions indicated an almost linear relationship between the computation time and the number of processors, indicating good parallelization. We have also implemented the backpropagation algorithm on the Cray machines using the C programming language. The Cray-2 implementation yields performance of 10 million WUPS; the Cray X-MP EA implementation yields 18 million WUPS; and the Cray Y-MP M92 implementation yields 40 million WUPS.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374132","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8556/00374132.pdf","startPage":"22","endPage":"27 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Benchmarking of the CM-5 and the Cray machines with a very large backpropagation neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374132/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Benchmarking of the CM-5 and the Cray machines with a very large backpropagation neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4903688","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Benchmarking of the CM-5 and the Cray machines with a very large backpropagation neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035738S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374132","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374134,"authors":[{"name":"N.B.

The initial set of internal representations can be formed through an unsupervised learning process applied before the supervised training algorithm. The synaptic weights that connect the input of the network with the hidden units can be determined through various linear or nonlinear variations of a generalized Hebbian learning rule, known as the Oja's rule. Several experiments indicated that the use of the proposed initialization of the internal representations improves significantly the convergence of various gradient-descent-based algorithms used to perform nontrivial training tasks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374134","startPage":"32","endPage":"37 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8556/00374134.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerating the training of feedforward neural networks using generalized Hebbian rules for initializing the internal representations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Feedforward systems","Unsupervised learning","Multi-layer neural network","Hebbian theory","Convergence","Supervised learning","Data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","unsupervised learning","Hebbian learning","data compression"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural networks","generalized Hebbian rules","internal representations","complex training tasks","hidden units","data compression","data expansion layer","unsupervised learning","supervised training algorithm","synaptic weights","Oja's rule","convergence","gradient-descent-based algorithms","nontrivial training tasks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374134/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Accelerating the training of feedforward neural networks using generalized Hebbian rules for initializing the internal representations","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4903690","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerating the training of feedforward neural networks using generalized Hebbian rules for initializing the internal representations","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032149S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"1","articleId":"374134","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-25"},{"_id":374135,"authors":[{"name":"Xinghu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Xinghu Zhang","id":"37087959368"},{"name":"Chang-Chieh Hang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Chang-Chieh Hang","id":"37087150315"},{"name":"Shaohua Tan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Shaohua Tan","id":"37087158347"},{"name":"Pei-Zhuang Wang","lastName":"Pei-Zhuang Wang","id":"37087278414"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1901-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"374135","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=374135","abstract":"There have been a lot of works discussing (V, /spl and/)-neural network. However, because of the difficulty of mathematical analysis for (V, /spl and/)-functions, most previous works choose bounded-plus (+) and multiply (*) as the operations of V and /spl and/. The (V, /spl and/) neural network with operators (+, *) is much easier than the (V, /spl and/) neural network with some other operators, e.g. min-max operators, because it has little difference to a backpropagation neural network. In this paper, the authors choose min and max as the operation of V and /spl and/. Because of the difficulty of functions invoked with min and max operations, it is very difficult to deal with (V, /spl and/) neural networks with operators (min. max). In Section 1 of the paper, the authors first discuss the differentiations of (V, /spl and/)-functions, and get that \"if f/sub 1/(x), f/sub 2/(x), ..., f/sub n/(n) are continuously differentiable in real number line /spl Rfr/, then any function h(x) generated from f/sub 1/(x), f/sub 2/(x), ..., f/sub n/(X) through finite times of (V, /spl and/) operations is continuously differentiable almost everywhere in /spl Rfr/\". This statement guarantees that the delta rule given in Section 2 is rational and effective. In Section 3 the authors implement a simple example to show that the delta rule given in Section 2 is capable to train (V, /spl and/) neural networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374135","startPage":"38","endPage":"43 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8556/00374135.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374135","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The delta rule and learning for min-max neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["differentiation","neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delta rule","learning","min-max neural networks","min-max operators","backpropagation neural network","(V, /spl and/) neural networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374135/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"The delta rule and learning for min-max neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4903691","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The delta rule and learning for min-max neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374135.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374136,"authors":[{"name":"Mo-Yuen Chow","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA"],"lastName":"Mo-Yuen Chow","id":"37087160998"},{"name":"P.

Multilayer feedforward neural networks with GMDP units are shown to be capable of realizing higher-order neural networks.

The proposed method first partitions the whole complex training set into several manageable subsets and then generates small size networks to 'conquer' (or learn) all these training subsets. In order to achieve efficient partition on a train set, we have proposed an error correlation partitioning (ECP) scheme such that sub-training-sets are formed with small (acceptable) training error. Based on this learning strategy, a self-growing modular neural network system can be developed.

The intent of this paper is to use one such dynamic neural structure, namely the recurrent neural network, to drive unknown nonlinear systems to follow the desired trajectories. The learning scheme employed for this task consists of a conventional proportional-plus-derivative (PD) controller in the feedback loop and the recurrent neural network in the feedforward path. Once the convergence is achieved, the recurrent neural network approximates the inverse-dynamics model of the plant under control. The PD controller, on the other hand, guarantees the stability of the learning scheme. The effectiveness of this learning scheme is demonstrated through computer simulations and an experimental setup that demonstrates the balancing of a two-wheeled robot.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374158/","accessionNumber":"4903714","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Feedback-error learning scheme using recurrent neural networks for nonlinear dynamic systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feedback-error learning scheme using recurrent neural networks for nonlinear dynamic systems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374158.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026306S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"8","articleId":"374158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":374162,"authors":[{"name":"Tin-Yau Kwok","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Tin-Yau Kwok","id":"37087216447"},{"name":"Dit-Yan Yeung","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China"],"lastName":"Dit-Yan Yeung","id":"37087150848"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1901-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"374162","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":43},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Hilbert space","Feedforward neural networks","Chaos","Computer science","Councils","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","learning (artificial intelligence)","time series","chaos","optimisation","Hilbert spaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constructive neural networks","objective function","feedforward neural network","hidden unit functions","chaotic time series","learning","optimisation","Hilbert space"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=374162","abstract":"Based on a Hilbert space point of view, we proposed in our previous work a novel objective function for training new hidden units in a constructive feedforward neural network.

In this paper, we provide experimental support for the feasibility of using this objective function. Experiments are performed on two chaotic time series with encouraging results. In passing, we also demonstrate that engineering problems are not to be neglected in practical implementations.

The bottlenecks occur because all the existing learning techniques are based on a single large neural structure. In this paper, the authors approach the solution to this problem by analyzing the input vector space and, then, partition this space into subspaces. Each subspace will be learned by a small neural network with a simple learning rule. The authors also speed up the learning process by reducing the number of training vectors down to O(mn) instead of 2/sup n/, where m is the number of vectors having output targets equal to ones and n is the number of input bits. The reduction is based on the concept of guard ring vectors. The experimental results show that the learning can be speeded up by 2-30 times over the non-partition process.

For example, it has been proved (K. Hornik et al., 1989) that for every /spl epsiv/>0 an arbitrary continuous function on a compact set can be /spl epsiv/-approximated by a 3-layer neural network. This and other results prove that in principle, any function (e.g., any control) can be implemented by an appropriate neural network. But why neural networks? In addition to neural networks, an arbitrary continuous function can be also approximated by polynomials, etc. What is so special about neural networks that make them preferable approximators? To compare different approximators, one can compare the number of bits that we must store in order to be able to reconstruct a function with a given precision /spl epsiv/. For neural networks, we must store weights and thresholds. For polynomials, we must store coefficients, etc. We consider functions of one variable, and show that for some special neurons (corresponding to wavelets), neural networks are optimal approximators in the sense that they require (asymptotically) the smallest possible number of bits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374179/","accessionNumber":"4903735","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet neural networks are asymptotically optimal approximators for functions of one variable","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet neural networks are asymptotically optimal approximators for functions of one variable","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034809S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"22","articleId":"374179","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":374180,"authors":[{"name":"C.E.

It has been long claimed that neural networks are fault tolerant, i.e., they can continue to operate after sustaining partial damage. However, very little evidence shows that neural networks evolved from general learning algorithms really possess such merit. In this paper, the authors examine a learning method that intends to maximize the fault tolerance. The method is based on the well-known backpropagation learning algorithm. During the training, each neuron is given a small probability to have a simulated failure. This modification enforces that the computation be distributed to different computing elements in the network and thus maximizes the fault tolerance. Neurocontrollers developed using the new and conventional learning methods for pole balancing are compared.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374199/","accessionNumber":"4885579","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximizing fault tolerance in multilayer neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximizing fault tolerance in multilayer neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028038S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374201,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Most of these applications have used the backpropagation algorithm as the learning algorithm. One of the major problems with this algorithm is that its convergence time is usually very long since the training set must be presented many times to the network. The learning rate has to be selected very carefully. If the learning rate is too low, the network will take longer to converge. On the other hand, if the learning rate is too high, the network may be unstable and may never converge. Up to now, designers of neural network applications had to find an appropriate learning rate for their systems by trial and error. In this paper, a new method to compute dynamically the optimal learning rate is proposed. By using this method, a range of good static learning rates could be found. Furthermore, some studies have been done on factors influencing learning rates.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374214/","accessionNumber":"4890669","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Factors influencing the choice of a learning rate for a backpropagation neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Factors influencing the choice of a learning rate for a backpropagation neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.023603S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"5","articleId":"374214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374216,"authors":[{"name":"K.

Weight decay is an attractive tool for reducing oversized networks to appropriate-sized ones. However, researchers have reported contrasting results for the methodology in the past. This paper examines the effectiveness of the conventional weight decay methodology as it applies to classification problems. Training parameters, stability and the effectiveness of the methodology are discussed and analyzed. XOR and AND are used as examples to illustrate the authors' discussion. It is found that for these examples, weight decay can consistently minimize the number of hidden nodes used to learn the mappings with hyperbolic tangent activation functions. Ongoing tests with other binary mappings reveal that the methodology exhibits strong potential for use in more complex applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374233","startPage":"600","endPage":"605 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8556/00374233.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8556","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analysis of weight decay as a methodology of reducing three-layer feedforward artificial neural networks for classification problems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Neurons","Performance analysis","Computer networks","USA Councils","Feedforward neural networks","Application software","Stability analysis","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","transfer functions","learning (artificial intelligence)","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["weight decay","three-layer feedforward artificial neural networks","classification problems","training parameters","XOR","AND","hidden nodes","hyperbolic tangent activation functions","binary mappings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374233/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of weight decay as a methodology of reducing three-layer feedforward artificial neural networks for classification problems","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4890688","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of weight decay as a methodology of reducing three-layer feedforward artificial neural networks for classification problems","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051224S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8556","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"9","articleId":"374233","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374247,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-Lung Hung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Hai-Lung Hung","id":"37087362561"},{"name":"Wei-Chung Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Wei-Chung Lin","id":"37086968632"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1901-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"374247","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":29},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Biological neural networks","Training data","Network topology","Image segmentation","Supervised learning","Classification tree analysis","Computer architecture","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organising feature maps","fuzzy neural nets","network topology","learning (artificial intelligence)","tree data structures","search problems","image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic hierarchical self-organizing neural networks","self-organizing feature maps","dynamic trees","learning process","topology","fuzzy membership function","input data similarity","weight updating procedure","neurons allocation","search time","image segmentation"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=374247","abstract":"In this paper, we integrate the concept of self-organizing feature maps and the architecture of dynamic trees to develop dynamic hierarchical self-organizing neural networks.

A fuzzy membership function which measures the similarity of the input data is employed in the weight updating procedure and used as an criterion to allocate new neurons. Unlike the conventional self-organizing neural networks, the training samples are not input in sequence to update the weights. Instead, the weight updating procedure takes into account all the training data at one time. All these provide the proposed networks several advantages including revelation of hierarchical structure in data, dynamic allocation of neurons, short learning time, and short search time.

This new approach addresses problems in backpropagation and other gradient descent training algorithms. These problems include long training times, and the determination of the proper number of hidden nodes. We mitigate these difficulties by sequentially extracting important attributes of the training data in training each hidden node. The proposed algorithm separates the network training into the training of each layer of the network. The input layer is designed to partition the input data space using linear discriminant functions. The training starts from one hidden node. By applying a linear discriminant algorithm, a separable subset of the data is deleted from the training set. The remaining data is carried over to the training of the next hidden nodes. A hidden node is added to the network when it is needed because the classification performance on the training set is not yet good enough. Thus the training data set is reduced sequentially while the training is in progress. Each node of the output layer performs a logic function of the binary outputs of the hidden nodes. The training algorithm for the output layer is same as Boolean minimization.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374263","startPage":"708","endPage":"713 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374263","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8557","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8557/00374263.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesizing neural networks by sequential addition of hidden nodes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374263/","displayDocTitle":"Synthesizing neural networks by sequential addition of hidden nodes","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4911716","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesizing neural networks by sequential addition of hidden nodes","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374263.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036124S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"5","articleId":"374263","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374275,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The algorithm adds new RBFs at the places having the largest errors, and prunes neurons that have insignificant contribution. With the adding and pruning capability, it is expected that developing RBFNs for high-dimensional problems will become more feasible.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374280/","accessionNumber":"4911733","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A learning algorithm for radial basis function networks: with the capability of adding and pruning neurons","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A learning algorithm for radial basis function networks: with the capability of adding and pruning neurons","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02672S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"6","articleId":"374280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374284,"authors":[{"name":"O.T.-C.

Since the sigmoidal transformation can be approximated piecewise linearly, the correlations among the weighted sums decrease under the sigmoidal transformations.

The networks considered are the backpropagation trained network (BPN), the general regression neural network (GRNN), the class-sensitive neural network (CSNN), and the conjugate gradient trained network (CGNN). It is concluded that CSNN is among the best performing networks in both prediction and trend estimation. All major indicators are evaluated by the neural networks. It is found that the use of good indicators like the rate of change, momentum, moving average, etc. can lead to about 5% improvement over the case that no indicator is used. Momentum computed from the previous 14 day data is the best single indicator. The complexity of the financial market probably explains why the large number of indicators cannot provide any significant improvement in network classification.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374354","startPage":"1199","endPage":"1202 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374354","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8557","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8557/00374354.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks for financial market prediction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374354/","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks for financial market prediction","isConference":true,"volume":"2","accessionNumber":"4905335","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks for financial market prediction","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045134S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8557","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"18","articleId":"374354","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":374355,"authors":[{"name":"D.F.

In this paper, the authors propose a novel learning approach, self-organizing and self-adjusting fuzzy modeling (SOSAFM), for inference rules. Basically, the proposed system consists of two stages, the self-organizing stage (SOS) and the self-adjusting stage (SAS). In the first stage, the input data is divided into several groups by applying Kohonen's feature maps. Gaussian distribution functions are employed as the standard form of the membership functions. Methods of statistics are used to determine the center and width of the membership function for each group. Regarding the consequences, the linear regression method is used. After the above procedures, one can decide the initial parameters of fuzzy systems. Then, the error backpropagation-type learning method is used to fine-tune the parameters. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is better than conventional neural networks in both accuracy and speed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374382","startPage":"1532","endPage":"1536 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374382","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8558/00374382.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network driven fuzzy inference system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374382/","displayDocTitle":"Neural network driven fuzzy inference system","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"4905354","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network driven fuzzy inference system","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374382.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065013S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"3","articleId":"374382","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374383,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The fuzzy inference can be applied to various problems. However, the determination of the membership functions is a difficult problem because the determination depends on human experts. The auto-tuning methods of the fuzzy model have been proposed to develop the time-consuming operation used by human experts. The problem is that a number of the fuzzy rules in the multiple input and multiple output is needed in the case of simple fuzzy inference. Therefore, the authors propose an auto-tuning method of hierarchical fuzzy inference. The proposed method enables the fuzzy model to construct the optimal and the minimal structures.

In particular, it enhances the fuzzy controller with self-learning capability for achieving the prescribed control objective into near optimal manner. The methodology first adopts expert experiences, it then uses the GA to find the fuzzy controller's optimal set of parameters. In using GA, we must define an objective function to measure the performance of the controller. Since the behaviour of the dynamic system is hard to predict, a three-layer forward network has been adopted. For the purpose to accelerate the learning process, a conventional simplex optimal algorithm is used to reduce the search space. Finally, an example is given to show the potential of the method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374400","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8558/00374400.pdf","startPage":"1632","endPage":"1637 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning and tuning fuzzy logic controllers through genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Learning and tuning fuzzy logic controllers through genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"volume":"3","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4905372","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning and tuning fuzzy logic controllers through genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059802S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374407,"authors":[{"name":"Jian-Nan Lin","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Jian-Nan Lin","id":"37087461623"},{"name":"Shin-Min Song","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Illinois, Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Shin-Min Song","id":"37087253488"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1901-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"374407","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":32},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=374407","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Control systems","Neural networks","Neurons","Multi-layer neural network","Uncertain systems","Inverse problems","Kinematics","Feedforward neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["large-scale systems","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural network","complex system control","complex uncertain systems","nonlinearities","three layer structure","rule-base connection structure","inverse kinematics","feedforward multilayer neural networks"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374407","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8558/00374407.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1673 vol.3","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374407","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel fuzzy neural network for the control of complex systems","abstract":"Various fuzzy neural networks (FNNs) were proposed to enhance the performance of neural networks (NNs) for complex, uncertain systems with highly nonlinearities. In this paper, we propose a novel FNN with the following features: a simple structure of three layers with different types of fuzzy neurons; a straightforward method for generating suitable FNN rule base connection structure; a simple learning algorithm and a method for obtaining a good guess of the initial weights of the proposed FNN. The design of the fuzzy neurons and network structure of this FNN are presented. This FNN is then evaluated by a simulation study of inverse kinematics of a two degrees of freedom manipulator. It is shown that the proposed FNN outperforms conventional feedforward multilayer neural networks and is simpler than existing FNN proposed by Lin and Lee (1991).

Each neuron of the hidden layer is assigned a fuzzy proposition which composes a fuzzy rule. The network is learned structurally with generation/annihilation of neurons. After the rules learning process, one may extract simple fuzzy production rules from the network. Next, the authors extend the method to the cases of multi-dimensional rules.

Accordingly, it consists of two stages: 1) clustering neural network (CNN) stage, and 2) output neural network (ONN) stage. CNN categorizes input sample into an appropriate cluster, which is identical to finding a relevant rule to be fired in knowledge base. Then in the ONN stage, ONNs are built based on information about the clusters derived from CNN stage, and used to make a final decision: \"bankrupt\" or \"non-bankrupt\". CNN uses two types of unsupervised neural network models for pattern clustering, the self-organizing map and learning vector quantization, and then learns the clusters in a supervised manner. ONN utilizes a supervised neural network.

Pixel smartness is achieved by exploiting the cellular neural network paradigm, incorporating at each Spixel an analog computing cell which interacts with those of nearby Spixels. The authors propose a current-mode technique for CNN-Spixel chips and give measurements from two 16/spl times/16 prototypes in a single-poly double-metal CMOS n-well 1.6 /spl mu/m technology. One of these prototypes is designed for the application of connected component detection (CCDet), and the other to calculate the radon transform (RT) of an input image. The CCDet chip obtains a density of /spl sim/89 Spixels (sensory+regulation+processing) per mm/sup 2/, with a power consumption of 105 /spl mu/W per Spixel. The sensory+regulation circuitry amount to /spl sim/30% of the total Spixel pixel area and the rest corresponds to the processing circuitry. Area and power figures for the RT chip are similar. These area and power figures, and the fact that connections among pixels are made by abutment (requiring no extra routing area) enable forecasting single-die CMOS chips with 100/spl times/100 complexity and about 1 W power consumption.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374444/","accessionNumber":"4917278","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cellular neural network chips with optical image acquisition","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cellular neural network chips with optical image acquisition","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062109S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","articleId":"374444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":374446,"authors":[{"name":"E. van Keulen","affiliation":["University of Technology, Eindhoven, Netherlands"],"firstName":"E.","lastName":"van Keulen","id":"38230423300"},{"name":"S.

Therefore hardware implementation becomes indispensable. The problem is then to choose the right chip that is to be used for a particular application. For this, a proper set of hardware performance criteria is needed to be able to compare the performance of neural network chips. The most important criterium is related to the speed a network processes information with a given accuracy. For this a new criterium is proposed. The 'effective number of connection bits' represents the effective accuracy of a chip. The '(effective) connection primitives per second' criterium now provides a new speed criterium normalized to the amount of information value that is processed in a connection. In addition to this the authors also propose another new criterium called 'reconfigurability number' as a measure for the reconfigurability and size of a chip. Using these criteria gives a much more neutral view of the performance of a neural network chip than the existing conventional criteria, such as 'connections per second'.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374446","startPage":"1885","endPage":"1888 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8558/00374446.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network hardware performance criteria","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural network hardware","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Computer architecture","Computer networks","Fault tolerance","Fabrication","Integrated circuit technology","Embedded system","Integrated circuit manufacture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural chips","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network hardware performance criteria","neural network chips","effective number of connection bits","effective accuracy","connection primitives per second","reconfigurability number"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374446/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural network hardware performance criteria","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4917280","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network hardware performance criteria","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374446.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059048S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"3","articleId":"374446","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":374449,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Moreover, several alternatives for the integration of a solid-state image sensor that are compatible with a standard CMOS process have been published. The different possible input/output structures are evaluated towards their compatibility with both techniques.

Problems become more complex, it is increasingly difficult to find a suitable encoding of constraints into an energy function, which will effectively guide the network to a desired solution. In previous work by Gassen and Carothers (1993), a difficult scheduling problem in VLSI design was encoded into a Hopfield-type neural network.

The neuron soma circuits use a novel, highly accurate CMOS circuit strategy to realize piecewise-linear characteristics in current-mode domain. Their prototypes obtain reduced area and low voltage power supply (down to 3 V) with clock frequency of 500 kHz. As regard to the synapse circuit, it obtains large linearity and continuous, linear, weight adjustment by exploitation of the exponential-law operation of CMOS-BJTs.

We assume that the cascade-correlation (CAS) training algorithm is used to train the weights of the ANNs concerned. Under a given time constraint that is long enough to train tens of ANNs completely, we divide the time into quanta, and present a method for scheduling dynamically the ANN to be trained in each quantum from a pool of partially trained ANNs. Our goal is to find an ANN configuration with smaller number of hidden units as compared to the alternative of applying the CAS algorithm repeatedly to train each ANN to completion before exploring new ANNs. Our system is a population-based generate-and-test method that maintains a population of candidate ANNs, and that selectively train those that are predicted to require smaller configurations. Since it is difficult to predict the exact number of hidden units required when the CAS algorithm terminates, our system compares two partially trained ANNs and predicts which one will converge with a smaller number of hidden units relative to the other. Our prediction mechanism is based on a comparator neural network (CANN) that takes as inputs the TSSE-versus-time behavior of training performed already on two ANNs, and that predicts which one will require a smaller number of hidden units when convergence is reached. We show that our CANN can predict correctly most of the time, and present experimental results on better configurations found in a given time limit for a classification problem and the two-spiral problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374471/","accessionNumber":"4939890","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An automated design system for finding the minimal configuration of a feed-forward neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An automated design system for finding the minimal configuration of a feed-forward neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374471.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048581S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"5","articleId":"374471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374472,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The new addition to this traditional \"divide-and-conquer\" structure is a voting layer above the outputs of the modules. In this layer, the modules cooperate in deciding the final decision by training every module on some additional classes: each class represents a group of classes of another module. During testing, the average \"vote\" of the modules for each other is calculated and multiplied by the classes output. This scheme gave higher accuracy and faster learning speed than the backpropagation scheme.

MSL algorithm starts with a single SM, then does the following three phases repeatedly until all the training samples are successfully learned: 1) the learning phase in which the training samples are learned by the current SM; 2) the sieving phase in which the training samples that have been successfully learned are sifted out from the training set; and 3) the growing phase in which the current SM is frozen and a new SM is added in order to learn the remaining training samples.

The association performance of a cross-coupled Hopfield net with many-to-many mapping internetworks (CCHN-MMMI), which is an extended version of CCHN is investigated through computer simulations. The simulation results show that the performance of CCHN-MMMI is greatly improved as compared with that of a conventional Hopfield network (HN) as long as M is not too large. However, in our simulation, the performance of CCHN-MMMI with M/spl ges/16 is worse than or equal to that of HN. In order to clarify the factors on its performance deterioration, the features-of average activities in modules and interactions are separately investigated. As a result, we clarify three factors on the deterioration and suggest some approaches to solve them.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374479/","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4939898","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"The estimation of cross-coupled Hopfield nets as an interactive modular neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The estimation of cross-coupled Hopfield nets as an interactive modular neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05918S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","articleId":"374479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":374482,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The complexity of the growing network is adapted automatically according to the complexity of the task. The algorithm generates a feedforward network bottom up by cyclically inserting cascaded hidden layers. Inputs of a hidden layer unit are locally restricted with respect to the input space by using a new kind of activation function. Contrary to the cascade-correlation learning architecture, we introduce different correlation measures to train the network units featuring different goals. The task decomposition between subnetworks is done by maximizing the anticorrelation between the hidden layer units output and a connection routing algorithm between the hidden layers. These features resembles the TACOMA (task decomposition, correlation measures and local attention neurons) learning architecture. Results are shown for two difficult to solve problems in comparison to those produced by the CASCOR algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374482","startPage":"1355","endPage":"1358 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8558/00374482.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Growing artifical neural networks based on correlation measures, task decomposition and local attention neurons","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Routing","Feeds","Data engineering","Design engineering","Algorithm design and analysis","Evolutionary computation","Artificial neural networks","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","computational complexity","learning (artificial intelligence)","correlation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["growing neural networks","correlation measures","task decomposition","local attention neurons","learning architecture","complexity","feedforward network","cascaded hidden layers","activation function","connection routing algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Growing artifical neural networks based on correlation measures, task decomposition and local attention neurons","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4939901","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Growing artifical neural networks based on correlation measures, task decomposition and local attention neurons","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048041S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"3","articleId":"374482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374489,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The simplest wavelet neural network exhibits much higher ability of generalization and much shorter time for learning rather than a three-layered feedforward neural network. Furthermore the wavelet neural network is guaranteed to give the global minimum. Other three wavelet neural networks are examined for predicting chaotic behaviour of a nonlinear dynamical system.

In the incremental communication, instead of communicating the full magnitude of an input (output) variable of a neuron, only the increment/decrement to the previous value of the variable, using reduced precision, is sent on a communication link. In this paper, a variable precision incremental communication scheme is proposed. Variable precision, which can be implemented in either hardware or software, can further reduce the complexity of intercommunication and speed up the computations in massively parallel computers. This scheme is applied to the multilayer feedforward networks and simulation studies are carried out. The results of our simulations reveal that, regardless of the degree of the complexity of the problems used, variable precision scheme has stable convergence behavior and shows considerable degree of saving in terms of the number of bits used for communications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374492","startPage":"1409","endPage":"1414 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8558/00374492.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training artificial neural networks using variable precision incremental communication","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Costs","Neurons","Concurrent computing","Nonhomogeneous media","Computational modeling","Computer science","Hardware","Convergence","Fixed-point arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["learning (artificial intelligence)","feedforward neural nets","multilayer perceptrons"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network training","variable precision incremental communication","incremental inter-node communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374492/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Training artificial neural networks using variable precision incremental communication","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4939911","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Training artificial neural networks using variable precision incremental communication","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374492.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029992S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":374495,"authors":[{"name":"Joonsuk Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Joonsuk Kim","id":"37087181266"},{"name":"J.H.

(1990) extended the traditional multi-layer perceptron to allow activation, threshold and weight values to take on complex values instead of real values. Although at first sight this might seem biologically unmotivated, if phase as well as frequency information in synaptic pulse trains plays a part in processing in the brain, then complex valued networks could be used to model phase information, in the same way as complex numbers are used to model phase in electrical engineering. Clifford algebras offer a higher dimensional generalization of the complex numbers. The present authors have shown that it is possible to derive a back error propagation algorithm for networks with Clifford valued weight and activation values. This work ceases to be biologically motivated, but it is hoped that by bringing together multidimensional signals into single elements of a Clifford algebra, that more compact representations of the pattern space will be obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374502","startPage":"1465","endPage":"1469 vol.3","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8558/00374502.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374502","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks in the Clifford domain","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent networks","Algebra","Frequency","Biological neural networks","Biological system modeling","Brain modeling","Electrical engineering","Multidimensional systems","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptrons","algebra","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","multi-layer perceptron","synaptic pulse trains","phase information","Clifford algebras","complex numbers","back error propagation algorithm","activation values","multidimensional signals","pattern space"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374502/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks in the Clifford domain","isConference":true,"volume":"3","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4939921","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks in the Clifford domain","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041564S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"24","articleId":"374502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":374503,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Typically, one of the trained NNs is chosen as best, while the rest are discarded. Hashem and Schmeiser (1992) propose using optimal linear combinations of a number of trained neural networks instead of using a single best network. In this paper, we discuss and extend the idea of optimal linear combinations of neural networks. Optimal linear combinations are constructed by forming weighted sums of the corresponding outputs of the networks. The combination-weights are selected to minimize the mean squared error with respect to the distribution of random inputs. Combining the trained networks may help integrate the knowledge acquired by the component networks and thus improve model accuracy. We investigate some issues concerning the estimation of the optimal combination-weights and the role of the optimal linear combination in improving model accuracy for both well-trained and poorly trained component networks. Experimental results based on simulated data are included. For our examples, the model accuracy resulting from using estimated optimal linear combinations is better than that of the best trained network and that of the simple averaging of the outputs of the component networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374511","startPage":"1507","endPage":"1512 vol.3","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374511","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8558","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8558/00374511.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal linear combinations of neural networks: an overview","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374511/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal linear combinations of neural networks: an overview","isConference":true,"volume":"3","accessionNumber":"4939930","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal linear combinations of neural networks: an overview","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374511.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041032S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8558","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"30","articleId":"374511","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":374512,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The technique is applied to recover a self-organized network when some faulty links and/or neurons occur during the operation. If some input links of a specific neuron are detected faulty, their weights will be shifted to healthy links of the same neuron. On the other hand, if a faulty neuron is encountered, then we can treat it as a special case of faulty links by considering all the output links of that neuron to be faulty.

This paper centers on situations where two conditions are present; first, that the neural network is implemented using limited precision hardware, and second, that the weights were calculated using higher precision values than can be stored in the hardware. This paper shows that limited precision weights in the target system can result in forward calculation errors that are sufficiently large to cause classification mistakes in an example problem. The cause of classification mistakes is identified in terms of topological features in weight-space. A numerical calculation, that demonstrates the existence of weight-space regions where such errors occur, is presented. The Big Valley Search algorithm is proposed to overcome the effects of limited storage. Experimental results are presented to show that the Big Valley Search algorithm can be used to overcome implementation problems encountered when implementing a fault classifier using an analog neural network chip. Using experimental results, the requirement for chip-in-loop (CIL) programming of analog chips is shown to be unnecessary.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374524","startPage":"2022","endPage":"2027 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8559/00374524.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new training method for precision-limited analog neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374524/","displayDocTitle":"A new training method for precision-limited analog neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"4911744","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new training method for precision-limited analog neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054692S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","articleId":"374524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374526,"authors":[{"name":"R.S.

This architecture has been designed and implemented on Xilinx XC3090 FPGAs, and its performance has been measured.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374538","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8559/00374538.pdf","startPage":"2097","endPage":"2102 vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374538","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RRANN: a hardware implementation of the backpropagation algorithm using reconfigurable FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374538/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"RRANN: a hardware implementation of the backpropagation algorithm using reconfigurable FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4917304","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RRANN: a hardware implementation of the backpropagation algorithm using reconfigurable FPGAs","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038851S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"23","articleId":"374538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":374543,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Is a backpropagation neural network more accurate at predicting survival in breast cancer than the current staging system? For over thirty years cancer outcome prediction has been based on the pTNM staging system. There are two problems with this system: (1) it is not very accurate, and (2) its accuracy can not be improved because predictive variables can not be added to the model without increasing the model's complexity to the point where it is no longer useful to the clinician. Using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic, the authors compare the accuracy of the following predictive models: pTNM stage, principal components analysis, classification and regression trees, logistic regression, cascade correlation neural network, conjugate gradient descent neural network, backpropagation neural network, and probabilistic neural network. Using just the TNM variables both the backpropagation neural network, AUC.768, and the probabilistic neural network, AUC.759, are significantly more accurate than the pTNM stage system, AUC.720 (all SEs<.01, p<.01 for both models compared to the pTNM model). Adding variables further increases the prediction accuracy of the backpropagation neural network, AUC.779, and the probabilistic neural network, AUC.777. Adding the new prognostic factors p53 and HER-2/neu increases the backpropagation neural network's accuracy to an AUC of .850. The neural networks perform equally well when applied to another breast cancer data set and to a colorectal cancer data set. Neural networks are able to significantly improve breast cancer outcome prediction accuracy when compared to the TNM stage system. They can combine prognostic factors to further improve accuracy. Neural networks are robust across data bases and cancer sites. Neural networks can perform as well as the best traditional prediction methods, and they can capture the power of nonmonotonic predictors and discover complex genetic interactions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374560","startPage":"2213","endPage":"2216 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8559/00374560.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing artificial neural networks to other statistical methods for medical outcome prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Statistical analysis","Neural networks","Backpropagation","Breast cancer","Predictive models","Regression tree analysis","Accuracy","Medical treatment","Clinical trials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical computing","neural nets","statistical analysis","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural networks","statistical methods","medical outcome prediction","survival prediction","therapy","clinical trials","patient information","backpropagation neural network","staging system","breast cancer","area under the curve","receiver operating characteristic","pTNM stage","principal components analysis","classification","regression trees","logistic regression","cascade correlation neural network","conjugate gradient descent neural network","probabilistic neural network","prognostic factors","colorectal cancer"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Comparing artificial neural networks to other statistical methods for medical outcome prediction","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4911777","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing artificial neural networks to other statistical methods for medical outcome prediction","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374560.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050074S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"10","articleId":"374560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":374561,"authors":[{"name":"D.A.

Since then, several researchers have proven that multilayer ANNs, with an arbitrary squashing function in the hidden layer, can approximate any multivariate function to any degree of accuracy. Based on these results, researchers have attempted to train backpropagation networks to realize arbitrary functions. Although their results are encouraging, this technique has many shortcomings and may lead to an inappropriate response by the network. In this paper, the authors present an alternative neural network architecture, based on cascaded univariate function approximators, which can be trained to multiply two real numbers and may be used to realize arbitrary multivariate function mappings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374561","startPage":"2217","endPage":"2222 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8559/00374561.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374561","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural networks as function approximators: teaching a neural network to multiply","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Education","Function approximation","Backpropagation","Artificial neural networks","Network topology","Aerospace electronics","Multi-layer neural network","Shape","Error correction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","backpropagation","neural net architecture","function approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","multivariate function approximators","Kolmogorov's theorem","squashing function","hidden layer","backpropagation networks","cascaded univariate function approximators","multivariate function mappings"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374561/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural networks as function approximators: teaching a neural network to multiply","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4911778","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural networks as function approximators: teaching a neural network to multiply","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374561.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025464S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374561","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374568,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Motion perceived by humans when succeeding frames are presented is called 'apparent motion'. According to its psychophysical characteristics, a categorization of apparent motion into two parts has been proposed, i.e. the short-range apparent motion (SRAM) and the long-range one (LRAM). From a computational viewpoint, SRAM and LRAM are characterized by filtering and matching tasks, respectively. In this paper, a neural network model of LRAM is proposed. The model uses a neural network of the Hopfield type which solves the matching task as an optimization problem. Computer simulation shows that the network yields a satisfactory solution of the matching task with careful consideration of the energy function. Also, it is shown that the number of iterations required in the computation is in a plausible range for a model of human visual processing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374568","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8559/00374568.pdf","startPage":"2254","endPage":"2257 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network model of long-range apparent motion in the human vision","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374568/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"A neural network model of long-range apparent motion in the human vision","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4911785","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network model of long-range apparent motion in the human vision","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.028S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"1","articleId":"374568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374585,"authors":[{"name":"D.G.

The class of plants considered constitutes a set of unknown but invertible nonlinear systems. In this method, neural network outputs are treated as parametric uncertainty and are combined with other plant uncertainties so that a robust controller can be designed. An algorithm for confining the network's output to be less than a given bound is presented. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using a linear inner loop feedback to reduce the size of a neural network for robust control purposes.

By its nature, extended Kalman filter (EKF) training is realized with instance-by-instance updates, rather than by performing updates at the end of a batch of training instances or patterns. Motivated originally by the desire to be able to base an update an a collection of instances, rather than just one, we recognized that the simple construct of multiple streams of training examples allows a batch-like update to be performed without violating an underlying principle of Kalman training, vis. that the approximate error covariance matrix remain consistent with the updates that have actually been performed.

An efficient controller not only requires a precise knowledge of source characteristics to achieve admission control but it should also anticipate new connection impact on the network state to ensure optimal performance. Therefore, we first address the problem of modelling each queueing system in the network with three random neurons representing respectively the average number of waiting cells, the queue utilization factor and the traffic burstiness, and show how the connection scheme and the weight initialization benefit from the stationary queueing theory results. Then, we model the overall network with several sub-RNNs located on the switching facilities and virtually connected via the real communication links. The method's efficiency is illustrated by an experiment in which the neural networks achieve call admission control on the basis of user requested service quality. This simple controller is shown to maximize the system throughput while maintaining quality of service.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374610/","accessionNumber":"4917308","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Call admission control in ATM networks with the random neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Call admission control in ATM networks with the random neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.025915S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374611,"authors":[{"name":"G.V.

A previous result in robust control is expanded upon for use in this procedure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374617","startPage":"2524","endPage":"2529 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374617","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8559/00374617.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust control of nonlinear systems using norm-bounded neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374617/","displayDocTitle":"Robust control of nonlinear systems using norm-bounded neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"4917315","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust control of nonlinear systems using norm-bounded neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374617.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027343S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"7","articleId":"374617","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374618,"authors":[{"name":"Ren Xue Mei","affiliation":["The Seventh Research Division, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, China"],"lastName":"Ren Xue Mei","id":"37086988317"},{"name":"Gao Wei Bing","affiliation":["The Seventh Research Division, Beijing Aeronautics and Astronautics University, China"],"lastName":"Gao Wei Bing","id":"37087594218"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1901-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"374618","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":10},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=374618","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Nonlinear systems","Convergence","Robust control","Servomechanisms","Robust stability","Control system synthesis","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["tracking","nonlinear control systems","neurocontrollers","convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network controller","nonlinear systems","robust asymptotic set-point tracking","convergence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374618","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8559/00374618.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","startPage":"2530","endPage":"254a vol.4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374618","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network control for nonlinear systems","abstract":"A neural network controller is constructed for robust asymptotic set-point tracking in a class of nonlinear systems.

The decentralized control architecture is composed of local neuro-controllers, local neuro-identifiers and an overall interaction neuro-identifier. With the interaction neuro-identifier that catches interaction characteristics, a local neuro-identifier is trained to simulate a subsystem dynamics. A local neuro-controller is trained to learn how to control the subsystem by using a generalized backpropagation through time training algorithm.

One way to determine the reliability of the neuro-control technique is to test it on a variety of realistic problems. Another way is to compare it directly with existing traditional control techniques, to see whether it works well and where it needs further refinement. In this article, we compare the neuro-control algorithm to three other control algorithms: fuzzy logic control, generalised predictive control, and proportional-plus-integral (PI) control. Each of these four algorithms is implemented on a water bath temperature control system. The four systems are compared through experimental studies under identical conditions with respect to set-point regulation, the effect of unknown load disturbances, large parameter variation, and variable deadtime in the system. It is found that the neuro-control system compares well with the other three control systems and offers encouraging advantages. However, from the results of the experimental studies, the best characteristics of each of these different classes of control systems may be combined for realising a more efficient and intelligent control scheme.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374631","startPage":"2599","endPage":"2604 vol.4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374631","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8559/00374631.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Temperature regulation with neural networks and alternative control schemes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374631/","displayDocTitle":"Temperature regulation with neural networks and alternative control schemes","isConference":true,"volume":"4","accessionNumber":"4917329","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temperature regulation with neural networks and alternative control schemes","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040829S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"1","articleId":"374631","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":374634,"authors":[{"name":"M.K.

The controller design is novel and ensures a satisfactory suppression of the tip vibrations while facilitating a rapid hub rotation for executing motions during which payload variations can occur.

This paper introduces the a new concept for autotuning sigmoid function shapes of neural network servo controllers. Three types of tuning method are proposed in order to improve the nonlinear mapping capability. The first type uses a uniform sigmoid function shape. With the second type, the sigmoid function shapes within one layer are the same and the shapes are tuned layer by layer is tuned. With the third type, the sigmoid function shape of each neuron is different and is tuned individually.

The neural network can be used to learn a sequence of mappings or space transformations. A 2-d.o.f. robot arm can be controlled to follow a sequence of steps from an initial position to a desired final position. The learning of a target position is understood as a dynamic control learning versus static learning. In this experiment the neural network is taught to guide robot arms from various initial points surrounding one arbitrarily chosen target point. The learning trajectories are straight lines on which the end effector moves. The closer the end effector is to the final point, the smaller angle increments are generated. The neural network is trained in such a way that these increments should approach the values close to zero in a finite number of steps. When this occurs, the implemented (computed) final position of a robot arm end effector should be as close as possible to the true final position. After training is finished, the feedback is added to the neural network and output signal increments are added to the input values. The neural network can generalize very well and lead the end effector to its final position from any initial position (different than those used for training) within the end effector's working envelope.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374637","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8559/00374637.pdf","startPage":"2633","endPage":"2638 vol.4","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8559","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"End effector target position learning using feedforward with error back-propagation and recurrent neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374637/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"End effector target position learning using feedforward with error back-propagation and recurrent neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4917335","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"End effector target position learning using feedforward with error back-propagation and recurrent neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374637.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03068S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8559","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374637","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374650,"authors":[{"name":"K.C.

The mobile robot to be controlled is organized in a tricycle structure. Movement is performed by selection of angular velocities for the motors attached to the two propulsive wheels. Following an initial learning phase, the controller architecture allows movement between arbitrary points through exteroceptive or visual information. It is important to note that rather than learning explicit trajectories, the controller learns the relationship between angular velocities and the magnitude and direction of the resulting movement. This approach solves the inverse kinematic problem, so that visual information in spatial coordinates can generate the appropriate wheel angular velocities to move the mobile robot to a desired goal. The main characteristic of this architecture that distinguishes it from other neural controllers is that it does not require supervision during the training phase.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374683","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374683.pdf","startPage":"2848","endPage":"2853 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A real-time unsupervised neural network for the control of a mobile robot","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374683/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"A real-time unsupervised neural network for the control of a mobile robot","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4917373","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A real-time unsupervised neural network for the control of a mobile robot","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374683.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042074S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","articleId":"374683","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":374684,"authors":[{"name":"Gang Feng","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Kensington, NSW, Australia"],"lastName":"Gang Feng","id":"37087152770"},{"name":"C.K.

This method exploits the discrimination capability of neural network classifier while using HMM formalism to capture the dynamics of input patterns.

The authors' claim is that, for at least some classes of images, this method is provided by the fractal reconstruction of the image. The authors present a set of experiments, aimed at investigating the previous claim. As images the authors have selected m=9 classes of trees. Each prototype has been generated with a single fractal rule, which, starting from a base shape, appends to the growing figure smaller and smaller copies of itself.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374702","startPage":"2952","endPage":"2955 vol.5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374702.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using fractals to learn image descriptions by means of artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374702/","displayDocTitle":"Using fractals to learn image descriptions by means of artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"5","accessionNumber":"4917390","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using fractals to learn image descriptions by means of artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026555S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","articleId":"374702","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374703,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The landmarks of the model are matched against those of the scene using a continuous Hopfield neural network in which feature matching is formulated as the optimization of a cost function. The sphericity of the triangular transformation, which is invariant with respect to translation, rotation, and scaling, is used as a similarity measure in the feature matching module. The matched landmarks resulting from the feature matching module are introduced to the decision making module which evaluates the overall goodness of the match and identifies the location of the object in the scene.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374703","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374703.pdf","startPage":"2956","endPage":"2961 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374703","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An analog-Hopfield neural network for recognition of partially visible 2-D objects","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374703/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"An analog-Hopfield neural network for recognition of partially visible 2-D objects","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4917391","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analog-Hopfield neural network for recognition of partially visible 2-D objects","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374703.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070762S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","articleId":"374703","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":374704,"authors":[{"name":"T.

A rule of thumb for selecting activation functions or their combination is proposed. The sigmoid, Gaussian and sinusoidal functions are selected due to their independent and fundamental space division properties. The sigmoid function is not effective for a single hidden unit. On the contrary, the other functions can provide good performance. When several hidden units are employed, the sigmoid function is useful. However, the convergence speed is still slower than the others. The Gaussian function is sensitive to the additive noise, while the others are rather insensitive. As a result, based on convergence rates, the minimum error and noise sensitivity, the sinusoidal function is most useful for both with and without additive noise. The property of each function is discussed based on the internal representation, that is the distribution of the hidden unit inputs and outputs. Although this selection depends on the input signals to be classified, the periodic function can be effectively applied to a wide range of application fields.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374710","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374710.pdf","startPage":"2997","endPage":"3002 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of activation functions in multilayer neural network for pattern classification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374710/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of activation functions in multilayer neural network for pattern classification","isConference":true,"volume":"5","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4917398","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of activation functions in multilayer neural network for pattern classification","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374710.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072996S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"14","articleId":"374710","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":374715,"authors":[{"name":"B.B.

For each representation, the learning vector quantization network is first used to establish a transformation to an associated feature space. A recurrent network is then used to fuse the information generated by each of the representations. The weights for the recurrent network are learned using an evolutionary strategy. This network is multi-stable and its equilibrium states are associated with different pattern classes. For a specified input, the system relaxes to an equilibrium state associated with an underlying pattern class.

For small signal levels, the LO detection rule is shown to involve a nonlinearity which depends on the noise density. The estimation of the noise density is a major part of the computational burden of LO detection rules. In this paper, adaptive estimation of the noise density is implemented using a radial basis function (RBF) neural network. Unlike existing algorithms, the present technique places few assumptions on the properties of the noise, and performs well under a wide variety of circumstances. Experimental results are shown which illustrate the system performance as a variety of noise densities are encountered.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374719/","accessionNumber":"4917407","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive locally optimal detection using RBF neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive locally optimal detection using RBF neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374719.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030972S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"1","articleId":"374719","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374722,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This can be achieved by an adaptive and flexible interface that is robust regardless of electrode location, strength of remaining muscle activity or even personal conditions. A real-time application of an artificial neural network that can accurate recognize the MES signature is proposed in this paper. MES features are first extracted through Fourier analysis and clustered using the fuzzy c-means algorithm. Data obtained by this unsupervised learning technique are then automatically targeted and presented to a multilayer perceptron type neural network. For real-time operation, a digital signal processor operates over the resulting set of weights and maps the incoming signal to the stimulus control domain. Results show a highly accurate discrimination of the control signal over interference patterns.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374728","startPage":"3098","endPage":"3103 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374728.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Myoelectric signal recognition using fuzzy clustering and artificial neural networks in real time","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Muscles","Artificial neural networks","Automatic control","Neuromuscular stimulation","Impedance","Robustness","Electrodes","Feature extraction","Data mining","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier analysis","unsupervised learning","multilayer perceptrons","medical signal processing","muscle","neurophysiology","electromyography","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["myoelectric signal recognition","fuzzy clustering","artificial neural networks","EMG-controlled functional neuromuscular stimulation","denervated muscle","MES signature","Fourier analysis","fuzzy c-means algorithm","unsupervised learning","multilayer perceptron","digital signal processor","stimulus control domain"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374728/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Myoelectric signal recognition using fuzzy clustering and artificial neural networks in real time","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4917416","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Myoelectric signal recognition using fuzzy clustering and artificial neural networks in real time","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037317S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"8","articleId":"374728","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374729,"authors":[{"name":"Pau-Choo Chung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Pau-Choo Chung","id":"37087166005"},{"name":"E-Liang Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"E-Liang Chen","id":"37087164239"},{"name":"Ching-Tsorng Tsai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ching-Tsorng Tsai","id":"37087419577"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1901-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"374729","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":71},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=374729","abstract":"A pattern recognition system based on hierarchical neural networks is proposed in this paper. The hierarchical system consists of two levels of networks: low-level for feature extraction and high-level for object recognition. The low-level is a competitive Hopfield neural network (CHNN) which detects the dominant points of a target shape to be the pattern features, based on the minimization of a cost function. The CHNN is implemented by incorporating a winner-take-all strategy in the network. By imposing the winner-take-all rule, one is relieved from deciding the suitable values of the weighting factors in the cost function. Furthermore, from the experimental results, the authors also find that the proposed CHNN performs very well in determining the dominant points of a target shape. After the features have been extracted, they are applied to the high-level multilayered network for object recognition. Because the multilayer network has high robustness to the pattern variations, the recognition system is found to possess high noise tolerance capability. Experimental results show that the system can recognize all the objects correctly when the percentage of noises is under 10%. Even when the percentage of noises reaches 40%, the recognition ratio is still over 90%.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374729","startPage":"3104","endPage":"3109 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374729.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pattern recognition using a hierarchical neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pattern recognition","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Object recognition","Shape","Cost function","Hierarchical systems","Hopfield neural networks","Nonhomogeneous media","Noise robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural nets","multilayer perceptrons","object recognition","feature extraction","unsupervised learning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pattern recognition","hierarchical neural network","low-level neural net","feature extraction","high-level neural net","object recognition","competitive Hopfield neural network","dominant points","cost function minimisation","winner-take-all strategy","high-level multilayered network","pattern variations","high noise tolerance capability"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Pattern recognition using a hierarchical neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4917417","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pattern recognition using a hierarchical neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039426S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"1","articleId":"374729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374732,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Chaos exhibits extremely sensitive dependence on initial conditions; this tends to prevent the prediction the behavior of a chaotic system.

This study proposes a methodology for synchronizing chaos by resorting to artificial neural networks (ANN's). The ANN's are capable of approximately learning the chaotic behavior, and, thus, they render possible the synchronization of systems whose deterministic governing equations are not sufficiently well known. This requires training them with experimentally obtained time-series data and the aid of common driving signals.

A network structure is proposed to realize the identification network, with which the motion of the controlled object can be simulated. This network is introduced into a neural-network-based control system called \"self-organizing neural-net-controller system\" (SONCS), which has been developed as an adaptive control system for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). On the advantage of the network's simulating capability, the controller in the SONCS can be quickly adapted through the process called \"imaginary training\". The efficiency of the proposed identification network is examined through the application of heading control of an AUV.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374750/","accessionNumber":"4917436","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A feedforward neural network for identification and adaptive control of autonomous underwater vehicles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A feedforward neural network for identification and adaptive control of autonomous underwater vehicles","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374750.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032524S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"10","articleId":"374750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374751,"authors":[{"name":"B.S.

However, most of these methods and ANN architectures do not take into account any a priori knowledge that is often known for the problem of interest. In this paper, a priori knowledge is utilized to encourage the output of the ANN to be a periodic function of the input. Methods are investigated and compared with the general gradient-based (backpropagation) algorithm. Results show improved convergence characteristics and, in some cases, the guarantee of output periodicity with respect to the input. Generalizations can be made to higher dimensional spaces, but these may or may not be reasonable in terms of computational time and effort.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374751","startPage":"3222","endPage":"3225 vol.5","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374751.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On training artificial neural networks to identify periodic functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374751/","displayDocTitle":"On training artificial neural networks to identify periodic functions","isConference":true,"volume":"5","accessionNumber":"4917437","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On training artificial neural networks to identify periodic functions","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374751.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04035S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374752,"authors":[{"name":"J.B.

The goal has been to model software quality and use that information to better understand the software development process. Neural network modeling methods have been applied to this field. The results reported indicate that neural network models have better predictive quality than some statistical models when predicting reliability and the number of faults. In this paper, we will explore the application of principal components analysis to neural network modeling as a way of improving the predictive quality of neural network quality models. We trained two neural nets with data collected from a large commercial software system, one with raw data, and one with principal components. Then, we compare the predictive quality of the two competing neural net models.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374764","startPage":"3295","endPage":"3300 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374764.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374764","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving neural network predictions of software quality using principal components analysis","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Software quality","Principal component analysis","Predictive models","Application software","Programming","Software engineering","Software systems","Software measurement","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["software quality","neural nets","software metrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network predictions","software quality","principal components analysis","statistical modeling","software engineering","software development process"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374764/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Improving neural network predictions of software quality using principal components analysis","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4917450","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving neural network predictions of software quality using principal components analysis","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374764.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032282S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"5","articleId":"374764","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374767,"authors":[{"name":"I.E.

In rolling element bearings (REB), the components investigated in this article, deterioration is manifested in loss of fragments of metal of the raceways or the rolling elements. Each time a rolling element passes over a defect, an impulse of vibration is generated. Impulses are generally of very short duration, generate responses in a wide range of frequencies, and are related to faults and severity. All vibration monitoring techniques are based fundamentally on the identification and quantification of these impulses. Generally when a machine is operating properly, overall vibration is small and constant (although \"beat frequencies\" may appear); however, when faults develop or when some of the dynamic processes in the machine change, the vibration spectrum also changes. The frequency spectrum, generated using fast Fourier transforms, is very useful because in the frequency domain low level signals are not masked by the presence of high level signals, and because the Fourier spectrum (phase and amplitude) describes completely the vibration of the component.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374767","startPage":"3312","endPage":"3317 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374767.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374767","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic fault recognition in mechanical components using coupled artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Artificial neural networks","Vibrations","Machinery","Couplings","Rolling bearings","Frequency domain analysis","Resonant frequency","Chemical elements","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mechanical engineering","mechanical engineering computing","failure analysis","pattern recognition","vibration measurement","computerised monitoring","monitoring","neural nets","machine bearings","fast Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic fault recognition","mechanical components","coupled artificial neural networks","vibration monitoring","operational performance information","rolling element bearings","deterioration","raceways","beat frequencies","vibration spectrum","fast Fourier transforms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374767/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Automatic fault recognition in mechanical components using coupled artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4917453","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic fault recognition in mechanical components using coupled artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374767.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077621S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":374775,"authors":[{"name":"Sung Joo Park","affiliation":["Department of Management Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sung Joo Park","id":"37087593655"},{"name":"Jin Seol Yang","affiliation":["Department of Management Science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Taejon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jin Seol Yang","id":"37087591170"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1901-X","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"374775","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":7,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Intelligent control","Intelligent networks","Traffic control","Communication system traffic control","Vehicle dynamics","Multi-layer neural network","Mathematical model","Backpropagation","Process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["road traffic","traffic control","intelligent control","neural nets","traffic engineering computing","planning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchical neural network","intelligent traffic control","complex urban traffic networks","global planning network","local control networks","traffic modeling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=374775","abstract":"The goal of this work is to develop a hierarchical neural network (HNN) architecture for providing intelligent control of complex urban traffic networks which are usually nonlinear and hard to model mathematically.

Data flow Petri nets (DFPN) are a very powerful tool to model this parallelism. In this paper, we propose a methodology applying the Hopfield neural networks to the DFPN scheduling. In DFPN, the conception of parallel computation algorithms is modelled with a graph which describes the operations set. Thus, the principle is to compute an optimal path in an oriented graph, in order to find the optimal computing time of a program with a limited number of resources. The use of neural networks with feedback connections provides a computing model capable of exploiting fine-grained parallelism to solve a rich class of optimization problems and they can achieve high computation rates by employing a massive number of simple processing elements. We describe the resolution method and show that Hopfield like neural networks are very powerful to compute the scheduling of DFPN.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374778","startPage":"3375","endPage":"3380 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374778.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374778","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hopfield neural networks for the scheduling of data flow Petri nets","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","Petri nets","Processor scheduling","Concurrent computing","Computer networks","Parallel processing","Neural networks","Parallel architectures","Hardware","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","Hopfield neural nets","scheduling","data flow graphs","Petri nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hopfield neural networks","scheduling","data flow Petri nets","parallel architectures","parallel computation algorithms","oriented graph","feedback connections","optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Hopfield neural networks for the scheduling of data flow Petri nets","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4917463","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hopfield neural networks for the scheduling of data flow Petri nets","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374778.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039769S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","articleId":"374778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374781,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Unlike the typical neural network application, the development made extensive use of expert knowledge.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374784","startPage":"3409","endPage":"3414 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374784.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374784","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network-based underwater acoustic application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Underwater acoustics","Acoustic signal detection","Signal design","Systems engineering and theory","Underwater tracking","Knowledge engineering","Acoustic applications","Government","Communication system control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater sound","neural nets","acoustic signal detection","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["underwater acoustic signal detection","neural network","signal classification","underwater acoustic data set","environmental data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374784/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"A neural network-based underwater acoustic application","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4917466","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network-based underwater acoustic application","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374784.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036728S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"1","articleId":"374784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374785,"authors":[{"name":"L.J.

These particles may cause failures during launch or in zero gravity. Because PIND testing is limited by the human senses, it is subjective and has an accuracy of less than 50%. In the research project reported here, the PIND test is standardized and automated by digitizing the analog noise signal obtained from a PIND tester and by analyzing the data using neural networks. Two types of neural networks were successfully trained and tested on the PIND data, achieving an accuracy within 1%. The results of this study indicate a significant improvement in the accuracy and reliability of PIND testing. This testing can help to eliminate the expense of false failures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374785","startPage":"3415","endPage":"3419 vol.5","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8560/00374785.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8560","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network application to particle impact noise detection","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Neurons","Humans","Circuit testing","Acoustic noise","Biological neural networks","Signal analysis","Electronic equipment testing","Automatic testing","Chemical elements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic noise","automatic testing","aerospace testing","neural nets","automatic test equipment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle impact noise detection","NASA","analog noise signal","neural networks","automatic testing","acoustic noise"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374785/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural network application to particle impact noise detection","isConference":true,"volume":"5","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4917467","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network application to particle impact noise detection","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374785.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049543S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8560","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"7","articleId":"374785","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374789,"authors":[{"name":"W.L.

Originally, Fourier transformation is used to analyze the distorted wave from the power line and a low-pass filter is used to eliminate the fundamental wave before each harmonic component is detected. Due to these complicated processes, the behavior of the active filter is delayed such that it is difficult to compensate the harmonics in real time. In order to improve the processing speed and simplify the harmonic detection process, a neural network is used to detect the harmonics in the distorted wave instead of Fourier transformation and low-pass filter. The authors simulated the distorted wave including 3rd, 5th and 7th harmonics and used a neural network to recognize each harmonic.

At first the authors make a recurrent neural network (RNN) learn the dynamics model of the flexible plate handled by a robotic manipulator. When obtaining the dynamics model, the number of input units of the NN must be considered. Flexible plates have infinite modes so a NN having finite units can not obtain the dynamics perfectly. The authors make clear a relation between the number of input units and the number of modeled modes with simulation results. Next, the authors obtain the feedfoward control input based on the RNN model using the proposed learning control method. The authors applied this method to the trajectory control of a flexible plate material.

In order to improve the selectivity of gas sensors, the time response patterns induced by changing sensor temperature, and the stationary sensor output is identified by neural network. Furthermore, the mixture ratio of gases is derived by using the stationary sensor output in response to the changing sensor temperature.

Adaptive scheduling consists of three parts: features representation of the job orders and the factory environment, a set of fixed scheduling algorithms, and an algorithm selector. The statistics on orders is represented by a small number of feature parameters. Each of the algorithms included in the algorithm set is most suitable for a specific set of orders and factory status, but no single algorithm is best under all conditions. The algorithm selector chooses one of the algorithms to optimize some scheduling performance measure, for given values of the feature parameters. To illustrate the performance of the adaptive scheduling process, 10,000 different order cases were taken from uniformly distributed data. For the simulation, the algorithm selector was implemented using a backpropagation neural network structure. The results of the computer experiments demonstrated the superiority of adaptive scheduling over all of the seven fixed scheduling strategies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374817","startPage":"3806","endPage":"3811 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374817.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374817","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive scheduling utilizing a neural network structure","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive scheduling","Neural networks","Scheduling algorithm","Backpropagation algorithms","Production facilities","Job shop scheduling","Processor scheduling","Flexible manufacturing systems","Statistics","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible manufacturing systems","production control","adaptive control","neural nets","backpropagation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive scheduling","neural network structure","flexible manufacturing systems","features representation","algorithm selector","feature parameters","scheduling performance measure optimization","backpropagation neural network structure","FMS"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374817/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive scheduling utilizing a neural network structure","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4923479","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive scheduling utilizing a neural network structure","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374817.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048525S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","articleId":"374817","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374818,"authors":[{"name":"J.

A separate self-organizing map is used to monitor the movement of the operating point of the process and to give a hint of the estimation error of the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374818","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374818.pdf","startPage":"3812","endPage":"3815 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374818","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization and simulation of quality properties in paper machine with neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374818/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Optimization and simulation of quality properties in paper machine with neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4923480","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization and simulation of quality properties in paper machine with neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374818.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061435S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"8","articleId":"374818","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374822,"authors":[{"name":"K.F.

Graphs represent powerful method of a pattern formal description. Globally optimal graph matching is a NP-complete problem. Pattern distortions and noise increase an optimal search difficulty which could be tackled using GA. This paper describes results of simple GA applied on a graph matching problem. As a conclusion, the suitable GA for an optimal graph \"isomorphism\" and \"monomorphism\" is proposed. Used coding resembles the travelling salesman problem (TSP). Consequently, performance of ordering operators has been tested. In contrast to the TSP, the fitness function depends on chromosome value positioning not ordering. It results in differences between optimal GA configuration for graph matching and for TSP.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374829","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374829.pdf","startPage":"3872","endPage":"3876 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of genetic algorithms in graph matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Application of genetic algorithms in graph matching","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4923491","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of genetic algorithms in graph matching","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374829.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035669S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"8","articleId":"374829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374833,"authors":[{"name":"T.

It has several important features compared with conventional linear methods. First, necessary functions for ASK demodulation, including wide-band noise rejection, pulse waveform shaping, and decoding, can be embodied in a single neural network. This means these functions are not separately designed but unified in a learning and organizing process. Second, these functions can be self-organized through the learning. Supervised learning algorithms, such as the backpropagation algorithm, can be applied for this purpose. Finally, both wide-band noise rejection and a very sharp waveform response can be simultaneously achieved. It is very difficult to be done by linear filtering.

In this equalizer, the neural network is adapted to the optimum decision boundaries as defined by the channel and noise characteristics. This problem has already been considered by Gibson et al.(1991), but for more complex decision boundaries, the simple LMS backpropagation training rule used in their paper leads to excessively large numbers of training steps. In this paper, the neural network is trained using the extended Kalman algorithm, which has been described by Iiguni, Sakai, and Tokumaru (1992). Here a different sigmoid nonlinearity is used which is easier to compute. It is shown that a significant reduction in the number of training steps is obtained. Finally, a simplified and generalized derivation of the Kalman training algorithm is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374838","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374838.pdf","startPage":"3921","endPage":"3925 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital communication channel equalizer using a Kalman-trained neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374838/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"A digital communication channel equalizer using a Kalman-trained neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4923500","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital communication channel equalizer using a Kalman-trained neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038959S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374838","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":374841,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The neural network consists of a feature extractor for each sensor used in the robotic system and a single classifier which takes input from all the feature extractors. The network is hybrid which combines the following: (a) a modified backpropagation learning rule in a self-organizing fashion, for extracting the features, and (b) the Kohonen linear vector quantization (LVQ) method to classify the objects based on the extracted features. The feature extractor detects the important features of the input image in different subelement groups of its hidden layer(s) by reproducing the input image in its output layer. The features obtained from each of the feature extractors are then fused and fed into a classifier which classifies the target based on these features. The overall hybrid network is unsupervised because it does not need the intervention of a human operator to provide the desired outputs during learning. Weight sharing is incorporated in each of the hidden layer groups of the feature extractors to reduce the number of free parameters. Also, a modified backpropagation learning rule has been used to improve the rate of convergence of the network.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374858","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374858.pdf","startPage":"4028","endPage":"4032 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple sensor target classification using an unsupervised hybrid neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Multiple sensor target classification using an unsupervised hybrid neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4923520","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple sensor target classification using an unsupervised hybrid neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374858.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067259S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374863,"authors":[{"name":"A.

On the other hand, humans are extremely adept in performing these functions. It has been suggested by the studies of experimental psychology that the task of matching rotated and translated 3-D objects by humans is done by mentally rotating and translating gradually one of the objects into the orientation of the other and then testing for a match. Motivated by these studies, the authors present a novel and robust neural network solution for these tasks based on detected range data from 3-D objects. The method operates in two stages: the object is first parametrically represented by a continuous distance transform network (CDTN) which converts the range data (surface points) into a continuous distance transform representation of the 3-D object. When later presented with range data obtained from the distorted and partially-viewed object without point correspondence, this 3-D distance transform representation allows the mismatch information to backpropagate through the CDTN so as to gradually align the best similarity transform of the distorted object. Based on the use of distance transform representation, the distance measure between the exemplar object and the aligned distorted object can be easily computed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374865","startPage":"4066","endPage":"4071 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374865.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network representation of continuous 3-D distance transform for invariant object recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Object recognition","Discrete transforms","Surface reconstruction","Object detection","Humans","Shape","Pattern recognition","Testing","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["object recognition","neural nets","image matching","image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network representation","continuous 3-D distance transform","invariant object recognition","detection noise","partial object viewing","continuous distance transform network","range data","surface points","distance measure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neural network representation of continuous 3-D distance transform for invariant object recognition","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4923527","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network representation of continuous 3-D distance transform for invariant object recognition","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374865.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035544S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374868,"authors":[{"name":"Rongrui Xiao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO, USA"],"lastName":"Rongrui Xiao","id":"37086977838"},{"name":"M.R.

By learning with self-supervision, the authors' LVQ neural model finds near-optimal clustering from image data and builds a compression codebook in the weight connections. The compression result is competitive comparing with JPEG and a wavelet method which has previously been developed as a fingerprint image compression standard.

It is shown how DSLVQ adjusts the influence of different input features according to their relevance for classification. Using a weighted distance function DSLVQ thereby performs feature selection along with classification. The results are compared with those of a GA which minimizes the number of features taken for classification while maximizing classification performance. The multichannel EEG patterns used in this paper stem from a study for the construction of a brain-computer interface, which is a system designed for handicapped persons to help them use their EEG for control of their environment. For such a system, reliable EEG classification, i.e. differentiation of several distinctive EEG patterns, is vital. In practice the number of electrodes for EEG recordings can be high (up to 56 and more) and different frequency bands and time intervals for each electrode can be used for classification simultaneously. This shows the importance of methods automatically selecting the most distinctive out of a number of available features.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374888","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374888.pdf","startPage":"3448","endPage":"3451 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374888","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Feature selection with distinction sensitive learning vector quantisation and genetic algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374888/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Feature selection with distinction sensitive learning vector quantisation and genetic algorithms","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4946409","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature selection with distinction sensitive learning vector quantisation and genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374888.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049139S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"17","articleId":"374888","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":374893,"authors":[{"name":"B.

Both classifiers were trained to classify 5 types of chromosomes according to density profile features. The MLP NN classifier outperformed the Bayes piecewise classifier for all the combinations of features and for all the sizes of training sets. The MLP classifier was found to be almost unsusceptible to the ratio of the number of training vectors to the number of features, where the piecewise classifier was highly depended on this ratio. The piecewise classifier required higher number of training vectors whenever there was an increase in the number of features used. Therefore, the Bayes piecewise classifier is limited to large data sets. However, the MLP classifier performed well even for small data sets. As far as our chromosome data is considered, the MLP NN classifier ability to generalize from the training set to test vectors is evidently stronger than that of the Bayes piecewise classifier.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multilayer perceptrons","Neural networks","Multi-layer neural network","Biological cells","Humans","Backpropagation algorithms","Medical diagnostic imaging","Feedforward neural networks","Genetics","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular biophysics","medical diagnostic computing","multilayer perceptrons","Bayes methods","pattern classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer perceptron neural network","Bayes piecewise classifier","chromosome classification","density profile features","training vectors"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374893","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374893.pdf","startPage":"3472","endPage":"3477 vol.6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison of multilayer perceptron neural network and Bayes piecewise classifier for chromosome classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=374893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A comparison of multilayer perceptron neural network and Bayes piecewise classifier for chromosome classification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374893/","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4946414","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A comparison of multilayer perceptron neural network and Bayes piecewise classifier for chromosome classification","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374893.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047675S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"5","articleId":"374893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":374894,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

The utility of artificial neural networks trained with the backpropagation, the Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps algorithm, and the genetics based machine learning (GBML) in classifying EMG data has been demonstrated. A hybrid diagnostic system was also introduced that combines the above neural network and GBML models. In this paper the WISARD net is applied on the same set of EMG data. The WISARD (Wilkie, Stonham, Aleksander Recognition Device) is an implementation in hardware or software of an n-tuple sampling technique. Results suggest that although the diagnostic performance of the WISARD models is of the order of 80%, that being comparable to the above mentioned three systems, training time has been significantly reduced. In addition, the hardware or software implementation of the WISARD net is simpler than the other three systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374894","startPage":"3478","endPage":"3483 vol.6","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374894","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374894.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid neural network electromyographic system: incorporating the WISARD net","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374894/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid neural network electromyographic system: incorporating the WISARD net","isConference":true,"volume":"6","accessionNumber":"4946415","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid neural network electromyographic system: incorporating the WISARD net","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374894.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02898S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"3","articleId":"374894","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":374904,"authors":[{"name":"T.

In a normal neural network's mechanism, during processing of rules, one can observe the following behaviors: case 1) If a neural network does not have enough neurons to be satisfied to infer, then the input weight vector will tend to fluctuate greatly even after a certain period of the learning process. Case 2) If a neural network has enough neurons to infer and even if the input weight vector of each neuron will converge to a certain value, one will be able to turn out unnecessary neurons from the network in the calculation. By observing such behaviors, one can generate or annihilate the specified neurons respectively to achieve an overall good system. In proposed method, the authors give a procedure to derive the neuron generation/annihilation automatically and apply the procedure to a learning system in which the experimental data related to hepatobiliary disorders were used. After learning by using 107 data chosen randomly from all database, the proposed system correctly diagnosed 93% of test data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374904/","accessionNumber":"4946427","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Reasoning and learning method for fuzzy rules using neural networks and its application to medical diagnosis","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reasoning and learning method for fuzzy rules using neural networks and its application to medical diagnosis","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374904.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024561S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374908,"authors":[{"name":"C.

However, alternate routes introduce instability under heavy and overloaded conditions, and under these load conditions network performance is found to deteriorate. To alleviate this problem, a control mechanism that reserves a traction of the capacity of each link for direct routed calls is used. In this paper, a traffic management scheme is developed to enhance the performance of a mesh-connected, circuit-switched satellite communication network. The network load is measured and the network is continually adapted by reconfiguring the map to suit the current traffic conditions. The reconfiguration of the network is done by properly allocating the capacity of each link and placing an optimal reservation on each link. The optimization is done by using a neural network-based optimization technique called mean field annealing. The simulation results show that this method of traffic management performs better than pure dynamic routing with a fixed configuration.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374911","startPage":"3577","endPage":"3582 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374911.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374911","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Traffic management of a satellite communication network using mean field annealing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Satellite communication","Traffic control","Switching circuits","Communication switching","Communication system control","Communication system traffic control","Current measurement","Neural networks","Annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["satellite communication","telecommunication traffic","neural nets","simulated annealing","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["traffic management","satellite communication network","mean field annealing","network reconfiguration","optimization","neural network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Traffic management of a satellite communication network using mean field annealing","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4946434","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Traffic management of a satellite communication network using mean field annealing","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374911.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037442S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"1","articleId":"374911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":374912,"authors":[{"name":"Changsoo Eun","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Electronics Research Center, University of Texas, Austin, Austin, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Changsoo Eun","id":"37087339593"},{"name":"E.J.

(1992) to design an equalizer for a nonlinear channel.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374912","startPage":"3582a","endPage":"3586 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374912.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Utilization of neural network signal processing in the design of a predistorter for a nonlinear telecommunication channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Signal processing","Intelligent networks","Process design","Signal design","Communication channels","Filters","Nonlinear systems","Inverse problems","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["telecommunication channels","signal processing","digital communication","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complex neural network","signal processing","predistorter","nonlinear telecommunication channel","digital telecommunication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374912/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"Utilization of neural network signal processing in the design of a predistorter for a nonlinear telecommunication channel","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4946435","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Utilization of neural network signal processing in the design of a predistorter for a nonlinear telecommunication channel","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374912.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029876S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"1","articleId":"374912","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374914,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The wavelet network is a two-layer localized receptive field network whose output nodes form a linear combination of the wavelet orthonormal basis functions computed by the hidden layer nodes. The wavelet orthonormal basis is a family of functions which is built by dilating and translating the Morlet mother wavelet. An appropriate wavelet basis leads to the wavelet network which is capable of forming the best approximation to any continuous nonlinear mapping up to an arbitrary resolution. Such an approximation introduces nonlinear decision making ability into the wavelet equalizer in order to compensate the nonlinear channel distortion. Since the wavelet network network has a linear-in-the parameters structure, the fast-convergent recursive least square algorithm can readily be used to train the equalizer and the training is guaranteed to converge a single global minimum of the mean square error surface.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374917/","accessionNumber":"4951547","isConference":true,"volume":"6","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Nonlinear communication channel equalization using wavelet neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonlinear communication channel equalization using wavelet neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.02752S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"3","articleId":"374917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374918,"authors":[{"name":"A.

By interpolating and extrapolating the virtual cell-loss data, the neural network can accurately estimate the cell-loss rate for various bandwidths and traffic loads. This method therefore does not require the observation of actual cell-loss events in a running ATM node. To learn the accurate mean cell-loss rate from widely-distributed observed cell-loss data, the smoothed-log-conversion method is proposed, in which the teacher signal is generated from the weighted sum of the neural-network-estimated cell-loss rate and the data observed at virtual buffers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374918","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374918.pdf","startPage":"3611","endPage":"3616 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATM call admission control using a neural network trained with a virtual output buffer method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374918/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"ATM call admission control using a neural network trained with a virtual output buffer method","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4946440","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATM call admission control using a neural network trained with a virtual output buffer method","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374918.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037345S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"15","articleId":"374918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":374919,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Empirical research provided substantial evidence on the usefulness of earnings in stock market valuation and capital market research. Unfortunately, there has been little or weak empirical evidence in predicting earnings. From the empirical evidence provided thus far, it is debatable whether a number of underlying econometric and statistical issues were fully resolved, mainly because of the nature of accounting and financial data. Linear and logistic regression approaches were applied in the past for providing prediction models, but their predicting ability was not robust. In an attempt to improve the prediction ability and robustness of the prediction models and thus avoid the inherent econometric and statistical problems in prior research, a different approach was employed. This paper examines the application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the prediction of future earnings. The variable to be predicted was a dichotomous realization of the change in earnings per share, adjusted for the drift in the prior earnings changes, and the predictor variables which were used had been identified, in this study, to have the highest information content for the prediction. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) feedforward neural network architecture was used, due to its suitability as a classifier and its implementation simplicity on a sequential computer. In contrast with prior applications of ANNs in accounting, and business in general, this study also focused in the selection of an efficient and robust training algorithm. The complexity and the size of the problem, in combination with the scattered nature of pooled accounting data, demanded that a training algorithm should guarantee convergence without oscillations and be relatively fast in order to be used in such a problem. Therefore, the conjugate gradient training algorithm, originally adapted for the efficient training of ANNs by Charalambous (1992), was employed. The algorithm considers the training of the network as a multi-variable function minimization problem, employing a line search in each iteration. The logistic regression method was also examined in parallel with the ANN approach, to compare the performance of the two methods in a problem which cannot be fully solved, since it is proved that earnings follow a random walk model. Comparing the performance of the two models examined, it was found that the ANN approach performed slightly better than the logit approach. Moreover, different accounting variables were identified as earnings predictors. Future research should investigate the usefulness of other accounting information to further improve the predictability of earnings.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374920","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8561/00374920.pdf","startPage":"3629","endPage":"3633 vol.6","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The application of artificial neural networks in the prediction of earnings","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","displayDocTitle":"The application of artificial neural networks in the prediction of earnings","isConference":true,"volume":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4946442","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The application of artificial neural networks in the prediction of earnings","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374920.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029232S","chronDate":"June 28 1994-July 2 1994","isNumber":"8561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"7","articleId":"374920","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374921,"authors":[{"name":"M.L.

Such a system could reduce the need for redundant or oversized signs by assisting drivers in acquiring roadway information. Transportation agencies could use such a system as the first step in an automated highway sign inventory system. Currently, a human operator must watch hours of highway videos to complete this inventory. While only warning signs were considered in this study, the procedure was designed to be easily adapted to all highway signs. The basic approach is to digitize a roadway image and segment this image, using a back-propagation neural network, into eight colors that are important to highway sign detection. Next, the system scans the image for color regions that may possibly represent highway warning signs. Upon finding possible warning sign regions, these regions are further analyzed by a second back-propagation neural network to determine if their shape corresponds to that of a highway warning sign.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374944/","accessionNumber":"4973676","isConference":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Detection of highway warning signs in natural video images using color image processing and neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of highway warning signs in natural video images using color image processing and neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374944.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057172S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"11","articleId":"374944","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":374947,"authors":[{"name":"F.

But there is the possibility of generating the same slab values even when the inputs are different. To avoid this problem, we adopt a mask which covers some parts of the input. This enables us to reflect the difference of input pattern to slab values with masks. Furthermore, we adopt the genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the masks. We can generate various effective masks automatically.

The inputs of the second order neural network (SONN) described consist of geometrically related nonlinear combinations of two pixels, and can be used for shift invariant pattern recognition. But the number of SONN input nodes increases in proportion to N/sup 2/, where N is the dimension of the input patterns, even if we only consider the shift invariance. Such large number of input nodes lead to slower learning aid recognition. In this paper, we propose a method for reducing the number of shift invariant SONN input nodes using combinations of input pattern pixels and the principle component analysis. Using the proposed method we are able to implement a shift invariant second order neural network with 2/5*N nodes. Due to the reduced number of input nodes, a 50% reduction in the learning and recognition time was obtained.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374955","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8562/00374955.pdf","startPage":"4283","endPage":"4287 vol.7","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374955","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reduced shift invariant second order neural networks using principal component analysis and pixel combinations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374955/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Reduced shift invariant second order neural networks using principal component analysis and pixel combinations","isConference":true,"volume":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4973687","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reduced shift invariant second order neural networks using principal component analysis and pixel combinations","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374955.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063264S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","articleId":"374955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374957,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

CLM is very useful for extracting scale and rotation invariant features.

This problem can be solved by using an augmented second order neural network (SONN). It requires, however, a connection complexity O(n/sup 2/) for input feature extraction which is too high to be implemented. The proposed method reduces the connection complexity to O(n*log(n)) by using TINN.

The extracted features are then presented to a self-organizing feature map or Kohonen network for automatic detection and classification of cloud areas. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated under many situations which are considered difficult for the conventional methods. The proposed method also possesses some interesting classification capabilities which can facilitate future studies on global climatology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374963","startPage":"4327","endPage":"4332 vol.7","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8562/00374963.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection and classification of cloud data from geostationary satellite using artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Artificial satellites","Artificial neural networks","Neural networks","Feature extraction","Infrared detectors","Data mining","Image processing","Transforms","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clouds","remote sensing","image classification","singular value decomposition","self-organising feature maps","feature extraction","image texture","infrared imaging","atmospheric techniques","geophysics computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud data classification","geostationary satellite","neural networks","IR range","visible range","singular value decomposition","image textural feature extraction","self-organizing feature map","Kohonen network","remote sensing","measurement technique","IR imaging","atmosphere meteorology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374963/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Detection and classification of cloud data from geostationary satellite using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4973695","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection and classification of cloud data from geostationary satellite using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374963.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027749S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"374963","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":374968,"authors":[{"name":"D.S.

The second involves the input nodes: by the examination of the connecting weights between the input nodes and the following hidden layer, we can determinate which features are actually relevant for our classification problem, and then eliminate the useless ones. Through the problem of recognising the French vowel /a/, we show that we can obtain a reduced structure that still can learn.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374981/","accessionNumber":"4956979","isConference":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Diminishing the number of nodes in multi-layered neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diminishing the number of nodes in multi-layered neural networks","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374981.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026942S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"3","articleId":"374981","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":374982,"authors":[{"name":"C.

In this study we investigate the use of acoustic processing based on cochlear models and neural-like processing as a means of arriving at noise robust acoustic representation of speech. However, unlike previous work based on cochlear models that used cochlear filter parameters based on neurophysiological data, we optimize cochlear filter shape and thresholds to reduce the noise contribution in the resulting acoustic representations. Results suggest that average SNR improvements of the order of 5-10 dB can be obtained for noise corrupted signals with SNRs near 0-6 dB for realistic noise such as cafeteria noise. Furthermore, using a neural network to include context and arrive at a lower dimensional representation can lead to further improvements in SNR.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.374982","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8562/00374982.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8562","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.374982","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","startPage":"4425","endPage":"4430 vol.7","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neuromorphic speech processing for noisy environments","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=374982","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Neuromorphic speech processing for noisy environments","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/374982/","isConference":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4956980","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neuromorphic speech processing for noisy environments","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00374982.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030191S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"4","articleId":"374982","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":374983,"authors":[{"name":"M.J.

The first method is the MLP network with linear path through, and the second method is a linear model with nonlinear error correction. Finally the two methods are tested. A thermal mixing process is used as a test system. This system is a multivariable and nonlinear process.

The proposed algorithm generates a near-maximal planar subgraph from a nonplanar or a planar graph within O(1) time. The problem can be defined as a \"set selection problem\" based on the \"between-l-and-k-out-of-n\" design rule in SDNN/V algorithm, The results of solving the graph planarization problem using a simulator of SDNN/V show that the computation in parallel execution is only three steps to get one of the near-optimum solutions. However, the obtained solutions are not always maximal subgraphs. In order to improve the quality of the solutions, this paper presents a numbering method for neurons in an order of importance within each constraint satisfaction set. From the result of simulation, it is shown that the numbering method has an effect on improving the quality of the solutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375020/","accessionNumber":"4962677","isConference":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Solving a near-maximal graph planarization problem using strictly digital neural networks with virtual slack-neurons","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving a near-maximal graph planarization problem using strictly digital neural networks with virtual slack-neurons","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00375020.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051357S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"375020","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":375025,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Many researchers, who want to find the global minimum of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), have introduced various approaches to solve such conditions including heuristics, genetic algorithms, hybrid algorithms of some methods, etc. We introduce a simple heuristic algorithm which embeds the classical local search heuristics into the optimization neural network. The proposed algorithm is characterized with the best neighbors selection, which is used in the dynamic scheduling and in ordering the update sequence of neurons, and with the decidability check which is used to guarantee the near-optimal solution. The proposed algorithm enhances both the convergence speed and the quality of solutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375026/","accessionNumber":"4957015","isConference":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic neural network with heuristics","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic neural network with heuristics","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00375026.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062011S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"3","articleId":"375026","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":375027,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

These heuristics are often very time consuming, because of the need for randomization or Monte Carlo simulation during the search for solutions. The random neural network (RNN) model has the nice property of being analytically solvable, and therefore computationally fast, so that any application of the model is based on obtaining solutions to a simple system of fixed-point equations. In this paper we first introduce the binary random network model and show that it has a Hopfield energy which it minimizes and which can be used for optimization problems. We illustrate this by the search for heuristic solutions to the minimum node covering problem (MCP) for graphs, which we also then proceed to solve using the full RNN. We then turn to a definition of Hopfield energy for the RNN model, and prove that it is minimized at each fixed-point iteration used in solving the RNN model's equations. This is again illustrated in relation to the MCP.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.375032","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8562/00375032.pdf","startPage":"4681","endPage":"4686 vol.7","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.375032","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hopfield energy of the random neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375032/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Hopfield energy of the random neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"7","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4957019","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hopfield energy of the random neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00375032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034545S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"375032","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":375035,"authors":[{"name":"Gangsheng Wang","affiliation":["Center for Communications and Signal Processing Research, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, University Heights, Newark, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Gangsheng Wang","id":"37087219447"},{"name":"N.

As such the problem has received considerable attention in the past and various attempts for designing estimators via the statistical methodology were made. In this paper the design of the ship position estimator via neural networks is considered. The ship position estimation is viewed as an adaptive estimation problem for partially unknown systems. New powerful neural estimators based on dynamic recurrent neural networks are applied to the solution of the ship position problem. The new proposed neural estimators, and the state of the art statistical filters, are comparatively evaluated via extensive simulations. The results show that the neural algorithms have excellent performance, achieving significant computational savings due to their massively parallel structure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375037/","accessionNumber":"4957023","isConference":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neural network estimators: application to ship position estimation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network estimators: application to ship position estimation","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00375037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058577S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"2","articleId":"375037","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":375039,"authors":[{"name":"K.Y.

The fully connected recurrent neural network (FRNN), where all neurons are coupled to one another, is difficult to train and to converge in a short time. The diagonal recurrent neural network (DRNN) is a modified model of FRNN. It requires fewer weights than FRNN and rapid convergence has been demonstrated. A dynamic backpropagation algorithm coupled with adaptive learning rate guarantees even faster convergence. Many experiments are conducted to provide the one-day ahead load forecast, and the results are compared. The effect of temperatures and functional-link net mapping are also studied by including them as the network's inputs.

The neural network has three layers: one input layer, one hidden layer and one output layer. The inputs of the neural network are original image data, while the outputs are reconstructed image data which are close to the inputs. If the amount of data required to store the hidden unit values and the connection weights to the output layer of the neural network is less than the original data, compression is achieved. In our experiments, we achieved a compression ratio of about 10 with good reconstructed image quality. The neural network construction algorithm we used has an attractive feature that each addition of a hidden unit to the network will always improve the image quality. Thus our compression scheme is flexible in the sense that the user can trade between image quality and compression ratio depending on the application requirements.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICNN.1994.375045","startPage":"4761","endPage":"4765 vol.7","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3013/8562/00375045.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'94)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNN.1994.375045","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8562","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image compression using a feedforward neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image coding","Neural networks","Feedforward neural networks","Image reconstruction","Image quality","Pixel","Signal to noise ratio","Digital images","Information systems","Computer science"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","data compression","image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural network","image compression","input layer","hidden layer","output layer","connection weights","image reconstruction","image quality"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375045/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Image compression using a feedforward neural network","isConference":true,"volume":"7","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"28 June-2 July 1994","accessionNumber":"4962691","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image compression using a feedforward neural network","confLoc":"Orlando, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"00375045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068466S","chronDate":"27 Jun-2 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8562","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3013","citationCount":"7","articleId":"375045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":375047,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

Although structural expansion has been considered as a means of increasing diversity so as to benefit the GA optimization process in a changing world, it was seldom studied in the context of a multi-stage reinforced environment. This paper compares three chromosome coding schemes: monoploidy, triploidy (as a special case of polyploidy), and structural expansion, and discusses their impacts on multiple fuzzy-staged game-playing strategies. We show that when polyploid chromosomes are employed to cope with the changing environment in the domain of game-playing, the average learning result is apparently better than the learning curves in which only monoploidy is used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IJCF.1994.375133","startPage":"223","endPage":"227","displayPublicationTitle":"NAFIPS/IFIS/NASA '94.

In principle, PIM chips can replace the memory of any processor, including a supercomputer. To validate the notion of integrating SIMD computing into conventional processors on a more modest scale, we have built a half dozen Terasys workstations, which are Sun Microsystems Sparcstation-2 workstations in which 8 megabytes of address space consist of PIM memory holding 32K single-bit ALUs. We have designed and implemented a high-level parallel language, called data parallel bit C (dbC), for Terasys and demonstrated that dbC applications using the PIM memory as a SIMD array run at the speed of multiple Cray-YMP processors. Thus, we can deliver supercomputer performance for a small fraction of supercomputer cost. Since the successful creation of the Terasys research prototype, we have begun work on processing in memory in a supercomputer setting. In a collaborative research project, we are working with Cray Computer to incorporate a new Cray-designed implementation of the PIM chips into two octants of Cray-3 memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.375174","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8564","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.375174","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/8564/00375174.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"31","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Processing in memory: the Terasys massively parallel PIM array","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Processing in memory: the Terasys massively parallel PIM array","volume":"28","issue":"4","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4941545","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375174/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Processing in memory: the Terasys massively parallel PIM array","sourcePdf":"00375174.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034979S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8564","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"186","articleId":"375174","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":375217,"authors":[{"name":"R.Y.

On-wafer waveform and S-parameter measurements of monolithic millimeter-wave integrated circuits are demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Millimeter wave measurements","Probes","Integrated circuit measurements","Transmission line measurements","Millimeter wave integrated circuits","Gallium arsenide","Coplanar transmission lines","Distributed parameter circuits","Circuit analysis","Hybrid integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["probes","integrated circuit testing","S-parameters","integrated circuit measurement","network analysers","gallium arsenide","coplanar waveguides","test equipment","MIMIC","millimetre wave measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["millimeter-wave onwafer measurements","waveform measurements","network measurements","active probes","GaAs nonlinear transmission line","network analyzer","integrated circuit testing","low-loss quartz CPW probe tips","coplanar-waveguide probe","hybrid assembly","mechanical design","S-parameter measurements","monolithic millimeter-wave integrated circuits","MIMIC","EHF","200 GHz","2.7 ps","0.7 ps","GaAs"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.375217","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/8565/00375217.pdf","startPage":"721","endPage":"729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8565","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.375217","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Millimeter-wave on-wafer waveform and network measurements using active probes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=375217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Millimeter-wave on-wafer waveform and network measurements using active probes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375217/","volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4953296","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Millimeter-wave on-wafer waveform and network measurements using active probes","sourcePdf":"00375217.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037055S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8565","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"34","articleId":"375217","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":375218,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Yu Chi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA","University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, US"],"lastName":"Chen-Yu Chi","id":"37286182200"},{"name":"G.M.

The software, which is part command- and part menu-driven, allows a choice of four PID controllers using different integral wind-up strategies and transfer function entry of the actuator and plant dynamics. Most realistic control systems contain nonlinearities of some form. One nonlinearity commonly found in control systems is a saturating element. If integral control is applied to such a system to eliminate steady state error, an undesired side effect known as integrator windup may occur when large setpoint changes are made. This effect leads to a characteristic step response with a large overshoot and a very high settling time. To avoid this situation, many different anti-windup strategies have been suggested. This article discusses a software package that has been developed in the SIMULINK/MATLAB environment to investigate and compare the performance of four different anti-windup implementations for PI or PID controllers. The software is partially menu-driven and enables the user to easily enter his own actuator and plant transfer functions to study the performance with the different controllers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375281/","volume":"15","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4941136","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"An analysis package comparing PID anti-windup strategies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis package comparing PID anti-windup strategies","sourcePdf":"00375281.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030113S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8566","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"190","articleId":"375281","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":375385,"authors":[{"name":"T.D.

This is motivated not only by portable electronics, in which battery weight and size is critical, but by heat dissipation issues in larger desktop and parallel machines as well. By identifying the major modes of computation of these processors and by proposing figures of merit for each of these modes, a power analysis methodology is developed. It allows the energy efficiency of various architectures to be quantified, and provides techniques for either individually optimizing or trading off throughput and energy consumption.

For many video systems a combination of processor and VLSI chip provides a low cost solution that meets given performance requirements. Thus tools for analyzing whether a video function is best implemented in hardware (VLSI) or in software (on a VLIW processor) are valuable. An optimization approach is presented which can efficiently map video computations to hardware or software. The technique maps fast (I)DCT-II applications to an existing VLIW video signal processor chip. Our research shows that the optimized mapping to VLSI architectures provides up to 66% fewer busses than previous research. This research is important for industry since the partitioning of applications into software or hardware has a significant impact on the overall cost and performance of video processing systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","pdfPath":"/iel5/3016/8568/00375410.pdf","startPage":"41","endPage":"48 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the Twenty-Eighth Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences","doi":"10.1109/HICSS.1995.375410","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HICSS.1995.375410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8568","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=375410","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized mapping of video applications to hardware-software for VLSI architectures","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Very large scale integration","VLIW","Hardware","Computer architecture","Costs","Application software","Job shop scheduling","Processor scheduling","Software tools","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video signal processing","VLSI","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer optimization","video computations","VLSI architectures","video systems","optimized mapping","scheduling","VLIW processor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375410/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-6 Jan 1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimized mapping of video applications to hardware-software for VLSI architectures","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4869886","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"3-6 Jan. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized mapping of video applications to hardware-software for VLSI architectures","confLoc":"Wailea, HI, USA","sourcePdf":"00375410.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031012S","chronDate":"3-6 Jan 1995","isNumber":"8568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3016","articleId":"375410","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":375617,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Unfortunately however, none of the current versions of OOA have included a validation technique tailored to the object oriented approach. Most, instead, merely recommend document reviews without specifying what kinds of problems to look for. The paper explores the question by applying a natural language parser to a requirements document, extracting candidate objects, methods and associations, composing them into an object model diagram, and then comparing the results to those determined by manual OOA. To do this, we have adapted an automated natural language parser and used it to examine several high level specifications.

Green's function method is used in our model and a new development of this method allows us to calculate the side-mode power. A transverse model is developed allowing the calculation of the spatially dependent refractive index and coupling coefficient from the designed AMC-DFB laser structures. Modeling results show that the effective index variation, associated with that of the coupling coefficient, plays an important role in affecting the laser's characteristics and has to be balanced to improve single-mode behavior. The SHB is studied experimentally by measuring the spontaneous emission radiated from a transparent window inside the electrode. The results clearly show, for the first time, the existence of a hole in the carrier density distribution due to the /spl lambda//4 phase-shift in a highly coupled laser.

This paper discusses VLSI trends and how VLSI's can be applied to realize ATM switching node systems for B-ISDN. Implementing a practical ATM node system will require the development of technologies such as high-throughput ATM switch LSI's with up to 10 Gb/s capacity and SDH termination technology based on optical fiber transmission. An ATM traffic-handling mechanism with Quality of Service (QoS) controls such as ATM layer performance monitoring, virtual channel handling, usage parameter control, and VP shaping requires several hundred thousand logic gates and several megabytes of high-speed static RAM; VLSI's must be introduced if such mechanisms are to be implemented. ATM node system architecture is based on design principles of a building-block-type structure and hierarchical multiplexing. The basic ATM call handling module, the AHM, is composed mainly of a line termination block and a self-routing switch block; we analyzed this module from the viewpoint of the amount of hardware it requires. Finally, future ATM node systems are discussed on the basis of 0.2-/spl mu/m VLSI development trends and hardware requirements such as the need for ultrahigh integration of logic gate with memory, multichip modules, and low power dissipation technology.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.375951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8575/00375951.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.375951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ATM in B-ISDN communication systems and VLSI realization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=375951","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375951/","displayDocTitle":"ATM in B-ISDN communication systems and VLSI realization","volume":"30","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4969267","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ATM in B-ISDN communication systems and VLSI realization","sourcePdf":"00375951.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040107S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"15","articleId":"375951","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":375953,"authors":[{"name":"Kyeongho Lee","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kyeongho Lee","id":"37281499100"},{"name":"Sungjoon Kim","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Sungjoon Kim","id":"37350236900"},{"name":"Gijung Ahn","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gijung Ahn","id":"37380821500"},{"name":"Deog-Kyoon Jeong","affiliation":["Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Deog-Kyoon Jeong","id":"38283910000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9200"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-173X"}],"articleNumber":"375953","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":45,"totalDownloads":952},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Solid-State Circuits Society","url":"http://ewh.ieee.org/soc/sscs/index.php"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data communication","Phase locked loops","CMOS technology","Charge pumps","Testing","Robustness","Clocks","Bridges","Communication cables","Voting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS digital integrated circuits","data communication equipment","digital phase locked loops","data communication","clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS serial link","fully duplexed data communication","central charge pump PLL","multiphase clocks","oversampling","bidirectional bridge","digital PLL","process-independent data recovery","low-ratio oversampling","majority voting","parallel data recovery scheme","scaled CMOS technology","unidirectional mode operation","pseudo random data patterns","500 Mbit/s","1.2 micron","320 Mbit/s"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a CMOS serial link allowing fully duplexed 500 Mbaud serial data communication. The CMOS serial link is a robust and low-cost solution to high data rate requirements. A central charge pump PLL for generating multiphase clocks for oversampling is shared by several serial link channels. Fully duplexed serial data communication is realized in the bidirectional bridge by separating incoming data from the mixed signal on the cable end. The digital PLL accomplishes process-independent data recovery by using a low-ratio oversampling, a majority voting, and a parallel data recovery scheme. Mostly, digital approach could extend its bandwidth further with scaled CMOS technology. A single channel serial link and a charge pump PLL are integrated in a test chip using 1.2 /spl mu/m CMOS process technology. The test chip confirms upto 500 Mbaud unidirectional mode operation and 320 Mbaud fully duplexed mode operation with pseudo random data patterns.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.375953","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8575/00375953.pdf","startPage":"353","endPage":"364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.375953","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A CMOS serial link for fully duplexed data communication","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=375953","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375953/","displayDocTitle":"A CMOS serial link for fully duplexed data communication","volume":"30","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4969269","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A CMOS serial link for fully duplexed data communication","sourcePdf":"00375953.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049208S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"57","articleId":"375953","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":375957,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The new clocking scheme causes quite small speed degradation, because the random logic circuits in the critical path are still supplied by the full supply voltage. We also propose a clock driver which supplies half-swing clock and generates half V/sub DD/ by itself. We confirmed that the half-swing clocking scheme provided 67% power saving in a test chip fabricated with 0.5 /spl mu/m CMOS technology, ideally 75%, in the clocking circuitry, and that the degradation in speed was only 0.5 ns by circuit simulation. The key to the proposed clocking scheme is the concept that the voltage swing is reduced only for clocking circuitry, but is retained for all other circuits in the chip. This results in significant power reduction with minimal speed degradation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/4.375963","startPage":"432","endPage":"435","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel1/4/8575/00375963.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/4.375963","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Half-swing clocking scheme for 75% power saving in clocking circuitry","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Voltage","Degradation","Circuit testing","CMOS technology","Energy consumption","Large scale integration","Logic circuits","Driver circuits","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["timing circuits","large scale integration","CMOS digital integrated circuits","clocks","driver circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["half-swing clocking scheme","power saving technique","clocking circuitry","power consumption reduction","LSI supply voltage","clock driver","CMOS technology","0.5 micron"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/375963/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Half-swing clocking scheme for 75% power saving in clocking circuitry","volume":"30","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4969279","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Half-swing clocking scheme for 75% power saving in clocking circuitry","sourcePdf":"00375963.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03266S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8575","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"40","articleId":"375963","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":375965,"authors":[{"name":"Tzi-Hsiung Shu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Tzi-Hsiung Shu","id":"37356021000"},{"name":"Bang-Sup Song","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA"],"lastName":"Bang-Sup Song","id":"37274662800"},{"name":"K.

One technique, called code-error calibration, is to linearize the transfer characteristic of digital-to-analog converters (DAC's) while the other, called gain-error proration, is to evenly distribute interstage gain errors over the full conversion range. The core of the former technique is an oversampling delta-sigma ratio calibrator working synchronously with the converter. This digital calibration process constantly tracks and updates the code errors without interfering with the normal operation. The prototype converter fabricated using a 1.4-/spl mu/m BiCMOS process consumes 360 mW with a 5-V single supply and exhibits a signal-to-noise ratio of 71 dB and a maximum end-point integral nonlinearity of 1.8 LSB at a 13-b level.

These schemes can set the DRAM array free from the leakage current problem and the influence of temperature variations. Therefore, parameters for the MC-Tr, threshold voltage (V/sub th/), and the boosted voltage for the gate bias can be scaled down, and it is possible to determine the V/sub th/ of the MC-Tr simply (0.45 V at K=0.4) for the satisfaction of the small leakage current, for high speed and stable operation, and for high reliability (V/sub PP/ is below 2 V/sub CC/).

The algorithm stems from the newly developed extended Born approximation (see J. Geophys. Res., vol.98, no.B2, p.1759, 1993), which sums in a simple analytical expression an infinitude of terms contained in the Neumann series expansion of the electric field resulting from multiple scattering. Comparisons of numerical performance against a finite-difference code show that the extended Born approximation remains accurate up to conductivity contrasts of 1:1000 with respect to a homogeneous background, even with large-size scatterers and for a wide frequency range. Moreover, the new approximation is nearly as computationally efficient as the first-order Born approximation. Most importantly, we show that the mathematical form of the extended Born approximation allows one to express the nonlinear inversion of electromagnetic fields scattered by a line source as the sequential solution of two Fredholm integral equations. We compare this procedure against a more conventional iterative approach applied to a limited-angle tomography experiment. Our numerical tests show superior CPU time performance of the two-step linear inversion process.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.376039","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8577/00376039.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.376039","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"405","endPage":"415","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A two-step linear inversion of two-dimensional electrical conductivity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"A two-step linear inversion of two-dimensional electrical conductivity","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376039/","volume":"43","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4930841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A two-step linear inversion of two-dimensional electrical conductivity","sourcePdf":"00376039.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026133S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"47","articleId":"376039","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":376042,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

The temporal discretization is accomplished by invoking the central difference approximation for the temporal derivatives that appear in the first-order differential equations. From this, the final equations are temporally advanced using the classical leapfrog method. One-dimensional scattering from a dielectric slab is chosen for a test case. Provided that the maximum operating frequency times the time step is small and that the wave is adequately resolved in space, as shown in the error analysis, the agreement between the computed and exact solutions will be excellent. The attached data, which are associated with the four pole Lorentz dielectric and the five pole Debye medium, verify this assertion.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.376042","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/8577/00376042.pdf","startPage":"422","endPage":"426","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.376042","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8577","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Propagation in linear dispersive media: finite difference time-domain methodologies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376042","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376042/","displayDocTitle":"Propagation in linear dispersive media: finite difference time-domain methodologies","volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4930843","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Propagation in linear dispersive media: finite difference time-domain methodologies","sourcePdf":"00376042.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07267S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8577","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"104","articleId":"376042","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":376051,"authors":[{"name":"P.E.

It is argued that instead of trying to imitate the linear observer theory, the problem of constructing a nonlinear observer can be more fruitfully studied in the context of solving simultaneous nonlinear equations. In particular, it is shown that the discrete Newton method, properly interpreted, yields an asymptotic observer for a large class of discrete-time systems, while the continuous Newton method may be employed to obtain a global observer. Furthermore, it is analyzed how the use of Broyden's method in the observer structure affects the observer's performance and its computational complexity. An example illustrates some aspects of the proposed methods; moreover, it serves to show that these methods apply equally well to discrete-time systems and to continuous-time systems with sampled outputs.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376051/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"March 1995","accessionNumber":"4907102","volume":"40","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Observer design for nonlinear systems with discrete-time measurements","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Observer design for nonlinear systems with discrete-time measurements","sourcePdf":"00376051.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043905S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8578","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"244","articleId":"376051","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":376053,"authors":[{"name":"C.

During elevated intracranial pressure and intact regulation, positive pressure inhalation appears to briefly occlude venous flow into the cranial sinuses during inspiration. As a result, the intracranial pressure and arterial pressure signals are not similar. In contrast, when maximal dilation causes failure of regulation of cerebral blood flow, the intracranial pressure signal is approximately proportional to the arterial pressure signal. Comparison of the cross-correlation function derived from the intracranial and arterial pressure signals to the autocorrelation function of the arterial signal reveals that the two correlation functions are: (1) different during intact regulation and (2) nearly identical during dilation induced failure of regulation of cerebral blood flow.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.376137","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","startPage":"420","endPage":"424","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/8580/00376137.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.376137","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8580","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of loss of cerebral vascular tone by correlation of arterial and intracranial pressure signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cranial pressure","Animals","Blood flow","Blood pressure","Optical fibers","Skull","Laboratories","Autocorrelation","Brain injuries","Biomedical monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["blood pressure measurement","brain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cerebral vascular tone loss detection","arterial/intracranial pressure signals correlation","laboratory model","intact regulation conditions","cerebral blood flow","massive dilation","elevated intracranial pressure","positive pressure inhalation","briefly occluded venous flow","cranial sinuses","inspiration","cross-correlation function","autocorrelation function","severe head injury"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Animals","Blood Pressure","Cerebrovascular Circulation","Evaluation Studies as Topic","Homeostasis","Intracranial Pressure","Least-Squares Analysis","Monitoring, Physiologic","Pseudotumor Cerebri","Pseudotumor Cerebri","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Swine"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","displayDocTitle":"Detection of loss of cerebral vascular tone by correlation of arterial and intracranial pressure signals","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4925491","pubMedId":"7729842","publicationDate":"April 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376137/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of loss of cerebral vascular tone by correlation of arterial and intracranial pressure signals","sourcePdf":"00376137.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031299S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"33","articleId":"376137","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":376150,"authors":[{"name":"B.F.

A set of parallel stripes of alternating colors is projected onto the ulcerated skin and recorded by a CCD camera. The color, width, distance, and coding of the stripes have been adjusted to maximize the precision of the instrument. Algorithms have been developed to extract the stripes and determine their centers to better than 0.1 mm, even under circumstances where the skin reflectivity varies widely over short distances. A depth map for the ulcerated skin is calculated by triangulation. The volume of the ulcer is that sandwiched between the base of the lesion and the original healthy skin, which is simulated by a cubic spline interpolation between the surrounding areas of healthy skin. The instrument measures the ulcer's volume with a precision of about 5% provided the ratio of the ulcer's volume to area is greater than 0.4 cm. The technique has been used in hospital clinics for a wide variety of wounds.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.376150","startPage":"464","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.376150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8581","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/10/8581/00376150.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An instrument to measure the dimensions of skin wounds","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376150/","displayDocTitle":"An instrument to measure the dimensions of skin wounds","volume":"42","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4964026","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An instrument to measure the dimensions of skin wounds","sourcePdf":"00376150.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03248S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"45","articleId":"376150","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":376153,"authors":[{"name":"C.S.

It is now possible to add to these techniques the capability of automated medical diagnosis so that all data can be processed in an integrated environment. In this study, the parametric pattern recognition (PPR) algorithm that facilitates automatic MUAP feature extraction and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are combined for providing an integrated system for the diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders. Two paradigms of learning for training ANN models were investigated, supervised, and unsupervised. For supervised learning, the back-propagation algorithm and for unsupervised learning, the Kohonen's self-organizing feature maps algorithm were used. The diagnostic yield for models trained with both procedures was similar and on the order of 80%. However, back propagation models required considerably more computational effort compared to the Kohonen's self-organizing feature map models. Poorer diagnostic performance was obtained when the K-means nearest neighbor clustering algorithm was applied on the same set of data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.376153","pdfPath":"/iel1/10/8581/00376153.pdf","startPage":"486","endPage":"496","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.376153","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8581","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network models in EMG diagnosis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376153/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Neural network models in EMG diagnosis","volume":"42","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4964029","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network models in EMG diagnosis","sourcePdf":"00376153.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046067S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8581","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"94","articleId":"376153","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-04"},{"_id":376158,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

The computationally intensive step of this technique is the solution of a linear system of equations. Very large and very sparse system matrices result from large finite-element applications. The sparsity must be exploited for efficient use of memory and computational components in executing the solution step. In this paper we propose a scheme, called SPAR, for efficiently storing and performing computations on sparse matrices. SPAR consists of an alternate method of representing sparse matrices and an architecture that efficiently executes computations on the proposed data structure. The SPAR architecture has not been built, but we have constructed a register-transfer level simulator and executed the sparse matrix computations used with some large finite element applications. The simulation results demonstrate a 95% utilization of the floating-point units for some 3D applications. SPAR achieves high utilization of memory, memory bandwidth, and floating-point units when executing sparse matrix computations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.376168","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8582/00376168.pdf","startPage":"531","endPage":"545","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.376168","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8582","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SPAR: a new architecture for large finite element computations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376168/","displayDocTitle":"SPAR: a new architecture for large finite element computations","volume":"44","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4953422","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SPAR: a new architecture for large finite element computations","sourcePdf":"00376168.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039219S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"16","articleId":"376168","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":376169,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Previous works on buffer allocation are based either exclusively on the availability of buffers at runtime or on the access patterns of queries. In this paper, we first propose a unified approach for buffer allocation in which both of these considerations are taken into account. Our approach is based on the notion of marginal gains which specify the expected reduction in page faults by allocating extra buffers to a query. Then, we extend this approach to support adaptable buffer allocation. An adaptable buffer allocation algorithm automatically optimizes itself for the specific query workload. To achieve this adaptability, we propose using runtime information, such as the load of the system, in buffer allocation decisions. Our approach is to use a simple queuing model to predict whether a buffer allocation will improve the performance of the system. Thus, this paper provides a more theoretical basis for buffer allocation. Simulation results show that our methods based on marginal gains and our predictive methods consistently outperform existing allocation strategies. In addition, the predictive methods have the added advantage of adjusting their allocation to changing workloads.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.376169","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/8582/00376169.pdf","startPage":"546","endPage":"560","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.376169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8582","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Flexible and adaptable buffer management techniques for database management systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376169/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Flexible and adaptable buffer management techniques for database management systems","volume":"44","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4953423","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Flexible and adaptable buffer management techniques for database management systems","sourcePdf":"00376169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048837S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8582","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"25","articleId":"376169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":376175,"authors":[{"name":"Yuen-Hsien Tseng","affiliation":["Republic of China Army, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Yuen-Hsien Tseng","id":"37087355584"},{"name":"Ja-Ling Wu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ja-Ling Wu","id":"37087155843"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"376175","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376175","abstract":"A nearly cost-optimal winner-take-all (WTA) neural network derived from a constant-time sorting network is presented.

Among the two formulations, one is an implicit unconditionally stable scheme, whereas the other is an explicit scheme which does not involve matrix inversions. Although the implicit scheme results in worse computational complexity, it is extremely appealing for modeling EM problems with fine features. This is because the time step used in the algorithm is determined by accuracy not by stability. Furthermore, we also present in this paper stability analysis using the Z-transform, computational complexity, and several numerical results for the implicit algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.376272","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8584/00376272.pdf","startPage":"1325","endPage":"1329","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.376272","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Whitney elements time domain (WETD) methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376272","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376272/","displayDocTitle":"Whitney elements time domain (WETD) methods","volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4936008","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Whitney elements time domain (WETD) methods","sourcePdf":"00376272.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029194S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"77","articleId":"376272","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":376273,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Calculated results by this technique agree well with the measured ones, so that the utility of this technique is confirmed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8584/00376367.pdf","startPage":"1722","endPage":"1724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doi":"10.1109/20.376367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.376367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8584","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A proposal for rotating machineries analysis by considering the unknown equal potential condition on FEM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Proposals","Machinery","Finite element methods","Magnetic analysis","Magnetic separation","Magnetic fields","DC machines","Costs","Integral equations","Servomotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","magnetic fields","matrix algebra","machine theory","brushless DC motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rotating machinery analysis","unknown equal potential condition","FEM","magnetic field analysis","finite element method","rotatory movement","brushless DC machines"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"A proposal for rotating machineries analysis by considering the unknown equal potential condition on FEM","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4942587","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A proposal for rotating machineries analysis by considering the unknown equal potential condition on FEM","sourcePdf":"00376367.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04423S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"7","articleId":"376367","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":376371,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A certain arrangement was devised that should reduce the extension of the far ranging stray field. Hence, a second solenoid was placed outside the SMES device with a current flowing in the opposite direction compared to the inner coil. Configurations with both coils in a single plane were regarded only. As an important factor the minimum energy to be stored was given. In a first step calculation, methods have been found that reveal data for the minimum geometrical dimensions of the SMES device in an analytical way. It was shown that the stray field, compared to a single coil arrangement could be reduced remarkably.

Various techniques of optimization are used in NDT. In this work, the artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied with NDT to identify a crack in a conducting medium. In general, deterministic techniques are used with the back propagation algorithm (BP) to train the neural networks. The ANNs which are trained by a deterministic method have a tendency to get trapped in local minima. In this paper a stochastic version of the gradient descent is applied to train the ANNs and it overcomes the difficulties-of local minima caused by the sinusoidal fields. The stochastic version used in this approach is based on the Metropolis algorithm which is frequently used in the simulated annealing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376431/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4953467","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"31","issue":"3","displayDocTitle":"NDT identification of a crack using ANNs with stochastic gradient descent","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NDT identification of a crack using ANNs with stochastic gradient descent","sourcePdf":"376431.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.030886S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","articleId":"376431","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":376437,"authors":[{"name":"G.F.

As opposed to classical models of magnetic circuits, today, gradient techniques for mathematical optimization have been proposed and are used. These techniques, while being expensive, are exact. More recently, artificial neural networks have been suggested, but they, work best only if the data set of parameter-set, performance pairs for training the network is close to the optimal solution that we seek. In this paper, it is shown how all three methods may be used in concert to increase efficiency. The circuit model is used to generate an approximate inverse solution. Then direct finite element solutions are used to generate the required training set and this is used with the neural network to get a better solution. This solution is finally used as a starting point for the gradient optimization scheme which converges quickly because the starting point is close to the actual solution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.376439","startPage":"2016","endPage":"2019","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8584/00376439.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.376439","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of electromagnetic devices: circuit models, neural networks and gradient methods in concert","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optimization methods","Electromagnetic devices","Circuits","Electromagnetic modeling","Neural networks","Gradient methods","Intelligent networks","Finite element methods","Stochastic processes","Design optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["conjugate gradient methods","neural nets","equivalent circuits","electromagnetic devices","electromagnetism"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic devices","circuit models","neural networks","gradient methods","approximate inverse solution","direct finite element solutions","training set","EM devices","mathematical optimization"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of electromagnetic devices: circuit models, neural networks and gradient methods in concert","volume":"31","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4953475","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of electromagnetic devices: circuit models, neural networks and gradient methods in concert","sourcePdf":"00376439.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064526S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"12","articleId":"376439","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":376445,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The waveform of the interfering current assumed is taken from the draft of the CENELEC ESD Standard. The distribution of the current density into the enclosure during the electrostatic discharge event is deduced by means of a scalar magnetic potential approach in the frequency domain, and by a consequent finite difference discretization. The passages from the frequency domain to the time domain and forward are made using the discrete Fourier transform. This formulation of the problem allows the simulation grid to be reduced to only the metallic enclosure, saving time either in preparation of the input data or in the numerical computation. The electromagnetic interferences radiated by the enclosure during the electrostatic discharge event are directly computed by a multipole expansion of the resulting current density distribution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.376450","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8584/00376450.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.376450","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8584","startPage":"2064","endPage":"2067","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) modelling of EMI by ESD","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376450","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) modelling of EMI by ESD","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376450/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4953485","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-difference frequency-domain (FDFD) modelling of EMI by ESD","sourcePdf":"00376450.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060308S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"6","articleId":"376450","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":376457,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The proposed method can be applied to both power overhead conductors and those buried in a conducting environment. The paper presents a direct application for this concept which consists in calculating the electromagnetic fields created by a substation grounding system following an accidental short circuit or a lightning stroke. The finite element method (FEM) with several formulations is used. Currents in the cylindrical conductors which make up the earth network grid are taken into account without volume meshing; simple line discretization of these is carried out. Electromagnetic fields generated by leakage currents and currents induced underground are taken into account. Furthermore, open boundaries of both air and earth environments are processed by introducing a spatial transformation. This application for an earth network enables to show the advantages of FEM processing compared with the method traditionally used in antenna theory for this kind of problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/20.376472","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Magnetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/20/8584/00376472.pdf","startPage":"2150","endPage":"2153","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/20.376472","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8584","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A finite element method for calculating the electromagnetic fields generated by substation grounding systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376472","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376472/","displayDocTitle":"A finite element method for calculating the electromagnetic fields generated by substation grounding systems","volume":"31","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4953506","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A finite element method for calculating the electromagnetic fields generated by substation grounding systems","sourcePdf":"00376472.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040206S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8584","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"20","citationCount":"40","articleId":"376472","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":376478,"authors":[{"name":"V.

This work is motivated by the fact that sensor data fusion is an effective means of reducing uncertainties in sensor observations, and that the combined uncertainty varies with the relative placement of the sensors with respect to each other. The problem of optimal sensor placement is formulated and a solution is presented in two dimensional space. The algebraic structure of the combined sensor uncertainty with respect to the placement of sensors is studied. A necessary condition for optimal placement is derived and this necessary condition is used to obtain an efficient closed-form solution for the global optimal placement.

The degree of support is defined as a function of the distance between the two vectors. The evidence of the k nearest neighbors is then pooled by means of Dempster's rule of combination. This approach provides a global treatment of such issues as ambiguity and distance rejection, and imperfect knowledge regarding the class membership of training patterns.

By using the method of least-squares, the authors translate the empirical data into the form of the control points of B-spline curves to construct fuzzy membership functions. This unified form of fuzzy membership functions is called a B-spline membership function (BMF). By using the local control property of a B-spline curve, the BMFs can be tuned locally during the learning process. For the control of a model car through fuzzy-neural networks, it is shown that the local tuning of BMFs can indeed reduce the number of iterations tremendously. This fuzzy-neural control of a model car is presented to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/8585/00376496.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"851","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/21.376496","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.376496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8585","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376496","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy B-spline membership function (BMF) and its applications in fuzzy-neural control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Spline","Fuzzy set theory","Fuzzy neural networks","Automatic control","Process control","Set theory","Uncertainty","System identification","Construction industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy set theory","fuzzy control","neurocontrollers","fuzzy neural nets","splines (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy B-spline membership function","fuzzy-neural control","fuzzy membership functions","least-squares","local control property","learning process","model car","fuzzy-neural networks","local tuning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May 1995","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy B-spline membership function (BMF) and its applications in fuzzy-neural control","volume":"25","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","accessionNumber":"4942681","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy B-spline membership function (BMF) and its applications in fuzzy-neural control","sourcePdf":"00376496.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049049S","chronDate":"May 1995","isNumber":"8585","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"118","articleId":"376496","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":376523,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Expansion is achieved by adding new communication links and computer nodes such that reliability measures of the network are optimized within specified constraints. A genetic algorithm-based computer network expansion methodology (GANE) is developed to optimize a specified objective function (reliability measure) under a given set of network constraints. This technique is very powerful because the same approach can be extended to solve different types of problems; the only modification required is the objective function evaluation module. The versatility of the genetic algorithm is illustrated by applying it to solve various network expansion problems (optimize diameter, average distance and computer network reliability for network expansion). The results are compared with the optimal solutions computed using an exhaustive search of complete solution space. The results demonstrate that GANE is very effective (in both accuracy and computation time) and applies to a wide range of problems, but it does not guarantee the optimal results for every problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376523/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4925466","volume":"44","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Genetic-algorithm-based reliability optimization for computer network expansion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic-algorithm-based reliability optimization for computer network expansion","sourcePdf":"00376523.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055552S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"31","articleId":"376523","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":376535,"authors":[{"name":"L.A.

Originally suggested by Barlow and Heidtmann (1984), generating functions provide a clear, concise method for computing the reliabilities of such systems. By recursively applying the FFT to computing generator function products, the RAFFT-GFP achieves an overall asymptotic computational complexity of O(n/spl middot/(log/sub 2/(n))/sup 2/) for computing system reliability. Algebraic manipulations suggested by Upadhyaya and Pham (1993) are reformulated in the context of generator functions to reduce the number of computations. The number of computations and the CPU time are used to compare the performance of the RAFFT-GFP algorithm to the best found in the literature. Due to larger overheads required, the RAFFT-GFP algorithm is superior for problem sizes larger than about 4000 components, in terms of both computation and CPU time for the examples studied in this paper. Lastly, studies of very large systems with unequal reliabilities indicate that the binomial distribution gives a good approximation for generating function coefficients, allowing algebraic solutions for system reliability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/24.376535","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.376535","startPage":"132","endPage":"136","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/8586/00376535.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An O(n/spl middot/(log/sub 2/(n))/sup 2/) algorithm for computing the reliability of k-out-of-n:G and k-to-l-out-of-n:G systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar 1995","displayDocTitle":"An O(n/spl middot/(log/sub 2/(n))/sup 2/) algorithm for computing the reliability of k-out-of-n:G and k-to-l-out-of-n:G systems","publicationDate":"March 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"44","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4925475","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376535/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An O(n/spl middot/(log/sub 2/(n))/sup 2/) algorithm for computing the reliability of k-out-of-n:G and k-to-l-out-of-n:G systems","sourcePdf":"00376535.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.02743S","chronDate":"Mar 1995","isNumber":"8586","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"3","articleId":"376535","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":376616,"authors":[{"name":"E.J.

Backscattering data from complex objects and seabottom were generated using a Universal High Resolution Imaging Sonar Simulation Toolkit (UHRISST) developed by the authors. Our approach here involves the approximation of objects and the sea-bottom through a series of facets that are small compared to the wavelength. The Target Strength of standard objects like the sphere, cylinder, and cone predicted by our model have been compared with various high frequency approximation formulations and produced a good fit. For the prediction of the backscattering strength from the sea-bottom, we have taken into account most of the small-scale features that represent the sand grain properties, intermediate features that represent seabottom roughness and large features that block propagation. Sea-bottom backscattering predictions made using this model were compared with high frequency scattering strength values measured off Panama City, FL, USA, and produced a moderate fit. Nonparametric statistical analysis was carried out on the bottom backscattering signals from a flat isotropic sea-bottom. The probability distribution function and probability of false alarm function of the bottom backscattering data was measured and found to largely follow the normal distribution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/48.376675","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8591","startPage":"119","endPage":"130","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel1/48/8591/00376675.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simulation of backscattering of high frequency sound from complex objects and sand sea-bottom","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376675/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Simulation of backscattering of high frequency sound from complex objects and sand sea-bottom","publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4942707","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"20","issue":"2","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simulation of backscattering of high frequency sound from complex objects and sand sea-bottom","sourcePdf":"00376675.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.04412S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8591","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"48","citationCount":"33","articleId":"376675","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":376752,"authors":[{"name":"V.X.

The study aimed at decreasing the input size to the ANN detector, without decreasing the information content of the signal and degrading the detection performance. Since routine clinical EEG requires recordings from many channels (generally 32 or 64), input size becomes a critical design parameter for real-time multichannel spike detection systems. For a sliding window of 20 points, more than 600 input lines will be necessary for a 32-channel system, which is not easily manageable with current ANN technology. One approach to this problem is to use a single ANN module for each EEG channel and integrate the outputs across channel information with a second module. The authors have successfully developed a 16 channel prototype of such a system working in real-time. This system used a 20 point (100 ms) sliding time window and employed a floating point digital signal processor for real-time operation. Adding more channels to this system would be difficult for real-time operation. In addition, the authors' recent studies showed that the best detection performance is attained with a 30 point (150 ms) time window, further increasing the computational load. Thus, the development of a preprocessor to reduce the input size without significantly reducing the information content would be very helpful in developing large multichannel EEG spike detection systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/51.376754","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/8594/00376754.pdf","startPage":"160","endPage":"166","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.376754","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet preprocessing for automated neural network detection of EEG spikes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376754","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376754/","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet preprocessing for automated neural network detection of EEG spikes","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 1995","accessionNumber":"4930362","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet preprocessing for automated neural network detection of EEG spikes","sourcePdf":"00376754.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029596S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1995","isNumber":"8594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"174","articleId":"376754","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":376755,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This work leads also, for the problem at hand, to the identification of the most relevant resolution levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/51.376755","publicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/51/8594/00376755.pdf","startPage":"167","endPage":"173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/51.376755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8594","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing wavelet transforms for recognizing cardiac patterns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376755","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Mar/Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Mar/Apr 1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376755/","displayDocTitle":"Comparing wavelet transforms for recognizing cardiac patterns","volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"March-April 1995","accessionNumber":"4930363","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparing wavelet transforms for recognizing cardiac patterns","sourcePdf":"00376755.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105213S","chronDate":"Mar/Apr 1995","isNumber":"8594","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"51","citationCount":"131","articleId":"376755","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":376801,"authors":[{"name":"A.

When operating a Mach-Zehnder electro-optic modulator at the appropriate bias point the carrier exits one of the output ports while the information carrying sidebands exit the other output port. The absence of a strong carrier component in the DSBSC output allows the use of an optical amplifier immediately following the modulator where the light signals are still relatively strong hence preserving the high S/N. In our experiments using heterodyne detection at 1319 nm, we show a -28-dB carrier suppression using a commercial M-Z modulator.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376826/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"April  1995","volume":"7","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4937365","publicationDate":"April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A novel technique for double sideband suppressed carrier modulation of optical fields","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel technique for double sideband suppressed carrier modulation of optical fields","sourcePdf":"00376826.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032861S","chronDate":"April  1995","isNumber":"8596","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"66","articleId":"376826","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Letter","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":376837,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Joon Lim","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"lastName":"Teng Joon Lim","id":"37087838072"},{"name":"M.D. Macleod","affiliation":["Engineering Department, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK"],"firstName":"M.D.","lastName":"Macleod","id":"37279070600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"376837","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive algorithm","Delay effects","Delay estimation","IIR filters","Filtering algorithms","Recursive estimation","Adaptive filters","Interpolation","Lattices","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","adaptive filters","IIR filters","filtering theory","delays","interpolation","lattice filters","convergence of numerical methods","tracking filters","adaptive estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient-based algorithms","adaptive time delay estimation","IIR filtering","recursive identification","long pure delays","IIR filter coefficients","gradient-descent methods","interpolation","input sequence","direct form filter parametrization","normalized lattice filter","computer simulations","convergence","tracking properties","adaptive algorithms"]}],"abstract":"A new class of gradient-based algorithms for joint adaptive time delay estimation and IIR filtering for the recursive identification of systems with long pure delays is introduced.

A maximum likelihood estimation algorithm is derived for estimating the AR parameters by solving a generalized normal equation, and a clustering algorithm is used for estimating the parameters of Gaussian mixture density of the source signals. The correlation matrix of the generalized normal equation is not Toeplitz but is symmetric and in general positive definite. Higher order statistics of skewness and kurtosis are used for identifying the source distribution as being Gaussian or non-Gaussian and, consequently, determining the parameter estimation technique between the conventional method and the proposed method. Experiments on non-Gaussian source AR processes demonstrate that under high SNR conditions (SNR/spl ges/20 dB), the proposed algorithm outperforms the conventional AR estimation algorithm and the cumulant-based algorithm by an order-of-magnitude reduction of average estimation errors. The proposed algorithm also has very low estimation errors with short data records. Finally, a maximum likelihood prediction method is formulated for non-Gaussian source AR processes that has shown potential in achieving higher efficiency signal coding than linear predictive coding.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8597/00376842.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"903","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/78.376842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.376842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8597","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376842","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gaussian mixture density modeling of non-Gaussian source for autoregressive process","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parameter estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Clustering algorithms","Equations","Estimation error","Probability distribution","Symmetric matrices","Higher order statistics","Prediction methods","Signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive processes","Gaussian processes","Gaussian distribution","maximum likelihood estimation","higher order statistics","correlation methods","matrix algebra","prediction theory","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["non-Gaussian source","autoregressive process","Gaussian mixture density modeling","probability distributions","maximum likelihood estimation algorithm","AR parameters estimation","generalized normal equation","clustering algorithm","source signals","correlation matrix","positive definite symmetric matrix","higher order statistics","high SNR","average estimation errors","maximum likelihood prediction method","signal coding","Gaussian distribution"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"Gaussian mixture density modeling of non-Gaussian source for autoregressive process","volume":"43","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"April 1995","accessionNumber":"4937755","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gaussian mixture density modeling of non-Gaussian source for autoregressive process","sourcePdf":"00376842.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075284S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"41","articleId":"376842","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":376844,"authors":[{"name":"B.

It is desirable that the boundary conditions reduce edge effects and define a transformation into a space having the same dimensionality as the original signal. The complication that arises is in the computation of the inverse transform. Although it is straightforward to reconstruct the signal values that were not influenced by the boundary conditions, recovering those values on the boundaries is nontrivial. The solution of this problem is discussed for general linear boundary conditions. No symmetry assumptions are made on the boundary conditions or on the impulse responses of the analysis filters. A low-rank linear transform is derived that expresses the boundary values in terms of the transform coefficients, which in turn provides a method for inverting the subband decomposition. The application of the results in the case of two-channel orthonormal wavelet filters is discussed, and the effects of the filter support on the conditioning of the inverse problem are investigated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel bank filters","Boundary conditions","Image reconstruction","Filter bank","Image analysis","Signal synthesis","Signal analysis","Inverse problems","Performance analysis","Transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","image coding","image reconstruction","image sampling","wavelet transforms","filtering theory","boundary-value problems","inverse problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["critically sampled filter banks","linear boundary conditions","perfect reconstruction","finite discrete-time signal","signal processing","edge effects","inverse transform","signal reconstruction","impulse response","analysis filters","low-rank linear transform","transform coefficients","subband decomposition","two-channel orthonormal wavelet filters","subband image coding systems","inverse problem","image reconstruction","image boundaries"]}],"doi":"10.1109/78.376853","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/78/8597/00376853.pdf","startPage":"994","endPage":"997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8597","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/78.376853","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Perfect reconstruction with critically sampled filter banks and linear boundary conditions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=376853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Perfect reconstruction with critically sampled filter banks and linear boundary conditions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/376853/","volume":"43","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4937765","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Perfect reconstruction with critically sampled filter banks and linear boundary conditions","sourcePdf":"00376853.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026914S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8597","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"8","articleId":"376853","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":376856,"authors":[{"name":"C.D.

This paper deals with a 16 poles axial-flux PM motor prototype which is used in the propulsion drive of an electrical scooter. The motor prototype has 45 Nm peak torque, 6.8 kg active materials weight, and is coupled directly to the scooter rear wheel.

The various approximations and simplifications used in the development of the analytical design equations are justified using results obtained from a detailed computer model of the SRM and by using experimental results from a high power density SRM designed for an aircraft engine fuel pumping application. Comparisons of predicted and measured machine performance parameters for this 90 kW 25000 RPM machine, such as flux linkage curves, back EMF, electromechanical power converted, and inverter volt-ampere requirements are presented. It is also shown that there exists a fundamental maximum torque density that is attainable with the SRM and an estimate of this maximum torque density limit is given. The power factor for a SRM is defined and the machine parameters that determine its value are presented. This power factor is compared to the similarly defined power factor for an AC machine and found to be smaller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8608/00377482.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"297 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.377482","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.377482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8608","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=377482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design considerations for the switched reluctance motor","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Reluctance machines","Reactive power","Torque","Performance analysis","Differential equations","Aircraft propulsion","Fuels","Pumps","Application software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reluctance motors","switching circuits","electric machine analysis computing","simulation","power conversion","aerospace propulsion","aircraft","pumps","aerospace engines","invertors","torque","power factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["switched reluctance motor","computer model","high power density","aircraft engine fuel pump","machine performance parameters","flux linkage curves","back EMF","electromechanical power conversion","inverter volt-ampere requirements","maximum torque density","power factor","machine parameters","90 kW"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Design considerations for the switched reluctance motor","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4846560","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design considerations for the switched reluctance motor","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00377482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034703S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"17","articleId":"377482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":377484,"authors":[{"name":"Yuefeng Liao","affiliation":["Advanced Motor Development Center, Emerson Motor Company, Saint Louis, MO, USA"],"lastName":"Yuefeng Liao","id":"37087599592"},{"name":"Li Zhen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Li Zhen","id":"37086977874"},{"name":"Longya Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"lastName":"Longya Xu","id":"37087151288"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1993-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"377484","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reluctance motors","Variable speed drives","Costs","Induction motors","Synchronous motors","Machine windings","Sensorless control","Power generation economics","Reluctance machines","Prototypes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reluctance motor drives","variable speed drives","machine theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doubly-fed reluctance motor","adjustable speed drives","steady-state performance analysis","linear model","magnetic nonlinearities","induction motor","2 hp"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=377484","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a doubly-fed reluctance motor for adjustable speed drives","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.377484","startPage":"305","endPage":"312 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8608/00377484.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.377484","abstract":"A methodology for steady-state performance analysis and design of the doubly-fed reluctance motor (DFRM) is presented in this paper.

The problem with high voltage stress in the conventional inverter is resolved, while its ruggedness, reliability and high power handling capability are preserved. The device voltage stress can be reduced from 2 per unit to 1.1-1.3 per unit, and PWM operation and link resonance control become easily fulfilled. Analysis and simulation have demonstrated the successful operation of the new topology. The introduction of the auxiliary switched inductor circuit is also well justified by its requirement of components with low stresses and ratings. Application of the quasi-resonant inverter is aimed at those requiring high power, high efficiency, low EMI and a high quality spectrum.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonance","Resonant inverters","Pulse width modulation inverters","Inductors","Pulse width modulation","Switching converters","Topology","Stress control","Voltage control","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant power convertors","PWM power convertors","PWM invertors","switching circuits","network analysis","network topology","power inductors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-resonant DC link inverter","passive clamping","switched inductor","power converter topology","voltage stress","ruggedness","reliability","power handling capability","PWM operation","link resonance control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.377516","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8608/00377516.pdf","startPage":"841","endPage":"848 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8608","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.377516","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A passively clamped quasi resonant DC link inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=377516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A passively clamped quasi resonant DC link inverter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377516/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864783","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A passively clamped quasi resonant DC link inverter","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00377516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034548S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"9","articleId":"377516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":377519,"authors":[{"name":"M.C.

The control scheme employs an inner capacitor current feedback loop and an outer capacitor voltage control loop to ensure that the harmonic content of both the capacitor voltage and utility current is within the acceptable total harmonic distortion. The utility interface system is analyzed by establishing a general model using state-space analysis. Employing the concept of state-space averaging technique, the steady-state performance of a balanced three-phase system is obtained in terms of system parameters. The dynamic response of the control strategy is then examined by developing a linearized model of the system equations employing perturbation technique and small signal approximation. Based on the bode plot of the system transfer function, a control loop regulator is selected to improve the dynamic response of the system. It is shown in the paper that the proposed scheme offers many advantages for utility interface systems; it is robust and insensitive to parameter variations. In addition, due to the use of the inner current loop, the system has fast dynamic response. Moreover, it is compatible with both large and weak AC network applications and capable of feeding the utility current at any desired power factor.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.377524","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8608/00377524.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.377524","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8608","startPage":"895","endPage":"902 vol.2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and analysis of a feedback control strategy for three-phase voltage-source utility interface systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=377524","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and analysis of a feedback control strategy for three-phase voltage-source utility interface systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377524/","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864790","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and analysis of a feedback control strategy for three-phase voltage-source utility interface systems","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00377524.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048537S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"15","articleId":"377524","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":377528,"authors":[{"name":"C.

This paper deals with the comparisons between two systems, SB and MB at a multi-10 MVA GTO power converter for reactive power compensation from the viewpoints of desired switching frequency and converter connections. SB is a single bridge system consisting of a three-phase bridge power converter unit and a transformer and its PWM frequency varies from 450 Hz to 1800 Hz. The line frequency is 50 Hz. 1 MB or 3 MB is a multiple bridge system consisting of plural single- or three-phase power converter units and transformers. Two kinds of systems using different transformer windings are considered. Type A uses conventional but complicated zigzag windings and type B simple star and delta windings. The switching frequencies are chosen the lowest, 50 Hz for 1 MB and 150 Hz for 3 MB. The evaluated items are harmonic distortion, power loss, GTO utilization factor and control response. A simulation study shows that MB is superior to SB in any case, even in the case of severe line faults where very quick response is requested. A new control strategy is adopted for obtaining quick response. Type B system has almost the same characteristics as type A system and can easily conquer the DC magnetization of the power converter transformers that may be encountered at a line voltage disturbance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.377532","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8608/00377532.pdf","startPage":"946","endPage":"953 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.377532","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Which is better at a high power reactive power compensation system, high PWM frequency or multiple connection?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=377532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377532/","displayDocTitle":"Which is better at a high power reactive power compensation system, high PWM frequency or multiple connection?","volume":"2","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864797","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Which is better at a high power reactive power compensation system, high PWM frequency or multiple connection?","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00377532.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033127S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"26","articleId":"377532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":377537,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Woo Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Jong-Woo Choi","id":"37087262678"},{"name":"Seung-Ki Sul","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea"],"lastName":"Seung-Ki Sul","id":"37086965531"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"0-7803-1993-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"377537","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1006},"abstract":"In voltage-fed PWM inverters, the relation between the reference voltage and the output voltage is nonlinear due to the dead time effect and the voltage drop of the switching devices.

Although the presence of a purely capacitive snubber across each power device allows true PWM in such converters, the switching sequence constraints due to the load current vector may result in a ripple content much higher than that obtained from conventional PWM schemes with the same switching frequency. However, it is also shown that the location and duration of the zero-vector state is a degree of freedom which can be useful to obtain different switching sequences, so reducing the ripple substantially. The above criteria have been adopted in developing a PWM technique based on space vectors, which is also described in the paper. Such a technique determines the optimum vector sequence which gives the required voltage vector, while reducing the ripple content. Results of simulations are reported, illustrating the differences between the various schemes and validating the effectiveness of the proposed modulation method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.377569","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.377569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8608","startPage":"1122","endPage":"1129 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8608/00377569.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=377569","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation inverters","Pulse width modulation converters","Voltage","Resonance","Pulse width modulation","Resonant inverters","Snubbers","Switching converters","Switching frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resonant power convertors","switching circuits","PWM power convertors","voltage control","electric current control","power system harmonics","simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["space vector control","current harmonics","quasi-resonant soft-switching PWM conversion","capacitive snubber","switching sequence constraints","load current vector","ripple content","zero-vector state","ripple reduction","optimum vector sequence","voltage vector","simulations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Space vector control and current harmonics in quasi-resonant soft-switching PWM conversion","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864820","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377569/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space vector control and current harmonics in quasi-resonant soft-switching PWM conversion","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00377569.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032217S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"5","articleId":"377569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":377571,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The work is motivated by the need for active filtration in a current-source excitation system for a variable-reluctance generator. The active filter is comprised of a six switch three-phase inverter, a DC bus capacitor, and an isolation transformer. The isolation transformer is required by the application. The leakage inductance associated with each phase of the isolation transformer is used as the series impedance with each phase, by which the inverter is able to actively shape the phase currents in order to compensate for the nonlinearities of all loads within the point of common coupling. The active filter is controlled through two control loops. The inner current regulation loop uses sliding-mode control by virtue of its ease of implementation. The outer voltage loop regulates the average voltage on the DC bus capacitor. The outer voltage loop is responsible for correctly setting the commanded magnitude of the phase currents. This paper presents the analysis, design and operation of the active filter.

Computer simulation and experimental results verify that the proposed PWM control scheme is suitable for high power and high voltage three-level GTO inverters applied to induction motor drives.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/1135/8608/00377573.pdf","startPage":"1151","endPage":"1157 vol.2","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1994.377573","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1994.377573","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8608","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=377573","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel PWM scheme for a three-level voltage source inverter with GTO thyristors","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation inverters","Thyristors","Pulse width modulation","Capacitors","Zero voltage switching","Space vector pulse width modulation","Topology","Diodes","Computer simulation","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PWM invertors","PWM power convertors","thyristor convertors","induction motor drives","switching circuits","power capacitors","power system harmonics","voltage control","circuit analysis computing","circuit testing","power engineering computing","control system analysis computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-level voltage source inverter","GTO thyristors","PWM VSI","space voltage vectors","harmonic components","output voltage","voltage balancing","DC link capacitors","voltage vector selection procedure","computer simulation","experiments","induction motor drives"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377573/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"A novel PWM scheme for a three-level voltage source inverter with GTO thyristors","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4864824","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel PWM scheme for a three-level voltage source inverter with GTO thyristors","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00377573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03692S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"9","articleId":"377573","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":377662,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In particular, the indirect method of FOC is the most practical scheme since it does not require the measurement of magnetic fluxes within the machine, and consequently standard machines may be used. A typical FOC system contains high bandwidth current control loops which require fast and complex signal processing which is difficult to achieve using conventional analogue methods; however, high speed microprocessors offer an alternative. Nevertheless, the FOC algorithm is computationally intensive and consequently several microprocessor/digital controller solutions have been proposed in an effort to achieve the necessary processing requirements. This paper describes the implementation of an FOC digital controller for an induction machine utilising a single transputer and a high performance I/O system, with current loop sampling rates in the region of 10 kHz.

Most modern microprocessors are stretched to the limit to perform all the required calculations within the short sample times required for such applications as the control of AC machines with neural networks. Microprocessors such as the Texas Instruments C40 and the Inmos transputer family provide the option of using parallelism so as to share the computational load amongst a number of processors. However, efficient programming of multirate algorithms on parallel processor networks is a complicated task which entails combinatorial optimisation. This paper reports on the development of a general scheduling tool which is used to implement complex control algorithms on parallel processors by merely drawing the required block diagram with standard schematic software. The scheduling tool then provides accurate estimates of the sampling times achievable for a given algorithm and also generates the required C language code. Results of this scheduling tool are presented showing time-space graphs (Gantt charts) for typical control algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377685/","accessionNumber":"4858912","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-6 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimising multirate motion control algorithms on parallel processors by static scheduling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimising multirate motion control algorithms on parallel processors by static scheduling","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00377685.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043396S","chronDate":"2-6 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8608","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"1135","citationCount":"4","articleId":"377685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":377699,"authors":[{"name":"L.

Furthermore, for longer intervals (tens of nanoseconds), a typical peak error of 3 picoseconds has been demonstrated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time measurement","Oscillators","Timing","Sampling methods","Oscilloscopes","Accuracy","Delay effects","Character generation","Bandwidth","Counting circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time measurement","oscilloscopes","time bases","measurement errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["picosecond time interval measurements","time interval measurements","repeatability","time interval measurement","subpicosecond repeatability","rise time measurement","step generators","20 ps"]}],"doi":"10.1109/19.377832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","pdfPath":"/iel1/19/8609/00377832.pdf","startPage":"284","endPage":"287","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8609","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/19.377832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Picosecond time interval measurements","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=377832","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Picosecond time interval measurements","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377832/","volume":"44","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4953381","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Picosecond time interval measurements","sourcePdf":"00377832.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032964S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8609","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"19","citationCount":"22","articleId":"377832","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":377847,"authors":[{"name":"G.L.

The system consists of only feedforward neural networks, allowing efficient parallel implementation. The most time and data-consuming stage, learning the relevant features, is wholly unsupervised and can be made off-line. The consequent supervised stage where the object classes are learned is simple and fast. The feature extraction is based on distortion tolerant Gabor transformations, followed by minimum distortion clustering by multilayer self-organizing maps. Due to the unsupervised learning strategy, there is no need for preclassified training samples or other explicit selection for training patterns during the training, which allows a large amount of training material to be used at the early stages, A supervised, one-layer subspace network classifier on top of the feature extractor is used for object labeling. The system has been trained with natural images giving the relevant features, and human faces and their parts have been used as the object classes for testing. The current experiments indicate that the feature space has sufficient resolution power for a moderate number of classes with rather strong distortions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","volume":"6","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4960396","pubMedId":"18263341","displayDocTitle":"Distortion tolerant pattern recognition based on self-organizing feature extraction","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion tolerant pattern recognition based on self-organizing feature extraction","sourcePdf":"00377961.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.033863S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"61","articleId":"377961","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":377962,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Kraaijveld","affiliation":["Pattern Recognition Group, Department of Applied Physics, Delft University of Technnology, Delft, Netherlands"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Kraaijveld","id":"37373712300"},{"name":"J.

Then the interpoint distances in the feature space between the units in the network are graphically displayed to show the underlying structure of the data. Furthermore, we present and discuss a new method to quantify how well a topology preserving mapping algorithm maps the high-dimensional input data onto the network structure. This is used to compare our projection method with a well-known method of Sammon (1969). Experiments indicate that the performance of the Kohonen projection method is comparable or better than Sammon's method for the purpose of classifying clustered data. Its time-complexity only depends on the resolution of the output image, and not on the size of the dataset. A disadvantage, however, is the large amount of CPU time required.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.377962","startPage":"548","endPage":"559","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8611/00377962.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.377962","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A nonlinear projection method based on Kohonen's topology preserving maps","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data analysis","Pattern recognition","Computer science","Network topology","Inspection","Thyristors","Physics","Computer displays","Data visualization","Projection algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["self-organising feature maps","topology","image classification","unsupervised learning","iterative methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear projection method","Kohonen topology preserving maps","2D images","interpoint distances","feature space","2D network structure","time-complexity","output image resolution","iterative method","unsupervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377962/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"A nonlinear projection method based on Kohonen's topology preserving maps","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4960397","pubMedId":"18263342","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A nonlinear projection method based on Kohonen's topology preserving maps","sourcePdf":"00377962.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036151S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"140","articleId":"377962","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":377963,"authors":[{"name":"P.

In this paper we propose two new classes of supervised learning algorithms for feedforward, binary-output neural network structures whose objective is hypothesis testing. All the algorithms are applications of stochastic approximation and are guaranteed to provide optimization with probability one. The first class of algorithms follows the Neyman-Pearson approach and maximizes the probability of detection, subject to a given false alarm constraint. These algorithms produce layer-by-layer optimal Neyman-Pearson designs. The second class of algorithms minimizes the probability of error and leads to layer-by-layer Bayes optimal designs. Deviating from the layer-by-layer optimization assumption, we propose more powerful learning techniques which unify, in some sense, the already existing algorithms. The proposed algorithms were implemented and tested on a simulated hypothesis testing problem.

This network provides a more efficient and regular architecture compared to ordinary higher-order feedforward networks while maintaining their fast learning property. The ridge polynomial network is a generalization of the pi-sigma network and uses a special form of ridge polynomials. It is shown that any multivariate polynomial can be represented in this form, and realized by an RPN. Approximation capability of the RPN's is shown by this representation theorem and the Weierstrass polynomial approximation theorem. The RPN provides a natural mechanism for incremental network growth. Simulation results on a surface fitting problem, the classification of high-dimensional data and the realization of a multivariate polynomial function are given to highlight the capability of the network.

It transforms the system response, usually some occasionally provided reinforcement signal, into organized useful information. Based on the knowledge developed in the critic module, the action module learns the control technique. One difficulty in using this scheme lies on selection of learning parameters. In our previous study on the CMAC-based scheme, the best set of learning parameters were selected from a large number of test simulations. The picked parameter values are not necessarily adequate for generic cases. A general guideline for parameter selection needs to be developed. In this study, the problem is investigated.

A neural learning technique that satisfies these requirements, without sacrificing the benefits of distributed representations, is presented. It relies on a formalization of the problem as the minimization of the error over the previously learned input-output patterns, subject to the constraint of perfect encoding of the new pattern. Then this constrained optimization problem is transformed into an unconstrained one with hidden-unit activations as variables. This new formulation leads to an algorithm for solving the problem, which we call learning with minimal degradation (LMD). Some experimental comparisons of the performance of LMD with backpropagation are provided which, besides showing the advantages of using LMD, reveal the dependence of forgetting on the learning rate in backpropagation. We also explain why overtraining affects forgetting and fault tolerance, which are seen as related problems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.377971","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"657","endPage":"668","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8611/00377971.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.377971","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line learning with minimal degradation in feedforward networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Degradation","Intelligent networks","Backpropagation algorithms","Interference","Encoding","Constraint optimization","Fault tolerance","Adaptive systems","Systems engineering and theory","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedforward neural nets","backpropagation","optimisation","encoding","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online learning","feedforward neural networks","encoding","constrained optimization","hidden-unit activations","minimal degradation learning","backpropagation","forgetting factor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"On-line learning with minimal degradation in feedforward networks","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4960406","pubMedId":"18263351","publicationDate":"May 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377971/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line learning with minimal degradation in feedforward networks","sourcePdf":"00377971.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065006S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"24","articleId":"377971","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":377972,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao-Hu Yu","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, National Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiao-Hu Yu","id":"37087151801"},{"name":"Guo-An Chen","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, National Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Guo-An Chen","id":"37087296042"},{"name":"Shi-Xin Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Radio Engineering, National Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Shi-Xin Cheng","id":"37087215948"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"377972","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":121,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":961},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=377972","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Backpropagation algorithms","Computer networks","Iterative algorithms","Optimization methods","Gradient methods","Convergence","Acceleration","Computer architecture","Application software","Computer simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","optimisation","Newton method","conjugate gradient methods","convergence","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic learning rate optimization","backpropagation algorithm","backpropagation error surfaces","flat regions","steep regions","derivative information","backward propagation","forward propagation","linear expansion","line searches","descent value method","Newton-like method","momentum","conjugate gradient method","convergence"]}],"doi":"10.1109/72.377972","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8611/00377972.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","startPage":"669","endPage":"677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8611","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.377972","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic learning rate optimization of the backpropagation algorithm","abstract":"It has been observed by many authors that the backpropagation (BP) error surfaces usually consist of a large amount of flat regions as well as extremely steep regions. As such, the BP algorithm with a fixed learning rate will have low efficiency. This paper considers dynamic learning rate optimization of the BP algorithm using derivative information. An efficient method of deriving the first and second derivatives of the objective function with respect to the learning rate is explored, which does not involve explicit calculation of second-order derivatives in weight space, but rather uses the information gathered from the forward and backward propagation, Several learning rate optimization approaches are subsequently established based on linear expansion of the actual outputs and line searches with acceptable descent value and Newton-like methods, respectively. Simultaneous determination of the optimal learning rate and momentum is also introduced by showing the equivalence between the momentum version BP and the conjugate gradient method. Since these approaches are constructed by simple manipulations of the obtained derivatives, the computational and storage burden scale with the network size exactly like the standard BP algorithm, and the convergence of the BP algorithm is accelerated with in a remarkable reduction (typically by factor 10 to 50, depending upon network architectures and applications) in the running time for the overall learning process. Numerous computer simulation results are provided to support the present approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377972/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4960407","pubMedId":"18263352","volume":"6","issue":"3","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic learning rate optimization of the backpropagation algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic learning rate optimization of the backpropagation algorithm","sourcePdf":"00377972.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032046S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"121","articleId":"377972","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-07"},{"_id":377973,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The NN has two layers so that linearity in the parameters holds, but the \"net functional reconstruction error\" and robot disturbance input are taken as nonzero. The structure of the NN controller is derived using a filtered error/passivity approach, leading to new NN passivity properties. Online weight tuning algorithms including a correction term to backpropagation, plus an added robustifying signal, guarantee tracking as well as bounded NN weights. The NN controller structure has an outer tracking loop so that the NN weights are conveniently initialized at zero, with learning occurring online in real-time. It is shown that standard backpropagation, when used for real-time closed-loop control, can yield unbounded NN weights if (1) the net cannot exactly reconstruct a certain required control function or (2) there are bounded unknown disturbances in the robot dynamics.

MAX-CLIQUE is the optimization problem of finding the largest clique in a given graph and is NP-hard, even to approximate well. Several real-world and theory problems can be modeled as MAX-CLIQUE. In this paper, we efficiently approximate MAX-CLIQUE in a special case of the Hopfield network whose stable states are maximal cliques. We present several energy-descent optimizing dynamics; both discrete (deterministic and stochastic) and continuous. One of these emulates, as special cases, two well-known greedy algorithms for approximating MAX-CLIQUE. We report on detailed empirical comparisons on random graphs and on harder ones. Mean-field annealing, an efficient approximation to simulated annealing, and a stochastic dynamics are the narrow but clear winners. All dynamics approximate much better than one which emulates a \"naive\" greedy heuristic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.377977","startPage":"724","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8611/00377977.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.377977","endPage":"735","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8611","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximating maximum clique with a Hopfield network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377977/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","displayDocTitle":"Approximating maximum clique with a Hopfield network","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4960412","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"May 1995","pubMedId":"18263357","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximating maximum clique with a Hopfield network","sourcePdf":"00377977.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039843S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"62","articleId":"377977","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":377979,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The success of many learning schemes is not guaranteed, however, since algorithms like backpropagation may get stuck in local minima, thus providing suboptimal solutions. For feedforward networks, optimal learning can be achieved provided that certain conditions on the network and the learning environment are met. This principle is investigated for the case of networks using radial basis functions (RBF). It is assumed that the patterns of the learning environment are separable by hyperspheres. In that case, we prove that the attached cost function is local minima free with respect to all the weights. This provides us with some theoretical foundations for a massive application of RBF in pattern recognition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.377979","startPage":"749","endPage":"756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.377979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8611/00377979.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning without local minima in radial basis function networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377979/","displayDocTitle":"Learning without local minima in radial basis function networks","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4960414","pubMedId":"18263359","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning without local minima in radial basis function networks","sourcePdf":"00377979.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038041S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"147","articleId":"377979","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":377982,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Radar returns from realistic aircraft are synthesized using a thin wire time domain electromagnetic code. The time varying backscattered electric field from each target is processed using both a conventional scheme and an ANN-based scheme for classification purposes. It is found that a multilayer feedforward ANN, trained using a backpropagation learning algorithm, provides a higher percentage of successful classification than the conventional scheme. The performance of the ANN is found to be particularly attractive in an environment of low signal-to-noise ratio. The performance of both methods are also compared when a preemphasis filter is used to enhance the contributions from the high frequency poles in the target response.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.377982","startPage":"760","endPage":"766","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.377982","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8611","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/8611/00377982.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust radar target classifier using artificial neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/377982/","displayDocTitle":"Robust radar target classifier using artificial neural networks","volume":"6","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4960416","pubMedId":"18263361","publicationDate":"May 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1995","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1995","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust radar target classifier using artificial neural networks","sourcePdf":"00377982.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037697S","chronDate":"May  1995","isNumber":"8611","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"26","articleId":"377982","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":377984,"authors":[{"name":"F.X.

The wire length in this circuit grows only linearly with the number of elements, and the circuit is more suitable for real-time processing than the Hopfield networks because the present circuit produces the solution almost instantaneously-in contrast to the Hopfield network, which requires transient convergence to the solution from a precise initial state.

Modeling accuracy is measured by mean squared error (MSE) with respect to the distribution of random inputs. Optimality is defined by minimizing the MSE, with the resultant combination referred to as MSE-OLC.

Signal Process., vol. 40, no. 7, p.1643-51, 1992) recently introduced the \"minimum order augmentation\" technique for pipelining IIR digital filters which guarantees the addition of the least number of superfluous poles to obtain a stable pipelined IIR filter while maintaining a \"clustered look-ahead\" pipeline structure. Unfortunately, this minimization of the superfluous poles comes at the expense of adding additional denominator multipliers. In this paper, we introduce a \"minimum order clustered look-ahead\" that achieves the minimum number of superfluous poles possible while minimizing the total-number of multipliers for a \"clustered look-ahead\" pipeline structure. We show that while our new technique does in some instances require more superfluous poles, the increase in hardware complexity with respect to incremental augmentation is lower when compared to the Lim and Liu approach. A MATLAB computer program is described which allows the design of any order pipelined IIR filter. Examples demonstrate that stable \"clustered look-ahead\" pipelined IIR filters can be designed with the minimum number of superfluous poles (as achieved by Lim and Liu), but with fewer denominator multipliers thus reducing significantly the computational complexity in many cases. Furthermore, an analytic solution to the second-order case gives a very practical approach to pipelined IIR filter design with great insight into the stability characteristics of pipelined IIR filters.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.378040","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.378040","startPage":"269","endPage":"274","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/8613/00378040.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New approach to clustered look-ahead pipelined IIR digital filters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Apr 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Apr 1995","displayDocTitle":"New approach to clustered look-ahead pipelined IIR digital filters","publicationDate":"April 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"42","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4960763","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/378040/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New approach to clustered look-ahead pipelined IIR digital filters","sourcePdf":"00378040.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048121S","chronDate":"Apr 1995","isNumber":"8613","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"15","articleId":"378040","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":378047,"authors":[{"name":"A.B.

The backpropagation algorithm is used to adjust the motor speed so that the neural model output follows the desired trajectory. This backpropagation mechanism forces the estimated speed to follow the actual motor speed precisely. This article describes both the theoretical analysis as well as the simulation results to verify the effectiveness of the new method.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2943.378053","startPage":"28","endPage":"32","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel1/2943/8614/00378053.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Industry Applications Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2943.378053","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Motor speed identification via neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Biological neural networks","Backpropagation","Rotors","Induction motor drives","Induction motors","Multi-layer neural network","Independent component analysis","Trajectory","Impedance matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","machine control","velocity control","digital control","neurocontrollers","backpropagation","real-time systems","adaptive control","electric machine analysis computing","control system analysis computing","digital simulation","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["induction motor drives","vector control","neural networks","speed identification","sensorless control","computer control","backpropagation","real-time adaptive identification","estimation objective","algorithm","trajectory","simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/378053/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan/Feb 1995","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan/Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"Motor speed identification via neural networks","volume":"1","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan.-Feb. 1995","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4870834","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Motor speed identification via neural networks","sourcePdf":"00378053.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037934S","chronDate":"Jan/Feb 1995","isNumber":"8614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2943","citationCount":"32","articleId":"378053","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":378082,"authors":[{"name":"P.

A fully operational PAM (programmable active memory) implementation of RSA that combines all of the techniques presented here delivers an RSA secret decryption rate over 600-kb/s for 512-b keys, and 165-kb/s for 1-kb keys. This is an order of magnitude faster than any previously reported running implementation. While the implementation makes full use of the PAM's reconfigurability, it is possible to derive from the (multiple PAM designs) implementation a (single) gate-array specification with estimated size under 100 K gates and speed over 1 Mb/s for RSA 512-b keys.

An example of a trivial operation is integer division, where the divisor is two; the division becomes a simple shift operation. The concept of redundant computation, in which some operation repeatedly does the same function because it repeatedly sees the same operands, is also discussed. Experiments on two separate benchmark suites, the SPEC benchmarks and the Perfect Club, find a surprising amount of trivial and redundant operation. Various architectural means of exploiting this knowledge to improve computational efficiency include detection of trivial operands and the result cache. Further experimentation shows significant speedup from these techniques, as measured on three different styles of machine architecture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 11th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","pdfPath":"/iel2/3022/8615/00378089.pdf","startPage":"220","endPage":"227","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 11th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic","doi":"10.1109/ARITH.1993.378089","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ARITH.1993.378089","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=378089","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting trivial and redundant computation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Water heating","Heat transfer","Computer architecture","Equations","Sun","Laboratories","Velocity measurement","Computer aided instruction","High performance computing","Arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trivial computation","simple operands","integer division","redundant computation","SPEC benchmarks","Perfect Club","computational efficiency","speedup","machine architecture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/378089/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Jun-2 Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting trivial and redundant computation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4885376","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 June-2 July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting trivial and redundant computation","confLoc":"Windsor, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"00378089.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.020688S","chronDate":"29 Jun-2 Jul 1993","isNumber":"8615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3022","citationCount":"32","articleId":"378089","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":378090,"authors":[{"name":"T.K.

Many accuracy requirements for the LNS arithmetic unit are possible, but a round to nearest cannot be easily achieved. The goal suggested here is to ensure that the worst case LNS relative error is smaller than the worst case FP relative error.

The finite element method is used to represent the model as a continuous surface. A natural finite element is used whose nodal variables comprise the position of the surface plus its first and second partial derivatives, reflecting each of the partial derivatives that occur in the spline's strain energy functional. Hence, the model directly estimates all the information needed to measure the differential geometric properties of the fitted surface. The balloon model was applied to the reconstruction of 3-D objects with irregular shape features.

The modifications address problems that were encountered with past implementations of pyramid-based fusion. In particular, the modifications provide greater shift invariance and immunity to video noise, and provide at least a partial solution to the problem of combining components that have roughly equal salience but opposite contrasts. The fusion algorithm was found to perform well for a range of tasks without requiring adjustment of the algorithm parameters. Results were remarkably insensitive to changes in these parameters, suggesting that the procedure is both robust and generic. A composite imaging technique is outlined that may provide a powerful tool for image capture.

The method operates by extracting two-dimensional models of an object from a sequence of images. The basic idea underlying the technique is to decompose the image of a solid object moving in space into two components: a two-dimensional motion and a two-dimensional shape change. The motion component is factored out and the shape change is represented explicitly by a sequence of two-dimensional models, one corresponding to each image frame. The major assumption underlying the method is that the two-dimensional shape of an object will change slowly from one frame to the next. There is no assumption, however, that the two-dimensional image motion between successive frames will be small.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1993 (4th) International Conference on Computer Vision","pdfPath":"/iel2/3023/8616/00378231.pdf","startPage":"93","endPage":"101","publicationTitle":"1993 (4th) International Conference on Computer Vision","doi":"10.1109/ICCV.1993.378231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCV.1993.378231","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8616","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=378231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tracking non-rigid objects in complex scenes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Layout","Shape","Tracking","Image sequences","Computer science","Solids","Computer vision","Data mining","Contracts","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["motion estimation","image recognition","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonrigid objects tracking","complex scenes","model-based method","two-dimensional models","solid object","two-dimensional motion","two-dimensional shape change"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/378231/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 May 1993","displayDocTitle":"Tracking non-rigid objects in complex scenes","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4903422","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 May 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tracking non-rigid objects in complex scenes","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"00378231.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050283S","chronDate":"11-14 May 1993","isNumber":"8616","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3023","citationCount":"106","articleId":"378231","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":378302,"authors":[{"name":"G.B.

The performance of the MULTIWAVE algorithm is found to be superior to that of the TURNING POINT algorithm at all compression rates for all ECG records.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of Computers in Cardiology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/3025/8618/00378421.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"396","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of Computers in Cardiology Conference","doi":"10.1109/CIC.1993.378421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIC.1993.378421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8618","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=378421","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MULTIWAVE: a multiresolution wavelet-based ECG data compression algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Data compression","Signal analysis","Frequency","Signal resolution","Algorithm design and analysis","Rhythm","Turning","Wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrocardiography","medical signal processing","data compression","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MULTIWAVE","multiresolution wavelet-based ECG data compression algorithm","ECG signals","pyramidal algorithm","orthonormal set","decimation","normal sinus rhythm","NSR","supraventricular tachycardia","SVT","ventricular tachycardia","TURNING POINT algorithm","compression rates"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/378421/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-8 Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"MULTIWAVE: a multiresolution wavelet-based ECG data compression algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","accessionNumber":"4903536","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"5-8 Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MULTIWAVE: a multiresolution wavelet-based ECG data compression algorithm","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"00378421.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044285S","chronDate":"5-8 Sep 1993","isNumber":"8618","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3025","citationCount":"20","articleId":"378421","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-09"},{"_id":378432,"authors":[{"name":"R.

As such, research studies have focused on developing theoretical and empirical foundations for understanding ethical decision making. Empirical studies have, however, used traditional quantitative analytic tools such as regression or discriminant analysis to investigate ethical issues. With the increased emphasis on ethics in organizations, more advanced tools are needed. In this exploratory research, a new approach to classifying, categorizing and analyzing ethical decision situations is presented. A comparative performance analysis of artificial neural networks, MDA and the chance approach indicated that artificial neural networks are better predictors in both training and testing phases. While some limitations of this approach were noted, in the field of business ethics, these networks possess considerable potential as an alternative to traditional analytic tools like MDA.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CAIA.1995.378805","pdfPath":"/iel2/3030/8623/00378805.pdf","startPage":"320","endPage":"325","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings the 11th Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Applications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings the 11th Conference on Artificial Intelligence for Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CAIA.1995.378805","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8623","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An application of artificial neural networks in evaluating business ethics: an exploratory study","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/378805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Feb 1995","displayDocTitle":"An application of artificial neural networks in evaluating business ethics: an exploratory study","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4912144","publicationDate":"1995","conferenceDate":"20-23 Feb. 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An application of artificial neural networks in evaluating business ethics: an exploratory study","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00378805.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043953S","chronDate":"20-23 Feb 1995","isNumber":"8623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3030","citationCount":"4","articleId":"378805","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":378811,"authors":[{"name":"J.

The advantages and disadvantages of the simplex hybrid are discussed and the hybrid is tested against several different problem sets to verify its improvement over the generic genetic algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/378811/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 Feb 1995","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"1995","accessionNumber":"4912138","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"20-23 Feb. 1995","isConference":true,"displayDocTitle":"A hybrid approach to modeling metabolic systems using genetic algorithm and simplex method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid approach to modeling metabolic systems using genetic algorithm and simplex method","confLoc":"Los Angeles, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00378811.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049053S","chronDate":"20-23 Feb 1995","isNumber":"8623","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3030","citationCount":"17","articleId":"378811","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1995","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":378837,"authors":[{"name":"S.J.

Owing to their traveling-wave operation, these devices offer the potential for very high speed operation as well as continuous tuning of the input and output wavelengths. In addition, since the converted signal is the phase-conjugate replica of the input signal, the conversion is transparent to the modulation format, and provides the possibility for fiber-dispersion-compensation in lightwave communication systems. In this paper, we present measurements of wavelength conversion efficiencies in TWA's for /spl Delta//spl lambda/-shifts as large as 27 nm.

The idea of using median type filtering as an aid for the matched filter is tested for the noncoherent case.

The search rate of direct sequence acquisition schemes can be significantly increased by replacing the multiply and integrate operation with a passive correlation device such as a matched filter (MF). The problems of acquisition using the matched filter have attracted considerable interest. Many results were derived assuming a single user in a fading and multipath delay mobile environment or multi-users in the additive white Gaussian noise channel. In the present paper a numerical method and computer simulation have been developed to simulate the acquisition. The acquisition performance using a matched filter with different numbers of parallel processors is investigated in the multipath delay and fading channel for a CDMA system. The results show that the acquisition performance is significantly degraded in this channel, even when large values of correlation length, which require fewer parallel processors, are used, The performance of a proposed new channel filter placed before the correlator is examined using a Monte Carlo method. Comparison or results of the performance of the correlator using the matched filter with different numbers of parallel processors, with and without the proposed channel filter, shows that the normalized mean acquisition time can be reduced by a factor of 10 when the new channel filter is used.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379516","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379516.pdf","startPage":"593","endPage":"597 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379516","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rapid acquisition schemes for CDMA systems in a multipath delay and fading environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379516/","displayDocTitle":"Rapid acquisition schemes for CDMA systems in a multipath delay and fading environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4911686","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rapid acquisition schemes for CDMA systems in a multipath delay and fading environment","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379516.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029314S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","articleId":"379516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":379517,"authors":[{"name":"W.

A third-order polynomial without memory is used to present LD nonlinearity. In DS/CDMA systems, only one harmonic of the third-order intermodulation term falls on the signal frequency band and influences the system performance. The average distortion is derived with only the information of auto-correlation functions. The results are useful for CDMA system design and performance analysis. With LD nonlinearity it is necessary to select an optimal modulation index that provides a maximum carrier-to-noise ratio (CIN). The effect of the LD nonlinearity on CDMA and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) is also compared.

The results demonstrate that the number-state system requires less than half the energy consumed by the coherent-state one in order to attain the same performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance comparison of number- and coherent-state optical CDMA in lossy direct-detection photon channels","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379520","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379520.pdf","startPage":"574","endPage":"578 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379520","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379520/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance comparison of number- and coherent-state optical CDMA in lossy direct-detection photon channels","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4911682","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance comparison of number- and coherent-state optical CDMA in lossy direct-detection photon channels","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077148S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","articleId":"379520","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":379524,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

Since the frequency power spectrum of CW and narrow band interference signals are larger than that of the spread-spectrum signal, these interference signals can be reduced by limiting the signal level in the frequency domain. The proposed method is composed of FDM/TDM transform using a filter bank and an amplitude limiter adjusted to the spectrum of the spread-spectrum signal. The received signals are divided into separate narrow frequency bands in real time using a frequency function and the amplitude of these signals is limited. This signal processing reduces the interference signals. This paper describes the principle design of the transform circuit and explains the optimum limiting technique. In particular, the proposed digital processing model is compared with the analog processing model which has already been reported. In addition, the adjustment level of the amplitude limiter for the DS and FH spread-spectrum signal is shown. Finally, the improvement in interference suppression using FFT and the optimum limiting limiter is demonstrated with measured the eye pattern of the correlated signal. The performance of this suppressor is shown by measuring the bit error rate in the presence of CW interference signals and Gaussian noise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An interference suppressor for CW and narrow-band signals using filter bank on CDMA communications","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379531","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379531.pdf","startPage":"521","endPage":"525 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"An interference suppressor for CW and narrow-band signals using filter bank on CDMA communications","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4911671","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An interference suppressor for CW and narrow-band signals using filter bank on CDMA communications","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379531.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039036S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"1","articleId":"379531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":379533,"authors":[{"name":"M.B.K.

A set of virtual codes is a family of codes that has only its properties (e.g. crosscorrelation, randomness) defined as desired. Virtual codes are considered because of the problems that exist in drawing conclusions when an actual set of codes is used. An examination of the influence of code phase for a small set of actual codes shows that the performance call vary over a magnitude or more at larger bit-energy to noise ratios and smaller user numbers, thus making conclusions drawn from an actual set of codes potentially subjective. This paper employs a virtual set of codes to develop a technique that will allow the influence of properties, such as the peak crosscorrelation value, and the occurrence of values and adjacent pairs of values of the discrete-time correlation, on the performance of the system to be observed. Such analysis whilst approximate, provides a valuable insight into code properties that should be considered when selecting a subset of codes for use in a Q-CDMA system, or in designing code generation methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379536","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379536.pdf","startPage":"494","endPage":"499 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379536","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Code properties: influences on the performance of a quaternary CDMA system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379536","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379536/","displayDocTitle":"Code properties: influences on the performance of a quaternary CDMA system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4911666","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Code properties: influences on the performance of a quaternary CDMA system","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379536.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039526S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"4","articleId":"379536","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":379539,"authors":[{"name":"S.

We analyze the performance of the down-link (i.e. the base-to-mobile link) of a low Earth orbiting (LEO) mobile satellite channel. An important characteristic of this fading channel is that the desired signal and the multiple access interference from the same base station fade simultaneously. As a consequence, the performance degradation due to fading will be smaller than for the mobile-to-base links, where fading of the desired signal and the interference are independent. In the limit, one can distinguish between two extreme scenarios. When the thermal noise is dominant relative to multiple access interference, the performance approaches that of a single user in fading channels. At the other extreme, when the energy-per-bit-to-noise power spectral density ratio is very high, the effect of fading on the desired signal becomes negligible, because the equivalent signal-to-noise ratio remains practically constant, in the absence of multiple access interference from other base stations. In practical situations, there may be multiple access interference from other satellites, and the ratio of energy-per-bit-to-thermal noise power spectral density has some finite valuer between the two extreme cases. We analyze the probability of error for the down-link of a mobile satellite channel when coherent detection, diversity and forward error correction are employed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379568","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379568.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379568","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","startPage":"330","endPage":"337 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Downlink DS CDMA performance over a mobile LEOs channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379568","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Downlink DS CDMA performance over a mobile LEOs channel","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379568/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903938","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Downlink DS CDMA performance over a mobile LEOs channel","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379568.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040162S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"1","articleId":"379568","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":379569,"authors":[{"name":"G.E.

However, before synchronism to the desired sequence is achieved, the presence of multiple access interference (MAI) is a major impairment which determines the performance of the code acquisition sub-system. It has been argued that the acquisition performance in the presence of MAI may pose limits to the capacity of a CDMA system which are more stringent than those coming from bit error probability specifications. We introduce a general definition for acquisition-based capacity of a CDMA system. This quantity is evaluated for an acquisition sub-system with non-coherent correlator/detector and straight serial search in the time uncertainty region. The effect of imperfect power control is also analysed, showing that the capacity may be substantially decreased when the residual standard deviation of the received power level is above 1 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acquisition-based capacity estimates for CDMA with imperfect power control","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379569","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379569.pdf","startPage":"325","endPage":"329 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379569","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Acquisition-based capacity estimates for CDMA with imperfect power control","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903937","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acquisition-based capacity estimates for CDMA with imperfect power control","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379569.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044638S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"10","articleId":"379569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":379570,"authors":[{"name":"R.

They have investigated CDMA systems considering direct sequence (DS), slow frequency hopping (SFH), hybrid SFH/DS, hybrid CDMA/inhibit sense multiple access (ISMA), multi-carrier (MC)-CDMA, interference cancellation, dynamic code channel allocation, synchronization, receiver structure and overlay CDMA/TDMA systems for macro-, micro- and pico-cellular systems as well as for land mobile satellite systems. The effect of forward error correction (FEC) coding and of diversity techniques on CDMA systems performance is also analyzed. Computer simulation has been performed to verify the basic assumptions, such as approximating by multi-users interference by a Gaussian random variable, in the analysis. Results of these investigations are summarized and discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379570.pdf","startPage":"319","endPage":"324 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379570","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379570","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An overview of TU Delft research on CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Forward error correction","Performance analysis","Radio spectrum management","Interference cancellation","Channel allocation","Frequency synchronization","Time division multiple access","Satellites","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","radiofrequency interference","frequency hop communication","interference suppression","frequency allocation","cellular radio","land mobile radio","mobile satellite communication","diversity reception","forward error correction","synchronisation","Gaussian processes","performance evaluation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA","TU Delft","interference cancellation","Delft University of Technology","The Netherlands","code division multiple access","direct sequence spread spectrum","slow frequency hopping","hybrid SFH/DS","hybrid CDMA/inhibit sense multiple access","multicarrier-CDMA","dynamic code channel allocation","synchronization","receiver structure","overlay CDMA/TDMA systems","picocellular systems","microcellular systems","land mobile satellite systems","forward error correction","FEC coding","diversity techniques","computer simulation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379570/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"An overview of TU Delft research on CDMA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903936","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An overview of TU Delft research on CDMA","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379570.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081693S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"3","articleId":"379570","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":379572,"authors":[{"name":"G.J.R.

The TDD base station measures the impulse response of the channel (on the uplink) and uses a matched filter to the channel. It then pre-matches the signal it wishes to transmit on the downlink since its impulse response is identical. This eliminates any channel matched filter operations in the mobile unit and so reduces its complexity, although the base station complexity is increased slightly. Results indicate that FDD techniques provide a higher cell capacity than the equivalent TDD techniques. The advantage of a reduction in mobile station complexity, by using TDD, is offset by the poor error rate and cell capacity performances found for high speed mobile operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379572","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379572.pdf","startPage":"309","endPage":"313 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379572","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency and time division duplex techniques for CDMA cellular radio","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379572","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379572/","displayDocTitle":"Frequency and time division duplex techniques for CDMA cellular radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903934","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency and time division duplex techniques for CDMA cellular radio","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379572.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021216S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"4","articleId":"379572","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":379580,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The method of moments is used to accurately assess the system error probability. Using this technique, one can also assess the accuracy of assuming that the multiuser interference has a Gaussian distribution, which allows calculations to be analyzed by simpler means. It is verified that the Gaussian assumption is sufficiently accurate under the conditions considered. Cellular system performance is further investigated with voice activity monitoring and cell splitting under AWGN, Rayleigh fading and multipath conditions typical for personal and mobile communications. Block codes of relative low complexity are investigated when Gold sequences of length 255 and 127 are employed for purposes of PN spreading. The average degradation due to interuser interference is determined by employing exact aperiodic correlation parameters as defined by Pursely [1977]. Numerical results indicate that for a given processing gain and number of interfering users, appropriate coding can allow for reliable communication even under multipath fading conditions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of cellular SSMA with block coding under fading and multipath conditions","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379581","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379581.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"267 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379581/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Performance of cellular SSMA with block coding under fading and multipath conditions","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903925","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of cellular SSMA with block coding under fading and multipath conditions","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379581.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068954S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","articleId":"379581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":379584,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The channel model is frequency selective fading typical of mobile digital radio systems. An efficient decoding scheme is proposed to relieve performance losses at the receiver due to user interference. Sequential decoding is a valid alternative to Viterbi decoding, and particularly the backtracking algorithm when long constraints convolutional codes are imposed by system performance. Purely breadth first sequential decoding algorithms such as the M-algorithm present inherent parallelism (adapt to a parallel HW realization) but are, as pointed out by Anderson [1992], less efficient in terms of average number of paths searched with respect to the backtracking algorithm, while representing a search performed by the Viterbi algorithm. The authors propose a technique which is a modified version of a Fano-like algorithm in which the forward operations are performed by means of a breadth first algorithm: this modification presents many advantages. First of all, backtracking events are limited. In this way the decoder proceeds faster and with a lower delay. Second: the searches are made in parallel, allowing a smaller buffering and hence a simpler VLSI realization with respect to the traditional Fano decoder. An analysis is performed of the uncoded detection scheme and the results of the simulations of the encoded scheme are compared. Large coding gains seem possible when employing an adapt interleaving and an efficient power control system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379584","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379584.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"257 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid breadth/depth first technique to improve convolutionally encoded /spl pi/4-shifted DQPSK over asynchronous CDMA fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379584","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379584/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid breadth/depth first technique to improve convolutionally encoded /spl pi/4-shifted DQPSK over asynchronous CDMA fading channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903923","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid breadth/depth first technique to improve convolutionally encoded /spl pi/4-shifted DQPSK over asynchronous CDMA fading channels","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379584.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056716S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"1","articleId":"379584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":379585,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The ADC scheme uses a Viterbi decoder combined with a CRC code to generate retransmission requests, while the CC scheme employs a sequential decoder operating with the time-out algorithm. Multiple received packets are combined to form a single, more reliable packet. The error correcting decoder operates on the combined packet, as opposed to the most recently received individual packet (e.g. as in a type-I hybrid ARQ protocol), substantially increasing the probability of acceptance with each additional transmission. The authors show through numerical analysis that both techniques provide a significant increase in the CDMA system capacity, throughput and reliability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379585","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379585.pdf","startPage":"248","endPage":"252 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Packet combining error control for CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379585/","displayDocTitle":"Packet combining error control for CDMA systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903922","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Packet combining error control for CDMA systems","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379585.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.026189S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","articleId":"379585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":379592,"authors":[{"name":"V.M.

These degrading effects can be combatted by joint detection (JD) techniques. In order to reduce the performance impairments resulting from time variance, coherent receiver antenna diversity (CRAD) can be used. A system model of CDMA mobile radio systems using various JD techniques in combination with CRAD is introduced. This system model is an evolution of the pan-European GSM and takes important real world aspects such as imperfect channel estimation, nonlinear amplification and D/A and A/D conversion into account. The viability of JD with CRAD is demonstrated by bit error rate simulations of this system model. It is shown that by using JD with two receiver antennas in bad urban areas, E/sub bN/sub 0/<8 dB per antenna is sufficient for a bit error rate of 10/sup -2/, and E/sub bN/sub 0/<11 dB per antenna is required for a bit error rate of 10/sup -3/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379596.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"197 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379596","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379596","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379596","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Realistic simulations of CDMA mobile radio systems using joint detection and coherent receiver antenna diversity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio","Receiving antennas","Bit error rate","Receivers","Intersymbol interference","Multiple access interference","Degradation","Antennas and propagation","GSM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","land mobile radio","radiofrequency interference","multipath channels","radio receivers","signal detection","diversity reception","cellular radio","simulation","intersymbol interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CDMA mobile radio systems","simulations","time variant multipath propagation","intersymbol interference","multiple access interference","CDMA receivers","coherent receiver antenna diversity","joint detection techniques","system model","pan-European GSM","imperfect channel estimation","nonlinear amplification","A/D conversion","D/A conversion","bit error rate","urban areas"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379596/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Realistic simulations of CDMA mobile radio systems using joint detection and coherent receiver antenna diversity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903911","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Realistic simulations of CDMA mobile radio systems using joint detection and coherent receiver antenna diversity","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379596.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040334S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"6","articleId":"379596","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":379597,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The proposed linear structure is as simple as a standard single-user-detector receiver consisting of a matched filter with constant coefficients except that it requires separate channel for the transmitter adaptation. The concept of an adaptive transmitter maintains advantages with respect to timing recovery, near far effect, narrow-band and frequency selective fading interference suppression and user privacy compared to the systems with conventional matched filter receiver and further improves multiple-access interference elimination compared with the systems employing an adaptive receiver only.

For spread spectrum multiple access, co-channel interference (CCI) limits the performance of a communication link. To remove this interference, several CCI cancellation techniques have been proposed. Especially techniques which do not require the receiver to have knowledge of the cross-correlation between user sequences have been presented. However, these methods leave residual interference after the cancellation caused by errors on the initial decision. To reduce the residual interference and improve the initial decision, the proposed scheme utilizes the error correcting capability of the orthogonal convolutional code. This paper evaluates the performance of this scheme. It is shown that up to about 40 users, the proposed CCI canceller has a performance which is near the optimum performance when multiuser interference is completely canceled. It is also shown that the proposed CCI canceller offers an improvement in capacity by a factor of 1.5/spl sim/3 as compared with a conventional canceller.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interchannel interference","Interference cancellation","Convolutional codes","Radiofrequency interference","Multiaccess communication","Time division multiple access","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency division multiaccess","Bandwidth","Error correction codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","convolutional codes","error correction codes","cochannel interference","interference suppression","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["co-channel interference cancellation","orthogonal convolutional codes","spread spectrum multiple access","communication link","residual interference reduction","error correcting code","multiuser interference","capacity","CDMA","pseudonoise code"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379600","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379600.pdf","startPage":"176","endPage":"180 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Co-channel interference cancellation technique using orthogonal convolutional codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379600","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Co-channel interference cancellation technique using orthogonal convolutional codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379600/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903907","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Co-channel interference cancellation technique using orthogonal convolutional codes","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379600.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046304S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"4","articleId":"379600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":379601,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The weights of the canceler are adaptively controlled by the steepest descent algorithm using the minimum power criterion of the canceler outputs. It was shown that such a canceler substantially outperforms the decorrelating detector and has almost the same error probability as a canceler that uses reliable estimates of the received signal energies. In this paper, a different weight control criterion based on minimizing the correlation between the signals at the outputs of the canceler is used, and its performance is compared to that obtained with the minimum power criterion. It is shown that both cancelers have almost the same performance, particularly when SNR is modestly high. Although it is not shown in this paper, we believe that minimizing correlation rather than power outputs is a more suitable criterion when dealing with highly dispersive channels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379603.pdf","startPage":"162","endPage":"166 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379603","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379603","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bootstrapped decorrelating algorithm for adaptive interference cancelation in synchronous CDMA communications systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decorrelation","Interference cancellation","Code division multiplexing","Multiaccess communication","Detectors","Signal processing algorithms","Filters","Impedance matching","Communication system traffic","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["synchronisation","code division multiple access","interference suppression","adaptive signal processing","signal detection","probability","coding errors","error statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bootstrapped decorrelating algorithm","adaptive interference cancelation","synchronous CDMA communications systems","code division multiple access","CDMA detector","correlation detector","multiuser adaptive interference canceler","steepest descent algorithm","minimum power criterion","canceler outputs","error probability","received signal energies","weight control","SNR","performance"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379603/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Bootstrapped decorrelating algorithm for adaptive interference cancelation in synchronous CDMA communications systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903904","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bootstrapped decorrelating algorithm for adaptive interference cancelation in synchronous CDMA communications systems","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379603.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033063S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"7","articleId":"379603","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":379604,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In a multiuser environment this approach is suboptimal and it does not lead to a near-far resistant (NFR) receiver. A NFR receiver, optimum or suboptimum, utilizes the multivariate statistics provided by the bank of matched filters in order to make a decision for any single user. Several multiuser detection algorithms have been proposed. This paper introduces an adaptive CDMA multiuser detector. The proposed detector combines channel estimation and data detection in a recursive structure driven by learning rules motivated by a self-organizing neural network. Both data-aided and blind learning are possible at a reasonable computational cost. The performance of the self-organizing detector is compared with other multiuser detection schemes and simulation results are provided.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379605","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379605","startPage":"152","endPage":"156 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379605.pdf","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Self-organizing multiuser detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Self-organizing multiuser detection","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4903902","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379605/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-organizing multiuser detection","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379605.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047188S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"7","articleId":"379605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":379608,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The focus in this paper is on noncoherent combining of the outputs of the taps of the rake receiver in a code-division multiple-access (CDMA) system that employs DS spread spectrum with binary DPSK data modulation. It is shown that the advantages and disadvantages of a rake receiver, as compared with a standard correlation receiver, depend greatly on the fading characteristics of the individual multipath components. In general, rake receivers are more appropriate for DS systems with a smaller number of chips per data symbol and for channels that have only diffuse, Rayleigh fading multipath components. On the other hand, a correlation receiver is preferred for DS systems with a large number of chips per data symbol if the channel has a strong specular multipath component in addition to one or more diffuse components. The probability of error on the channel is determined as a function of the chip rate for doubly selective fading channels, and the pairwise error probability is evaluated for a CDMA system with binary convolutional encoding and Viterbi decoding. The effects of the Doppler spread and the interleaving depth on the performance of the system and the choice of chip rate are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379610","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379610.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379610","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","startPage":"98","endPage":"104 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rake reception for a CDMA mobile communication system with multipath fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379610","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Rake reception for a CDMA mobile communication system with multipath fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379610/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903897","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rake reception for a CDMA mobile communication system with multipath fading","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379610.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076484S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"3","articleId":"379610","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":379611,"authors":[{"name":"E.

We consider CDMA networks with voice traffic and two types of data traffic: high priority data traffic with the same priority as voice traffic that requires real-time delivery and lower priority data traffic that can tolerate delay and thus can be queued. A movable boundary policy in the CDMA code domain is used for the voice and high priority data, whereas a small number of CDMA codes are reserved for the lower priority data which also utilizes any CDMA codes left unused by the other two traffic types. The optimal policy is obtained by minimizing a cost function consisting of the weighted sum of the rejection rates of voice and high priority data traffic subject to performance requirements (bit error rates or BER) on all traffic types. The queueing delay of the lower priority data traffic is also evaluated. A semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with guaranteed BERs for voice and data traffic is used for formulating the dynamic code assignment problem. A value-iteration algorithm is applied to this SMDP to derive the optimal policy.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379611","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379611.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","startPage":"88","endPage":"97 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-media integration in CDMA networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379611","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-media integration in CDMA networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379611/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903896","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-media integration in CDMA networks","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379611.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056497S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"10","articleId":"379611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":379614,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

Co-channel interference (CCI) in CDMA is the most dominant factor in the limitation of user capacity, while the capacities of FDMA and TDMA capacities are primarily bandwidth limited. From an information theoretical viewpoint, however, an optimum multi-user receiver for CDMA can be derived by utilizing CCI as redundant information distributed among multiple accessing users. In practical channels such as personal, indoor, mobile radio communication channels, more feasible receivers are required to combat the multipath fading that causes estimation errors of the channel characteristics due to time variance. An overview of several CCI cancellation schemes for sub-optimum but practical multi-user receivers for CDMA is provided by classifying them in the temporal domain, the spatial domain, or in both domains.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379616.pdf","startPage":"51","endPage":"60 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379616","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379616","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatial and temporal filtering for co-channel interference in CDMA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Filtering","Interchannel interference","Multiaccess communication","Radiofrequency interference","Receivers","Spread spectrum communication","Frequency division multiaccess","Time division multiple access","Bandwidth","Land mobile radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","cochannel interference","pseudonoise codes","spread spectrum communication","interference suppression","channel capacity","filtering theory","radio receivers","multipath channels","fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["co-channel interference","CDMA","temporal filtering","spatial filtering","user capacity","spread spectrum multiple access","SSMA","code division multiple access","FDMA","TDMA","information theory","optimum multi-user receiver","redundant information","mobile radio communication channels","personal communication channels","indoor radio channels","multipath fading","estimation errors","channel characteristics","CCI cancellation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379616/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","displayDocTitle":"Spatial and temporal filtering for co-channel interference in CDMA","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903891","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatial and temporal filtering for co-channel interference in CDMA","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060911S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"8","articleId":"379616","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":379619,"authors":[{"name":"D.V.

More properly descriptive terms are \"error-preventing\", \"error-protecting\", or the more common \"error control.\" The reason is that in modern communication systems, designed according to the norms of information theory, coding is an integral part of the modulation process and the optimum modulator and demodulator combine the coding and modulation, as well as the decoding and demodulation, processes into one function at both the transmitter and the receiver. This viewpoint has become commonplace for modulation systems which operate in additive Gaussian noise, with relatively high signal-to-noise ratios, at bit rates considerably greater than their transmission bandwidth. For such systems and channels, the evolution and general acceptance of trellis coded modulation (TCM) has demonstrated how modulation and channel coding can be integrated to provide superior performance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379620","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE 3rd International Symposium on Spread Spectrum Techniques and Applications (ISSSTA'94)","pdfPath":"/iel2/3035/8628/00379620.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISSSTA.1994.379620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8628","startPage":"22","endPage":"26 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error-correcting coding for CDMA systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379620","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Error-correcting coding for CDMA systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379620/","conferenceDate":"4-6 July 1994","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4903887","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-correcting coding for CDMA systems","confLoc":"Oulu, Finland","sourcePdf":"00379620.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036592S","chronDate":"4-6 Jul 1994","isNumber":"8628","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3035","citationCount":"6","articleId":"379620","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":379621,"authors":[{"name":"J.L.

A new integer programming (IP) model is presented that supports simultaneous scheduling, binding, and allocation, to minimize the number of registerfiles and the interconnect complexity (or the number of tristate drivers and multiplexor inputs). The TP model is used to map an application to a registerfile architecture suitable for prototyping or implementation in user-programmable FPGA technologies, such as Xilinx 4000. The same model supports early transferring of data on busses, and at most one registerfile is connected to each bus. Application-specific architectures with fewer busses, fewer registerfiles and up to 34% fewer bus connections than previous research have been synthesized. These IP synthesized architectures have also been successfully implemented in Xilinx 4000 FPGA technology to verify the approach. This research breaks new ground by (1) simultaneously scheduling, binding, and allocating registerfile architectures in practical cpu times, (2) synthesizing architectures which are suitable for prototyping or implementing in user-programmable FPGA technologies and (3) providing industry with a DA tool for synthesizing architectures with low interconnect complexity.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference - CICC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3036/8629/00379729.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"236","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference - CICC '94","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1994.379729","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1994.379729","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8629","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=379729","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesizing optimal registerfile architectures for FPGA technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Prototypes","Computer architecture","Job shop scheduling","Synthesizers","Topology","Software prototyping","Application software","Linear programming","Processor scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific integrated circuits","programmable logic arrays","field programmable gate arrays","integer programming","scheduling","integrated circuit interconnections","logic CAD"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application-specific registerfile architectures","FPGA technology","optimal registerfile architectures","integer programming","scheduling","binding","allocation","interconnect complexity","tristate drivers","multiplexor inputs","Xilinx 4000","DA tool"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379729/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 1994","displayDocTitle":"Synthesizing optimal registerfile architectures for FPGA technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","accessionNumber":"4910141","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesizing optimal registerfile architectures for FPGA technology","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00379729.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027988S","chronDate":"1-4 May 1994","isNumber":"8629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3036","citationCount":"4","articleId":"379729","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":379733,"authors":[{"name":"R.G.

A single chip FPGA implementation of a full 16-bit 31-tap Hilbert transformer is used as an example to demonstrate the application of the multiplier module with the special consideration of FPGA architectures.

The run-time reconfiguration artificial neural network (RRANN) uses runtime reconfiguration to increase the hardware density of FPGAs. This is done by dividing the backpropagation algorithm into three sequentially executed stages and configuring the FPGAs to execute only one stage at a time. The FPGAs are reconfigured as part of normal execution in order to change stages. Using reconfigurability in this way increases the number of hardware neurons a single FPGA can implement by 500%. The RRANN architecture has been designed and built using commercially available hardware, and its performance has been measured.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/CICC.1994.379763","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference - CICC '94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CICC.1994.379763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8629","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of IEEE Custom Integrated Circuits Conference - CICC '94","pdfPath":"/iel2/3036/8629/00379763.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RRANN: the run-time reconfiguration artificial neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379763/","displayDocTitle":"RRANN: the run-time reconfiguration artificial neural network","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4903497","publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"1-4 May 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 May 1994","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RRANN: the run-time reconfiguration artificial neural network","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00379763.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04013S","chronDate":"1-4 May 1994","isNumber":"8629","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3036","citationCount":"19","articleId":"379763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":379767,"authors":[{"name":"E. de Man","affiliation":["Corporate Research and Development, Siemens AG, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"E.","lastName":"de Man","id":"37281876700"},{"name":"M.

Further, the additive noise is non-white with unknown covariance matrix whereas the beamforming algorithms assume that the noise is white. This situation leads to further deterioration in the performance of the beamformers. Whereas the former problem has been addressed by many authors, the latter has received very little attention. In the paper, a high-resolution beamforming algorithm is presented which is applicable when the interferences are fully/highly correlated with the desired signal and when the noise is spatially correlated with unknown covariance matrix. This algorithm makes use of an invariance property satisfied by persymmetric matrices to cancel out the noise covariance matrix while forming a difference matrix. The columns of this difference matrix are used to form the optimum weight vector. Two types of beamformers are considered. They are a) optimum interference notch beamformer and b) optimal combiner. Simulation results are also presented to support the theory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379831/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1994","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4890898","conferenceDate":"2-5 Oct. 1994","displayDocTitle":"High-resolution beamforming in the presence of coherent interferences and unknown correlated noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-resolution beamforming in the presence of coherent interferences and unknown correlated noise","confLoc":"Yosemite National Park, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00379831.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032729S","chronDate":"2-5 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3037","articleId":"379831","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":379836,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Simultaneous image collections from two antenna systems or two-pass single antenna collections are processed as interferometric pairs to extract corresponding pixel by pixel phase differences which encode terrain elevation height. The phase differences are wrapped values which must be unwrapped and scaled to yield terrain height. We propose two major classes of techniques that hold promise for robust multibaseline (multiple pair) interferometric SAR terrain elevation mapping. The first builds on the capability of a recently published method for robust weighted and unweighted least-squares phase unwrapping, while the second attacks the problem directly in a maximum likelihood (ML) formulation.

Down-conversion of the digitized IF signals to baseband and reduction of the quantization noise are accomplished by the multistage decimator with the complex coefficient bandpass digital filters (BPFs), of which the bandpass Hilbert transformers are composed. Most of the complex coefficient BPFs in the multistage decimator can be replaced with the lowpass filters (LPFs) under some conditions, which reduces computational burden.

The goal was to enable a smooth change in target level at a constant rate of change inspite of the two nonlinearity points introduced by the \"I\" shaped structure of the tank, after a certain amount of uncontrolled output flow has occurred.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IEMC.1994.379923","pdfPath":"/iel2/3038/8631/00379923.pdf","startPage":"250","endPage":"253","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Engineering Management Conference - IEMC '94","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of 1994 IEEE International Engineering Management Conference - IEMC '94","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IEMC.1994.379923","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=8631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks for real-time process control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/379923/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-19 Oct 1994","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks for real-time process control","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4880346","publicationDate":"1994","conferenceDate":"17-19 Oct. 1994","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks for real-time process control","confLoc":"Dayton North, OH, USA","sourcePdf":"00379923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034474S","chronDate":"17-19 Oct 1994","isNumber":"8631","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"3038","articleId":"379923","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":379968,"authors":[{"name":"S.
