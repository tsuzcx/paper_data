Double vectors, which include an active vector and a zero vector, are used during one control period to reduce steady-state current ripples. In conventional implement architecture, predictive controller and speed controller are a cascaded form. By adjusting the execution sequence of one-step compensation module and candidate vector module in the cascaded predictive controller, the maximized parallel architecture is designed. Furthermore, the parallel architecture may have the problem of disordered parameter update sequence due to the different execution steps. To ensure the orderly execution of the maximized parallel architecture, a logic trigger mechanism is designed and applied in the parallel architecture. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed parallel implement architecture.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry

International Symposium on Integrated Circuits and Systems (ISICAS) 2021, held in a hybrid way due to the COVID-19 pandemic, on December 9\u201311, 2021, in Singapore. This is the fourth edition of this journal track symposium as part of the initiative of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CASS), started in 2018. The Symposium welcomes high-quality original research papers in the areas of integrated circuits and systems, including but not limited to analog, digital, power, energy, biomedical, sensory, and communications systems. A reader will notice that all the papers presented in this Special Issue and at the conference describe integrated implementations in CMOS, hybrid, SiP or SoC forms with experimental results\u2014this
