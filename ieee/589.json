Recently Schottky diodes are offered by both USA and Europe based companies. Active switching devices such as bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), field effect transistors (JFETs and MOSFETs) are now available on the commercial market. The interest is rapidly growing for these devices in high power and high temperature applications. The main advantages of wide bandgap semiconductors are their very high critical electric field capability. From a power device perspective the high critical field strength can be used to design switching devices with much lower losses than conventional silicon based devices both for on-state losses and reduced switching losses. This paper reviews the current state of the art in active switching device performance for both SiC and GaN. SiC material quality and epitaxy processes have greatly improved and degradation free 100 mm wafers are readily available. The SiC wafer roadmap looks very favorable as volume production takes off. For GaN materials the main application area is geared towards the lower power rating level up to 1 kV on mostly lateral FET designs. Power module demonstrations are beginning to appear in scientific reports and real applications. A short review is therefore given. Other advantages of SiC is the possibility of high temperature operation (>; 300\u00b0C) and in radiation hard environments, which could offer considerable system advantages.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5890778/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 May 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5890778/","dateOfInsertion":"01 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12217205","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"SiC power devices \u2014 Present status, applications and future perspective","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SiC power devices \u2014 Present status, applications and future perspective","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"031177.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.145234S","chronDate":"23-26 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871956","isNumber":"5890767","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871956","citationCount":"193","xplore-issue":"5890767","articleId":"5890778","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5890803,"authors":[{"name":"X.

Change in ON-state resistance is used as a precursor of failure due to its dependence on junction temperature.

The sensor was fabricated with the industrial standard CMOS process and the MEMS postprocessing step. Polyimide was used as the sensing material for its good linearity. To enlarge the depth of the recesses between the interdigital electrodes, the polysilicon heater was placed under the Al electrode and also the passivation between the interdigital electrodes was partly etched. As a result, thicker polyimide can be deposited between the Al electrodes and thus the sensitivity of the sensor can be improved. The etching resistant passivation between Al electrodes and polyimide was used to ensure the reliability of the sensor. To put it into practical use, the sensor was fully packaged, and by using the polysilicon heaters, both the hysteresis and the recovery time of the sensor could be greatly improved. The packaged humidity sensor was measured to show a good linearity and repeatability over the whole testing range.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/6046174/05892868.pdf","startPage":"2986","endPage":"2992","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2011.2154325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2011.2154325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6046174","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5892868","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fully Packaged CMOS Interdigital Capacitive Humidity Sensor With Polysilicon Heaters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Humidity","Polyimides","Electrodes","Heating","Sensors","Capacitance","Humidity measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitive sensors","CMOS integrated circuits","electrodes","elemental semiconductors","humidity sensors","microsensors","passivation","reliability","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fully packaged CMOS interdigital capacitive humidity sensor","polysilicon heaters","industrial standard CMOS process","MEMS postprocessing","polyimide","sensing material","interdigital electrodes","etching resistant passivation","Si"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Capacitive sensor","CMOS","humidity sensor","package","polyimide"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5892868/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"A Fully Packaged CMOS Interdigital Capacitive Humidity Sensor With Polysilicon Heaters","volume":"11","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5892868/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12300775","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fully Packaged CMOS Interdigital Capacitive Humidity Sensor With Polysilicon Heaters","sourcePdf":"jsen-huang-2154325-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082768S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6046174","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6046174","articleId":"5892868","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":5892872,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In practice, however, the signal itself is often subject to random noise prior to measurement. We briefly study this setting and show that, for the vast majority of measurement schemes employed in compressed sensing, the two models are equivalent with the important difference that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is divided by a factor proportional to p/n, where p is the dimension of the signal and n is the number of observations. Since p/n is often large, this leads to noise folding which can have a severe impact on the SNR.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2011.2159837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2011.2159837","endPage":"481","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5873694/05892874.pdf","startPage":"478","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Noise Folding in Compressed Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5892874/","displayDocTitle":"Noise Folding in Compressed Sensing","volume":"18","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"12082814","dateOfInsertion":"30 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5892874/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Folding in Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"lsp-ariascastro-2159837-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046136S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5873694","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"124","xplore-issue":"5873694","articleId":"5892874","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5892881,"authors":[{"name":"Hualiang Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Hualiang","lastName":"Li","id":"37293384900"},{"name":"Nicolle M.

It is particularly useful for the analysis of fMRI data in its native complex form since very little is known about the nature of phase. Phase information has been discarded in most analyses as it is particularly noisy. In this paper, we show that a complex ICA approach using a flexible nonlinearity that adapts to the source density is the more desirable one for performing ICA of complex fMRI data compared to those that use fixed nonlinearity, especially when noise level is high. By adaptively matching the underlying fMRI density model, the analysis performance can be improved in terms of both the estimation of spatial maps and the task-related time courses, especially for the estimation of phase of the time course. We also define a procedure for analysis and visualization of complex-valued fMRI results, which includes the construction of bivariate t-maps for multiple subjects and a complex-valued ICASSO scheme for evaluating the consistency of ICA algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5892881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","volume":"58","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"12230246","pubMedId":"21690000","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5892881/","dateOfInsertion":"19 September 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Application of Independent Component Analysis With Adaptive Density Model to Complex-Valued fMRI Data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Independent Component Analysis With Adaptive Density Model to Complex-Valued fMRI Data","sourcePdf":"tbme-li-2159841-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089832S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10","isNumber":"6021989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"6021989","articleId":"5892881","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5892884,"authors":[{"name":"Mahmoud Hamouda","affiliation":["ESSTT, SICISI, University of Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia","CRC-EECPE, Ecole de technologie sup\u00e9rieure, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6011706/5892884/5892884-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mahmoud Hamouda was born in Mahdia, Tunisia, in 1972.

The method consists in using the event-manager modules of the DSP to build specified pulses at its PWM output peripherals, which are fed to the digital input ports of a FPGA. Moreover, a simple logical processing and delay times are thereafter implemented in the FPGA so as to synthesize the suitable gate pulse patterns for the semiconductor-controlled devices. It is shown that the proposed implementation method enables high switching frequency operation with high pulse resolution as well as a negligible propagation time for the generation of the gating pulses.

The antecedent part of the TFS-SVMPC classifier is generated using an algorithm that is similar to fuzzy clustering. The dimension of the free parameter vector in the TS consequent part of the TFS-SVMPC is first reduced by principal component analysis (PCA). A linear SVM is then used to tune the subsequent parameters in the principal component space to give the system better generalization performance. The TFS-SVMPC is used as a classifier in a camera-based real-time object detection system. The object detection system consists of two stages. The first stage uses a color histogram of the global color appearance of an object as a detection feature for a TFS-SVMPC classifier. In particular, an efficient method for histogram extraction during the image scanning process is proposed for real-time implementation. The second stage uses the geometry-dependent local color appearance as a color feature for another TFS-SVMPC classifier. Comparisons with other types of classifiers and detection methods for the detection of different objects verify the performance of the proposed TFS-SVMPC-based detection method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5892887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12638408","volume":"59","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5892887/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2012","dateOfInsertion":"03 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A TS Fuzzy System Learned Through a Support Vector Machine in Principal Component Space for Real-Time Object Detection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A TS Fuzzy System Learned Through a Support Vector Machine in Principal Component Space for Real-Time Object Detection","sourcePdf":"tie-juang-2159949-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103357S","chronDate":"Aug.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6175217","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6175217","articleId":"5892887","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5892893,"authors":[{"name":"Sangjun Park","affiliation":["Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6287065/5892893/5892893-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Sangjun Park received the B.S. degree in aerospace information engineering from Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea, in 2010, where he is currently working toward the M.S. degree.","His current research interests include microinertial sensors, inertial sensor resonance control loop design and analysis, GNSS, and navigation systems."]},"firstName":"Sangjun","lastName":"Park","id":"38469287100"},{"name":"Jin Woo Song","affiliation":["Microinfinity Corporation Limited, Suwon, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3516/6287065/5892893/5892893-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Jin Woo Song received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2002.","He is the Chief Technical Officer of Microinfinity Corporation, Ltd., Seoul, Korea.

The design goal of the oscillation loop is simultaneously to stabilize the resonance characteristics of the sensor and to automatically track the resonant frequency in order to guarantee highly reliable sensor performance. To this end, the concept of automatic gain control (AGC) is applied so that the loop is designed to maintain the oscillation amplitude as one control objective. The second control objective is to achieve resonance condition tracking even when external influences such as disturbance and noise exist. For the verification of the proposed control loop design, an example resonant sensor system is modeled, and a control loop and controller that accompany the system are also designed. Finally, the proposed loop performance was demonstrated via simulations which consider practical noise elements. The theoretical results were further verified via sensor's transient responses and noise analysis.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oscillators","Resonant frequency","Sensors","Mathematical model","Noise","Gain control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","gain control","oscillations","sensors","transient response"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autonomous oscillation control loop design","amplitude controlled frequency read-out-type resonant sensors","automatic gain control","resonance condition tracking","transient responses","noise analysis"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Automatic gain control (AGC)","oscillation control","resonance condition","resonant sensor","tracking"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2011.2157352","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6287065/05892893.pdf","startPage":"1009","endPage":"1020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6287065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2011.2157352","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous Oscillation Control Loop Design for Amplitude Controlled, Frequency Read-Out-Type Resonant Sensors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5892893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Oscillation Control Loop Design for Amplitude Controlled, Frequency Read-Out-Type Resonant Sensors","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5892893/","volume":"17","issue":"6","publicationDate":"Dec. 2012","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5892893/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12961015","dateOfInsertion":"24 August 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Oscillation Control Loop Design for Amplitude Controlled, Frequency Read-Out-Type Resonant Sensors","sourcePdf":"tmech-sung-2157352-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.077208S","chronDate":"Dec.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6287065","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6287065","articleId":"5892893","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5892895,"authors":[{"name":"Jian Fu","affiliation":["School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China","Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/72/5937482/5892895/5892895-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jian Fu received the B.S. degree in industrial and electrical automation from Wuhan University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 1994, the M.S. degree in computer applications from Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, in 1999, and the Ph.D. degree in control theory and control engineering from the University of Science and Technology Beijing, Beijing, China, in 2006.","He is currently an Associate Professor at the School of Automation, Wuhan University of Technology.

Over the past decades, several generations of ADP design have been proposed in the literature, which have demonstrated many successful applications in various benchmarks and industrial applications. While many of the existing researches focus on multiple-inputs-single-output system with steepest descent search, in this paper we investigate a generalized multiple-input-multiple-output (GMIMO) ADP design for online learning and control, which is more applicable to a wide range of practical real-world applications. Furthermore, an improved weight-updating algorithm based on recursive Levenberg-Marquardt methods is presented and embodied in the GMIMO approach to improve its performance. Finally, we test the performance of this approach based on a practical complex system, namely, the learning and control of the tension and height of the looper system in a hot strip mill.

The relationship between junction temperature and turn-off time is explained by modeling the parasitic properties of an IGBT. A metric is derived from the model to standardize the relative estimates in junction temperature from measurements of turn-off time. To evaluate the effects preceding latch-up in-situ, seeded fault testing is conducted on a three-phase power inverter using aged transistors induced with a fault located in the die-attach solder layer.

Uncertainties may be managed through real options that provide a decision maker with the right, but not the obligation, to exercise actions in the future. While real options analysis has traditionally been used to quantify the value of such flexibility, this paper is motivated by the need for a structured approach to identify where real options are or can be embedded for uncertainty management. We introduce a logical model-based approach to identification of real option mechanisms and types, where the mechanism is the enabler of the option, while the type refers to the flexibility provided by the option. First, we extend the classical design structure matrix and the more general multiple-domain matrix (MDM), commonly used in modeling and analyzing interdependencies in complex socio-technical systems, to the more expressive Logical-MDM that supports the representation of flexibility. Second, we show that, in addition to flexibility, two new properties, namely, optionability and realizability, are relevant to the identification of real options. We use the Logical-MDM to estimate flexibility, optionability, and realizability metrics. Finally, we introduce the Real Options Identification (ROI) method based on these metrics, where the identified options are valued using standard real options valuation methods to support decision making under uncertainty. The expressivity of the logic combined with the structure of the dependency model allows the effective representation and identification of mechanisms and types of real options across multiple domains and lifecycle phases of a system. We demonstrate this approach through a series of unmanned air vehicle scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCA.2011.2157133","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics - Part A:

The CoopMAC I protocol proposed by Liu picks either a direct path or a relay path based on rate comparison to enhance average throughput and delay performances. However, its performance deteriorates under fading conditions due to lower direct path or relay path reliability. UtdMAC, which was proposed by Agarwal , performs better than CoopMAC I in terms of average throughput and delay performances due to improved transmission reliability provided by the backup relay path. Although it is better than CoopMAC I, UtdMAC does not fully benefit from higher throughput relay path (compared with the direct path) since it uses relay path only as a secondary backup path. In this paper, a new cooperative medium access control (MAC) protocol, which is termed the 2rcMAC protocol, is proposed for a small-sized network. The protocol makes use of two cooperating nodes to achieve superior throughput and delay performances, compared with the existing cooperative MAC protocols. The secondary relay path is invoked as a backup path for better transmission reliability and higher throughput through the relay path. Moreover, handshaking and single-bit feedbacks resolve contentions among relay nodes in proximity at the time and further provide the source node with rate information on source-to-destination, source-to-relay, and relay-to-destination links. Performance gains achieved by the 2rcMAC protocol under fast-fading conditions over the existing cooperative MAC protocols are compared and discussed. Simulation results clearly show an average throughput improvement of 7% and 25% and an average delay improvement of 94.8% and 98.9%, compared with UtdMAC and CoopMAC I, respectively.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5892902/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12219105","volume":"60","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5892902/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Two-Relay-Based Cooperative MAC Protocol for Wireless Ad hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Relay-Based Cooperative MAC Protocol for Wireless Ad hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-khalid-2159872-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071076S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5892902","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5892903,"authors":[{"name":"Sudhir S.

In the presence of increasing random intra-die variations, mismatch becomes a significant design challenge for circuits such as comparators. In this paper we describe and demonstrate the details of a statistical element selection (SES) methodology that relies on the combinatorial growth of subsets of selectable circuit elements (e.g., input transistors in a comparator) to provide redundancy for post-manufacturing calibration of specifications (e.g., offset). A test chip consisting of an array of digitally calibrated comparators with built-in combinatorial redundancy was manufactured in 65 nm bulk CMOS. Over 99.5% of the comparators satisfy the given offset specification compared to 15% for Pelgrom-type sizing. A second test chip in the same process consists of an 8-bit, 1.5 GS/s flash ADC and achieves 37 db SNDR at low frequencies. The total power is 35 mW, 20 mW in the S&H and 15 mW in the ADC core.

This emphasizes the need for a technology roadmap in order to address several key issues associated with the deployment of these systems. The present paper presents the results of the European project ICT-OMEGA road mapping effort for future HNS focusing on the most indicative and critical function, namely that of network extension. Taking into account the various social, economic and technological factors, three alternative technologies, namely the 802.11n, 60 GHz and Power Line Communications (PLC) have been ranked, using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Based on a number of expert surveys, the technology value of each solution is calculated.

Each serial AER (sAER) link uses four wires: a micro strip pair for low voltage differential signaling (LVDS) and two handshaking lines. Each event is represented by a 32-bit word. Two extra preamble bits are used for alignment. Transmission clock is embedded in the data using Manchester encoding. As opposed to conventional LVDS links, the presented approach allows to stop physical communication between data events, so that no \u201ccomma\u201d characters need to be transmitted during these pauses. As soon as a new event needs to be transmitted, the link recovers immediately thanks to a built-in control voltage memorization circuit. As a result, power consumption of the serializer and deserializer circuits is proportional to data event rate. The approach is also highly tolerant to clock jitter, due to the asynchronous nature and the Manchester encoding. A chip test prototype has been fabricated in standard 0.35 \u03bcm CMOS including a pair of Serializer and Deserializer circuits. Maximum measured event transmission rate is 15 Meps (mega events per second) for 32-bit events, with a maximum bit transmission speed of 670 Mbps (mega bits per second).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5892911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2011","accessionNumber":"12328158","htmlLink":"/document/5892911/","displayDocTitle":"An Instant-Startup Jitter-Tolerant Manchester-Encoding Serializer/Deserializer Scheme for Event-Driven Bit-Serial LVDS Interchip AER Links","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Instant-Startup Jitter-Tolerant Manchester-Encoding Serializer/Deserializer Scheme for Event-Driven Bit-Serial LVDS Interchip AER Links","sourcePdf":"tcsi-linaresbarranco-2151070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.174586S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"6059687","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6059687","articleId":"5892911","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5892913,"authors":[{"name":"Youngmin Park","affiliation":["University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/5934463/5892913/5892913-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Youngmin Park (S'07) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from the Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2005, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2007, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree.","In Summer 2007, he held an internship position with the Memory Division at Samsung Electronics, Hwasung, Korea.

Correcting random errors of RS codes have been extensively studied in both academia and industry. However, for burst-error correction, the research is still quite limited due to its ultra high computation complexity. In this brief, starting from a recent theoretical work, a low-complexity reformulated inversionless burst-error correcting (RiBC) algorithm is developed for practical applications. Then, based on the proposed algorithm, a unified VLSI architecture that is capable of correcting burst errors, as well as random errors and erasures, is firstly presented for multi-mode decoding requirements. This new architecture is denoted as unified hybrid decoding (UHD) architecture. It will be shown that, being the first RS decoder owning enhanced burst-error correcting capability, it can achieve significantly improved error correcting capability than traditional hard-decision decoding (HDD) design.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2154369","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2154369","startPage":"1346","endPage":"1350","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6210451/05892920.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6210451","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unified Architecture for Reed-Solomon Decoder Combined With Burst-Error Correction","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5892920/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Unified Architecture for Reed-Solomon Decoder Combined With Burst-Error Correction","volume":"20","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2012","accessionNumber":"12769232","publicationDate":"July 2012","htmlLink":"/document/5892920/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified Architecture for Reed-Solomon Decoder Combined With Burst-Error Correction","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yuan-2154369-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123757S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6210451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6210451","articleId":"5892920","onlineDate":"16 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5892989,"authors":[{"name":"Pengnian Yang","affiliation":["College of Water Conservancy and Civil Engineering, Xinjang Agriculture University, Urumqi, 830052, China"],"firstName":"Pengnian","lastName":"Yang"},{"name":"Wu Wenqiang","affiliation":["China Institute of Water Resource and Hydropower Research, Beijing, China","China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Rsearch, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Wu Wenqiang","id":"38020427800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-340-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5892989","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rivers","Transportation","Vegetation","Reservoirs","Monitoring","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["environmental monitoring (geophysics)","groundwater","numerical analysis","rivers","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["groundwater response width","intermittent water transportation","restoration area prediction","Populus euphratica","Tarim river","Xinjiang","China","Green Corridor","Taklimakan desert","Kumtag desert","Daxihaizi reservoir","groundwater table","AD 2000 05","groundwater monitoring section","Yingsu village","monitoring data","groundwater numerical model","Processing Modflow","size 4.0 km","size 6.525 km"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["groundwater","Populus euphratica","Modflow","lower reaches of Tarim River"]}],"abstract":"The Tarim River is the longest continental river in China, and the \u201cGreen Corridor\u201d is located in its lower reaches between the Taklimakan Desert (the second largest mobile desert in the world) and the Kumtag Desert. Populus euphratica is the only arbor in the \u201cGreen Corridor\u201d and it has a significant effect in conserving and improving the ecology and environment in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. When Daxihaizi Reservoir was built in 1972, the length of 320km riverway in lower reaches of Tarim River had no flow. Groundwater table decreased continually since then. Along with water transportation again from the MAY 2000, groundwater table is beginning to rise. The groundwater monitoring section located in Yingsu village and has a distance of 61km to Daxihaizi Reservoir. This article based on the monitoring data of Yingsu section from the first to the seventh water transportation and then the groundwater numerical model was established by Processing Modflow. Length and width of the model is 4.0km and 6.525km respectively. The process of groundwater response was simulated well again. In addition, the author made a forecast of ten years under intermittent water transportation. The results showed that the transverse respond range of the groundwater will be 3km from the river bank. As a whole, the water transportation has the significant role to the restoration of Populus euphratica. The author analyses the relationship between volume of water transportation and the area of Populus euphratica in historical times. In the end, the restorable area of Populus euphratica below the Daxaihai Reservoir is forecasted on the condition of intermittent water transportation.","doi":"10.1109/ISWREP.2011.5892989","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Water Resource and Environmental Protection","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Water Resource and Environmental Protection","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871806/5892931/05892989.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"241","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5892931","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWREP.2011.5892989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The groundwater respond width after intermittent water transportation and restoration area prediction of Populus euphratica in the lower reaches of Tarim River, Xinjiang","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5892989","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"The groundwater respond width after intermittent water transportation and restoration area prediction of Populus euphratica in the lower reaches of Tarim River, Xinjiang","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5892989/","publicationDate":"May 2011","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12070277","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5892989/","volume":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The groundwater respond width after intermittent water transportation and restoration area prediction of Populus euphratica in the lower reaches of Tarim River, Xinjiang","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"00580856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.124147S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871806","isNumber":"5892931","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871806","xplore-issue":"5892931","articleId":"5892989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5893423,"authors":[{"name":"Benzhi Zhou","affiliation":["Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Fuyang, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Benzhi","lastName":"Zhou","id":"38021654500"},{"name":"Mukui Yu","affiliation":["Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Fuyang, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Mukui Yu","id":"38022525100"},{"name":"Yonghui Cao","affiliation":["Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Fuyang, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yonghui","lastName":"Cao","id":"38023528800"},{"name":"Xiaoming Wang","affiliation":["Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Fuyang, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoming","lastName":"Wang","id":"38026562300"},{"name":"Honggang Sun","affiliation":["Research Institute of Subtropical Forestry, Chinese Academy of Forestry, Fuyang, Zhejiang, China"],"lastName":"Honggang Sun","id":"38023784900"},{"name":"Chang Ai","affiliation":["Office of Forest Resources Supervision and Administration, State Forestry Administration, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Chang Ai","id":"38019992400"},{"name":"Lianhong Gu","affiliation":["Environmental Sciences Division, Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Lianhong","lastName":"Gu","id":"38017828000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-340-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-339-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-61284-338-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5893423","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5893423","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ice","Storms","Vegetation","Forestry","Snow","Ecosystems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric boundary layer","storms","surveying","topography (Earth)","vegetation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AD 2008","ice storm","China forest","site specific survey","masson pine","Chinese fir","bamboo plantation","topographical variable","stand density","tree size","tree age","large scale forestation","forest resources","nontimber goods","subtropical forest"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["extreme event","ice storm","China","forest"]}],"abstract":"An unprecedented ice storm occurred in south China in early 2008, bringing extensive damages and huge losses to China's forests. By site specific survey, coupled with review of the government documents and reports, we made an impact assessment of the ice storm on China's forests at regional and local scale. The ice storm affected one-tenth of the forests in 19 provinces, with masson pine, Chinese fir and bamboo plantation among the most extensively slashed. The damage degree for the subtropical typical forest types ranged from 25% to 66%. Ice-damage to tree/bamboo exhibited different patterns, with uprooting and bending being the most common. The topographical variables (altitude, slope aspect), stand density, tree size and age, and management practice were all found to have effects on damage severity. High altitude and north-faced slope aggravated ice damage; native pine exhibited better resistance to damage than exotic. The effect of stand age and tree size on damage seemed to vary with species. The ice storm taught us valuable lessons. Native species should be put at the most priority in large scale forestation. Good management practice may help to reduce the risk of extreme climatic events. Sustainable extraction of non-timber goods is essential to planning for the risk of extreme events in forest resources use.","doi":"10.1109/ISWREP.2011.5893423","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISWREP.2011.5893423","startPage":"2652","endPage":"2656","publicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Water Resource and Environmental Protection","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Symposium on Water Resource and Environmental Protection","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871806/5893368/05893423.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5893368","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of the 2008 ice storm on China's forests","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893423/","conferenceDate":"20-22 May 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Impact of the 2008 ice storm on China's forests","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12083191","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5893423/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of the 2008 ice storm on China's forests","confLoc":"Xi'an, China","sourcePdf":"06700696.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049961S","chronDate":"20-22 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871806","isNumber":"5893368","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871806","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5893368","articleId":"5893423","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5893782,"authors":[{"name":"Juan Pablo D Amato","firstName":"Juan Pablo","lastName":"D Amato"},{"name":"Cristian Garcia Bauza","firstName":"Cristian","lastName":"Garcia Bauza"},{"name":"Gustavo Boroni","firstName":"Gustavo","lastName":"Boroni"}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-0992"}],"articleNumber":"5893782","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":613},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Region 9","url":"http://www.ewh.ieee.org/reg/9/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Java","Mobile communication","Databases","Sun","Wireless communication","Servers","Personal digital assistants"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Agriculture","Image color analisys","Object detection","Parallel processing"]}],"abstract":"In fruit packaging companies, the color is a metric used to determine the fruit quality, maturation, healthiness, etc..

Its importance originates from its applicability in many fields such as system health monitoring, event detection in sensor networks, and detecting eco-system disturbances, etc. In detecting anomalous subsequences from data streams, the main challenge for the existing techniques is to determine the lengths of the normal and anomalous subsequences and thus creating a robust model for detecting the anomalous subsequences. In this paper, we propose an incremental algorithm based on the dynamic time warping technique to detect anomalous subsequences in data streams. The proposed algorithm works with relaxed constrains regarding the lengths of normal and/or the anomalous subsequences. That is the proposed algorithm is able to detect variable length anomalous subsequences from among variable length normal sequences. The proposed algorithm can extract variable length anomalies with linear cost of time and memory.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784215/5893793/05893836.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"302","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2011.5893836","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2011.5893836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5893793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5893836","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Searching data streams for variable length anomalies","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis","Data mining","Nearest neighbor searches","Arrays","Time series analysis","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","learning (artificial intelligence)","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data streams","variable length anomalies","system health monitoring","event detection","eco-system disturbances","anomalous subsequences","incremental algorithm","dynamic time warping technique","data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","outliers","data stream","data mining","extracting subsequences","incremental algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Searching data streams for variable length anomalies","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5893836/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"12063682","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Searching data streams for variable length anomalies","confLoc":"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates","sourcePdf":"p297abusafia.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07819S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5784215","isNumber":"5893793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784215","xplore-issue":"5893793","articleId":"5893836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5893851,"authors":[{"name":"Baker Mohammad","affiliation":["Technology and Research, Khalifa University for Science, Abu Dhabi, UAE"],"firstName":"Baker","lastName":"Mohammad","id":"37574033300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0314-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0311-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-0313-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5893851","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1268},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low leakage power SRAM cell for embedded memory","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784215/5893793/05893851.pdf","startPage":"367","endPage":"370","publicationTitle":"2011 International Conference on Innovations in Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2011.5893851","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5893793","doi":"10.1109/INNOVATIONS.2011.5893851","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radio frequency","Variable speed drives","CMOS technology","Random access memory","Logic gates","Arrays","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power electronics","SRAM chips","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low leakage power SRAM cell","embedded memory","array architecture","low power embedded memory","novel 7-transistor","6-transistor SRAM cell","low power process technology"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CMOS Memory Integrated Circuits","Low power VLSI circuit design","Register File","SRAM cell design"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5893851","abstract":"Leakage power becomes big percentage of total active power especially for small geometry CMOS technology.

By contrast, the MIMO capacity increases linearly with the number of transmit antennas, provided that the number of receive antennas is equal to the number of transmit antennas. With the further proviso that the total transmit power is increased proportionately to the number of transmit antennas, a linear capacity increase is achieved upon increasing the transmit power, which justifies the spectacular success of MIMOs. Hence we may argue that MIMO-aided transceivers and their cooperation-assisted distributed or virtual MIMO counterparts constitute power-efficient solutions. In a nutshell, since the conception of GSM in excess of three orders of magnitude bit-rate improvements were achieved in three decades, which corresponds to about a factor ten for each decade, because GSM had a data rate of 9.6 Kb/s, while HSDPA is capable of communicating at 13.7 Mb/s. However, the possible transmit power reductions remained more limited, even when using the most advanced multistage iterative detectors, since the required received signal power has not been reduced by as much as 30 dB. This plausible observation motivates the further research of advanced cooperation-aided wireless MIMO transceivers, as detailed in this treatise.","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2011.2148150","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5958172/05893900.pdf","startPage":"1343","endPage":"1385","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5958172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2011.2148150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Near-Capacity Wireless Transceivers and Cooperative Communications in the MIMO Era: Evolution of Standards, Waveform Design, and Future Perspectives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5893900","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Near-Capacity Wireless Transceivers and Cooperative Communications in the MIMO Era: Evolution of Standards, Waveform Design, and Future Perspectives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893900/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"18 July 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12117733","volume":"99","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Near-Capacity Wireless Transceivers and Cooperative Communications in the MIMO Era: Evolution of Standards, Waveform Design, and Future Perspectives","sourcePdf":"jproc-hanzo-2148150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.211335S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","isNumber":"5958172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"56","articleId":"5893900","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5893909,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Wang","id":"37965528100"},{"name":"Mengqing Yuan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Mengqing","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37683846200"},{"name":"Tian Xiao","affiliation":["Wave Computation Technologies, Inc., Durham, NC, USA"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Xiao","id":"37275959300"},{"name":"William T.

To date, a family of subgradient algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem under general convexity assumptions. This technical note shows that, for the scalar case and by assuming a bit more, novel non-gradient-based algorithms with appealing features can be constructed. Specifically, we develop Pairwise Equalizing (PE) and Pairwise Bisectioning (PB), two gossip algorithms that solve unconstrained, separable, convex consensus optimization problems over undirected networks with time-varying topologies, where each local function is strictly convex, continuously differentiable, and has a minimizer. We show that PE and PB are easy to implement, bypass limitations of the subgradient algorithms, and produce switched, nonlinear, networked dynamical systems that admit a common Lyapunov function and asymptotically converge. Moreover, PE generalizes the well-known Pairwise Averaging and Randomized Gossip Algorithm, while PB relaxes a requirement of PE, allowing nodes to never share their local functions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/9/6094240/05893921.pdf","startPage":"2917","endPage":"2923","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2011.2160020","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2011.2160020","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6094240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5893921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gossip Algorithms for Convex Consensus Optimization Over Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heuristic algorithms","Convergence","Lyapunov methods","Spread spectrum communication","Algorithm design and analysis","Convex functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","gradient methods","network theory (graphs)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gossip algorithms","convex consensus optimization","subgradient algorithms","convexity assumptions","nongradient based algorithms","pairwise equalizing","PE","pairwise bisectioning","PB","time-varying topologies","Lyapunov function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed consensus","distributed convex optimization","gossip algorithms","networked dynamical systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Gossip Algorithms for Convex Consensus Optimization Over Networks","volume":"56","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5893921/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","accessionNumber":"12404007","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gossip Algorithms for Convex Consensus Optimization Over Networks","sourcePdf":"tac-tang-2160020-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.159838S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"6094240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6094240","articleId":"5893921","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5893932,"authors":[{"name":"Farnood Merrikh-Bayat","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6087321/5893932/5893932-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farnood Merrikh-Bayat received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from the Khaje Nasir Toosi University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2005 and the M.Sc. degree in digital electronic from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include memresistors, memristive neuro-fuzzy systems, and brain emulation that is based on memristor crossbar structures."]},"firstName":"Farnood","lastName":"Merrikh-Bayat","id":"38368315900"},{"name":"Saeed Bagheri Shouraki","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/91/6087321/5893932/5893932-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Saeed Bagheri Shouraki received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the M.Sc. degree in digital electronics from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1985 and 1987, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in fuzzy control systems from Tsushin Daigaku (University of Electro-Communications), Tokyo, Japan, in 2000.","He joined the Computer Engineering Department, Sharif University of Technology, as a Faculty Member, and was there until 2008.

IDS, as a pattern-based processing unit, extracts useful information from a system that is subjected to modeling. In spite of its excellent potential to solve problems such as classification and modeling compared with other soft-computing tools, finding its simple and fast hardware implementation is still a challenge. This paper describes a new hardware implementation of the IDS method that is based on the memristor crossbar structure. In addition to simplicity, being completely real time, having low latency, and the ability to continue working properly after the occurrence of power failure are some of the advantages of our proposed circuit. Moreover, some of operations in the IDS method have fuzzy nature, and as we will show at the end of this paper, updation of rules in the IDS structure and spiky neural networks are very similar. Therefore, IDS can be considered as a new fuzzy implementation of artificial spiky neural networks as well.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893932/","volume":"19","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5893932/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12388797","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"28 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Memristor Crossbar-Based Hardware Implementation of the IDS Method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memristor Crossbar-Based Hardware Implementation of the IDS Method","sourcePdf":"tfuzz-merrikhbayat-2160024-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069726S","chronDate":"Dec.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"91","isNumber":"6087321","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"91","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6087321","articleId":"5893932","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5893936,"authors":[{"name":"Tatsuya Hosoi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, Ishikawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6146784/5893936/5893936-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tatsuya Hosoi received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Kanazawa Institute of Technology, Ishikawa, Japan, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the M.Eng. degree."]},"firstName":"Tatsuya","lastName":"Hosoi","id":"37605847300"},{"name":"Hiroya Watanabe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, Ishikawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6146784/5893936/5893936-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Hiroya Watanabe received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Kanazawa Institute of Technology, Ishikawa, Japan, in 2009, where he is currently working toward the M.Eng. degree."]},"firstName":"Hiroya","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37589451500"},{"name":"Kazuo Shima","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, Ishikawa, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6146784/5893936/5893936-photo-3-source-small.gif","p":["Kazuo Shima (M'97) received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering from Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan, in 1993 and 1995, respectively, and the Dr.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan, in 2004.","Since 2005, he has been with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Kanazawa Institute of Technology, Ishikawa, Japan, where he is currently an Assistant Professor.

The PM effect of increasing the output power and the terminal voltage has already been confirmed by finite element analysis (FEA) and experiments under steady states. In this paper, demagnetization in the PMs due to sudden three-phase short circuits is evaluated by FEA. The results show that irreversible demagnetization arises in the PMs of a PMa-SM with relatively smaller circumferential PM length. Effects of the PM shape and damper bars on the irreversible demagnetization are also investigated. The results show that making the PM shape a rectangle and adding damper bars on the outer surfaces of the PMs are effective to reduce the demagnetization, while increasing the number of the conventional damper bars is not effective.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5893936/","dateOfInsertion":"09 February 2012","publicationDate":"June 2012","accessionNumber":"12801655","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Demagnetization Analysis of Additional Permanent Magnets in Salient-Pole Synchronous Machines With Damper Bars Under Sudden Short Circuits","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demagnetization Analysis of Additional Permanent Magnets in Salient-Pole Synchronous Machines With Damper Bars Under Sudden Short Circuits","sourcePdf":"tie-shima-2159956-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08528S","chronDate":"June  2012","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"6146784","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6146784","articleId":"5893936","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5893937,"authors":[{"name":"Zhuoran Zhang","affiliation":["Jiangsu Key Laboratory of New Energy Generation and Power Conversion, College of Automation Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6146784/5893937/5893937-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhuoran Zhang (M'09) was born in Anhui, China, in 1978.

For strong recovery, the threshold strictly decreases from 0.5 to 0.239 as p increases from 0 to 1.

Our bound of strong recovery improves on the existing bounds when a is large. In particular, regarding the recovery threshold, this paper argues that \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-minimization has a higher threshold with smaller p for strong recovery; the threshold is the same for all p for sectional recovery; and \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n -minimization can outperform \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n-minimization for weak recovery.

The algorithms of LDA usually perform well under the following two assumptions. The first assumption is that the global data structure is consistent with the local data structure. The second assumption is that the input data classes are Gaussian distributions. However, in real-world applications, these assumptions are not always satisfied. In this paper, we propose an improved LDA framework, the local LDA (LLDA), which can perform well without needing to satisfy the above two assumptions. Our LLDA framework can effectively capture the local structure of samples. According to different types of local data structure, our LLDA framework incorporates several different forms of linear feature extraction approaches, such as the classical LDA and principal component analysis. The proposed framework includes two LLDA algorithms: a vector-based LLDA algorithm and a matrix-based LLDA (MLLDA) algorithm. MLLDA is directly applicable to image recognition, such as face recognition. Our algorithms need to train only a small portion of the whole training set before testing a sample. They are suitable for learning large-scale databases especially when the input data dimensions are very high and can achieve high classification accuracy. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithms can obtain good classification results.","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2011.2152852","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2011.2152852","startPage":"1119","endPage":"1132","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/5937482/05893948.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5937482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local Linear Discriminant Analysis Framework Using Sample Neighbors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Local Linear Discriminant Analysis Framework Using Sample Neighbors","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"05 July 2011","volume":"22","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5893948/","accessionNumber":"12141544","pubMedId":"21693417","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893948/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local Linear Discriminant Analysis Framework Using Sample Neighbors","sourcePdf":"tnn-fan-2152852-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111103S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"5937482","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"130","xplore-issue":"5937482","articleId":"5893948","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5893952,"authors":[{"name":"George K.

Our objective is to devise strategies for scheduling the sensors to optimize the tradeoff between tracking performance and energy consumption. We cast the scheduling problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where the control actions correspond to the set of sensors to activate at each time step. Using a bottom-up approach, we consider different sensing, motion and cost models with increasing levels of difficulty. At the first level, the sensing regions of the different sensors do not overlap and the target is only observed within the sensing range of an active sensor. Then, we consider sensors with overlapping sensing range such that the tracking error, and hence the actions of the different sensors, are tightly coupled. Finally, we consider scenarios wherein the target locations and sensors' observations assume values on continuous spaces. Exact solutions are generally intractable even for the simplest models due to the dimensionality of the information and action spaces. Hence, we devise approximate solution techniques, and in some cases derive lower bounds on the optimal tradeoff curves. The generated scheduling policies, albeit suboptimal, often provide close-to-optimal energy-tracking tradeoffs.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2160055","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6017237/05893952.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2160055","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017237","startPage":"4923","endPage":"4937","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sensor Scheduling for Energy-Efficient Target Tracking in Sensor Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5893952","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sensor Scheduling for Energy-Efficient Target Tracking in Sensor Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893952/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12227865","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5893952/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensor Scheduling for Energy-Efficient Target Tracking in Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-atia-2160055-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088567S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6017237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"6017237","articleId":"5893952","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5893953,"authors":[{"name":"Chaitanya Ekanadham","affiliation":["Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (CIMS), New York University, New York, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6017237/5893953/5893953-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chaitanya Ekanadham received the B.S. degree in mathematical/computational sciences and symbolic systems from Stanford University, Stanford, CA, in 2007.

Although these constituents are drawn from a continuous family, most current signal decomposition methods rely on a finite dictionary of discrete examples selected from this family (e.g., shifted copies of a set of basic waveforms), and apply sparse optimization methods to select and solve for the relevant coefficients. Here, we generate a dictionary that includes auxiliary interpolation functions that approximate translates of features via adjustment of their coefficients. We formulate a constrained convex optimization problem, in which the full set of dictionary coefficients represents a linear approximation of the signal, the auxiliary coefficients are constrained so as to only represent translated features, and sparsity is imposed on the primary coefficients using an L1 penalty. The basis pursuit denoising (BP) method may be seen as a special case, in which the auxiliary interpolation functions are omitted, and we thus refer to our methodology as continuous basis pursuit (CBP). We develop two implementations of CBP for a one-dimensional translation-invariant source, one using a first-order Taylor approximation, and another using a form of trigonometric spline. We examine the tradeoff between sparsity and signal reconstruction accuracy in these methods, demonstrating empirically that trigonometric CBP substantially outperforms Taylor CBP, which, in turn, offers substantial gains over ordinary BP. In addition, the CBP bases can generally achieve equally good or better approximations with much coarser sampling than BP, leading to a reduction in dictionary dimensionality.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5893953","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Dictionaries","Linear approximation","Mathematical model","Noise measurement","Electronic mail","Adaptation model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convex programming","interpolation","signal denoising","signal reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse translation-invariant signals","continuous basis pursuit","signal decomposition","transformation-invariance","sparse optimization","auxiliary interpolation functions","convex optimization","dictionary coefficients","auxiliary coefficients","L1 penalty","basis pursuit denoising","first-order Taylor approximation","trigonometric spline","signal reconstruction accuracy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Basis pursuit","feature decomposition","interpolation","L1 optimization","sparsity","transformation-invariance"]}],"publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/6017237/05893953.pdf","startPage":"4735","endPage":"4744","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2011.2160058","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2011.2160058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovery of Sparse Translation-Invariant Signals With Continuous Basis Pursuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893953/","displayDocTitle":"Recovery of Sparse Translation-Invariant Signals With Continuous Basis Pursuit","isDynamicHtml":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12227866","pubMedId":"24352562","htmlLink":"/document/5893953/","volume":"59","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery of Sparse Translation-Invariant Signals With Continuous Basis Pursuit","sourcePdf":"tsp-ekanadham-2160058-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099766S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6017237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"140","xplore-issue":"6017237","articleId":"5893953","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5893954,"authors":[{"name":"Shay Maymon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6017237/5893954/5893954-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shay Maymon (M'11) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering and the M.Sc. degree from Tel-Aviv University (TAU), Tel-Aviv, Israel, in 199 and 1999, respectively.","Following six years' military service as an R&D Engineer in a leading technological unit of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in the Digital Signal Processing Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge.

However, reconstruction of the continuous-time signal from nonuniform samples is typically more difficult to implement than from uniform samples. Motivated by the fact that sinc interpolation results in perfect reconstruction for uniform sampling, we develop a class of approximate reconstruction methods from nonuniform samples based on the use of time-invariant lowpass filtering, i.e., sinc interpolation. The methods discussed consist of four cases incorporated in a single framework. The case of sub-Nyquist sampling is also discussed and nonuniform sampling is shown as a possible approach to mitigating the impact of aliasing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893954/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5893954/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12227867","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Sinc Interpolation of Nonuniform Samples","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sinc Interpolation of Nonuniform Samples","sourcePdf":"tsp-maymon-2160054-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07363S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6017237","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"6017237","articleId":"5893954","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":5893955,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Akcakaya","affiliation":["Washington University of Saint Louis, Saint Louis, MO, USA","ARCON Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6017237/5893955/5893955-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Murat Ak\u00e7akaya (S'07) received the B.Sc. in electrical and electronics engineering department (in communications and electromagnetics) of Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, in 2005 and the M.Sc. and the Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, MO, in May and December 2010, respectively.","He is currently a Staff Engineer at ARCON Corporation, Waltham, MA, working on air traffic control systems and target tracking.

The female Ormia is able to locate male crickets' call accurately, for reproduction purposes, despite the small distance between its ears compared with the incoming wavelength. This phenomenon has been explained by the mechanical coupling between the Ormia's ears, modeled by a pair of differential equations. In this paper, we first solve the differential equations governing the Ormia ochracea's ear response, and convert the response to the prespecified radio frequencies. Using the converted response, we then implement the biologically inspired coupling as a multi-input multi-output filter on a uniform linear antenna array output. We derive the maximum likelihood estimates of source DOAs, and compute the corresponding Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound on the DOA estimation error as a performance measure.

The selection criterion depends on the detector used at the receiver. For the maximum-likelihood detector, the criterion is to maximize the free distance. However, an exhaustive search is required to derive the distance, and the computational complexity can be prohibitively high. To avoid the exhaustive search, a lower bound of the free distance derived with the singular value decomposition (SVD) was then developed. This bound only involves the smallest singular value of the channel matrix, and its maximization can easily be conducted. An alternative lower bound of the free distance with the QR decomposition (QRD) was also derived in the literature. In this paper, we first propose a QRD-based selection method maximizing the lower bound. With some matrix properties, we theoretically prove that the lower bound yielded by the QRD is tighter than that by the SVD. We then propose a basis transformation method so that the lower bound yielded by the QRD can further be tightened. As a result, the QRD-based selection method can achieve near optimum performance. Finally, we extend the use of the proposed methods to other applications, such as receive antenna selection, joint transmit/receive antenna selection, and antenna selection in MIMO relay systems. Simulations show that the proposed selection methods can significantly outperform existing methods.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2160003","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05893956.pdf","startPage":"3178","endPage":"3191","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2160003","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QRD-Based Antenna Selection for ML Detection of Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Systems: Algorithms and Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5893956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893956/","displayDocTitle":"QRD-Based Antenna Selection for ML Detection of Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Systems: Algorithms and Applications","volume":"60","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219106","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5893956/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QRD-Based Antenna Selection for ML Detection of Spatial Multiplexing MIMO Systems: Algorithms and Applications","sourcePdf":"tvt-lin-2160003-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.084793S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5893956","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5893957,"authors":[{"name":"Debopriyo Chowdhury","affiliation":["Berkeley Wireless Research Center, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5959263/5893957/5893957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Debopriyo Chowdhury (M'10) received the B.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2010, both in electrical engineering.","He is currently a Staff Scientist with Broadcom Corporation, San Diego, CA, working on next-generation mobile wireless solutions.

The wordblocks include registers and lookup tables (LUTs) which can implement fixed point operations efficiently. We employ common subgraph extraction to determine the best mix of blocks within an FPU and study the area, speed and utilization tradeoff over a set of floating point benchmark circuits. We then explore the system impact of FPU density and flexibility in terms of area, speed, and routing resources. Finally, we derive an optimized coarse-grained FPU by considering both architectural and system-level issues. This proposed methodology can be used to evaluate a variety of FPU architecture optimizations. The results for the selected FPU architecture optimization show that although high density FPUs are slower, they have the advantages of improved area, area-delay product, and throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2153883","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6210451/05893965.pdf","startPage":"1295","endPage":"1303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2011.2153883","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6210451","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5893965","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing Floating Point Units in Hybrid FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5893965/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing Floating Point Units in Hybrid FPGAs","volume":"20","issue":"7","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5893965/","publicationDate":"July 2012","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"01 June 2012","accessionNumber":"12769233","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing Floating Point Units in Hybrid FPGAs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yu-2153883-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094008S","chronDate":"July  2012","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6210451","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6210451","articleId":"5893965","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5895033,"authors":[{"name":"Brooks D.

This system uses custom sparse array transducers built on flexible multilayer circuits that can be positioned for simultaneous imaging through both temporal acoustic windows, allowing for potential registration of multiple real-time 3-D scans of cerebral vasculature. We examine hardware considerations for new matrix arrays-transducer design and interconnects-in this application. Specifically, it is proposed that SNR may be increased by reducing the length of probe cables. This claim is evaluated as part of the presented system through simulation, experimental data, and in vivo imaging. Ultimately, gains in SNR of 7 dB are realized by replacing a standard probe cable with a much shorter flex interconnect; higher gains may be possible using ribbon-based probe cables. In vivo images are presented, showing cerebral arteries with and without the use of microbubble contrast agent; they have been registered and fused using a simple algorithm which maximizes normalized cross-correlation.","doi":"10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel5/58/5895015/05895033.pdf","startPage":"1189","endPage":"1202","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TUFFC.2011.1929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895015","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The ultrasound brain helmet: new transducers and volume registration for in vivo simultaneous multi-transducer 3-D transcranial imaging","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5895033","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895033/","displayDocTitle":"The ultrasound brain helmet: new transducers and volume registration for in vivo simultaneous multi-transducer 3-D transcranial imaging","volume":"58","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2011","accessionNumber":"12068843","pubMedId":"21693401","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5895033/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The ultrasound brain helmet: new transducers and volume registration for in vivo simultaneous multi-transducer 3-D transcranial imaging","sourcePdf":"t1161189.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124593S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"58","isNumber":"5895015","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5895015","articleId":"5895033","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5895041,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew S.

Specially, these include 1) identical packets must be delivered successfully to several nodes, 2) outage at any receiver requires the packet to be retransmitted at least to that receiver, and 3) the multicast rate is dominated by the receiver with the weakest link in order to minimize outage and retransmission. A first contribution of this paper is the development of a tractable multicast model and throughput metric that captures each of these key traits in a multicast wireless network. We utilize a Poisson cluster process (PCP) consisting of a distinct Poisson point process (PPP) for the transmitters and receivers, and then define the multicast transmission capacity (MTC) as the maximum achievable multicast rate per transmission attempt times the maximum intensity of multicast clusters under decoding delay and multicast outage constraints. A multicast cluster is a contiguous area over which a packet is multicasted, and to reduce outage it can be tessellated into \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">v</i>\n smaller regions of multicast. The second contribution of the paper is the analysis of several key aspects of this model, for which we develop the following main result.

We assume that the distribution of bursts is invariant under cyclic shifts and that the burst-length statistics are known. In analogy with rate-distortion theory, we wish to find frames of a given size, which minimize the mean-square reconstruction error for the encoding of vectors in a complex finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We obtain an upper bound for the mean-square reconstruction error for a given Parseval frame and in the case of cyclic Parseval frames, we find a family of frames which minimizes this upper bound. Under certain conditions, these minimizers are identical to complex Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes discussed in the literature. The accuracy of our upper bounds for the mean-square error is substantiated by complementary lower bounds. All estimates are based on convexity arguments and a discrete rearrangement inequality.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2146150","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895054.pdf","startPage":"4622","endPage":"4635","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2146150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Burst Erasures and the Mean-Square Error for Cyclic Parseval Frames","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5895054","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Burst Erasures and the Mean-Square Error for Cyclic Parseval Frames","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895054/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12063239","volume":"57","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Burst Erasures and the Mean-Square Error for Cyclic Parseval Frames","sourcePdf":"tit-bodmann-2146150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062798S","chronDate":"July  2011","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5895054","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":5895058,"authors":[{"name":"Shashi Kiran Chilappagari","affiliation":["Marvell Semiconductor, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona Tucson, Tucson, AZ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Shashi Kiran Chilappagari (S'05\u2013M'09) received the B.Tech. and M.Tech. degrees in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, India, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Arizona, Tucson, in 2008.","He was a Research Engineer in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Arizona, from January 2009 to December 2009.

An outage probability analysis for discrete constellations shows that full diversity can be achieved only when the coding rate does not exceed a maximum value that depends on the level of cooperation. We derive a new code structure by extending the previously published full-diversity root-LDPC code, designed for the BF point-to-point channel, to exhibit a rate-compatibility property which is necessary for coded cooperation. We estimate the asymptotic performance through a new density evolution analysis and the word error rate performance is determined for finite length codes. We show that our code construction exhibits near-outage limit performance for all block lengths and for a range of coding rates up to 0.5, which is the highest possible coding rate for two cooperating users.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2145470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2145470","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895062.pdf","startPage":"4202","endPage":"4218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Density Graph Codes for Coded Cooperation on Slow Fading Relay Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895062/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Low-Density Graph Codes for Coded Cooperation on Slow Fading Relay Channels","volume":"57","issue":"7","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12063246","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5895062/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Density Graph Codes for Coded Cooperation on Slow Fading Relay Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-duyck-2145470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097984S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"21","xplore-issue":"5895044","articleId":"5895062","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5895063,"authors":[{"name":"Tuvi Etzion","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"bio":{"p":["Tuvi Etzion (M'89\u2013SM'94\u2013F'04) was born in Tel Aviv, Israel, in 1956.

This is also generalized for multidimensional synchronization patterns. The best known patterns, in terms of dots, for circles and other polygons are also given. The technique and its application for two-dimensional synchronization patterns, raises some interesting problems in discrete geometry. We will also discuss these problems. It is also shown how folding can be used to construct multidimensional error-correcting codes.

The designed codes achieve higher code rates than single error correcting codes previously given in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2146330","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2146330","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895071.pdf","startPage":"4477","endPage":"4487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic, Single Limited Magnitude Error Correcting Codes for Flash Memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Systematic, Single Limited Magnitude Error Correcting Codes for Flash Memories","volume":"57","issue":"7","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5895071/","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12063254","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895071/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Systematic, Single Limited Magnitude Error Correcting Codes for Flash Memories","sourcePdf":"tit-klove-2146330-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168527S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5895044","articleId":"5895071","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5895072,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Konig","affiliation":["Institute for Quantum Information, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Konig","id":"37283049100"},{"name":"Renato Renner","affiliation":["Institute for Theoretical Physics, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Renner","id":"37283021500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5895072","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":633},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random variables","Data mining","Computational modeling","Entropy","Cryptography","Context","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptographic protocols","minimum entropy methods","probability","quantum cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum knowledge","random variables","probability","minimum entropy","quantum system","bounded-storage model","sample-hash protocol","quantum cryptography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bounded-storage model","min-entropy","privacy amplification","quantum cryptography","quantum extractors","randomness extraction","sampling"]}],"abstract":"Let \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">X</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n,..., \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Xn</i>\n be a sequence of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n classical random variables and consider a sample \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Xs</i>\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n,..., \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">Xsr</i>\n of \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">r</i>\n \u2264 \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n positions selected at random.

We consider a diversity scheme where only the sensor with the best channel sends their measurements over a fading channel to a fusion center, using the analog amplify and forwarding technique. The fusion centre reconstructs a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimate of the source based on the received measurements. A distributed version of the diversity scheme where sensors decide whether to transmit based only on their local channel information is also considered. We derive asymptotic expressions for the expected distortion (of the MMSE estimate at the fusion centre) of these schemes as the number of sensors becomes large. For comparison, asymptotic expressions for the expected distortion for a coherent multiaccess scheme and an orthogonal access scheme are derived. It is seen that as opposed to the coherent multiaccess scheme and the orthogonal scheme (where the expected distortion decays as 1/M, M being the number of sensors), the expected distortion decays only as 1/ln(M) for the diversity schemes. This reduction of the decay rate can be seen as a tradeoff between the simplicity of the diversity schemes and the strict synchronization and large bandwidth requirements for the coherent multiaccess and the orthogonal schemes, respectively. We study for the diversity schemes, the optimal power allocation for minimizing the expected distortion subject to average power constraints. The effect of optimizing the probability of transmission on the expected distortion in the distributed scenario is also studied. It is proved that for Rayleigh fading optimal sensor transmit power allocation achieves the same asymptotic scaling law as the constant power allocation scheme, whereas it is observed that optimizing the sensor transmission probability (with or without optimal power allocation) in the distributed case makes very little difference to the asymptotic scaling laws.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2146070","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895074.pdf","startPage":"4740","endPage":"4759","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2146070","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Scaling Laws of Diversity Schemes in Decentralized Estimation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5895074","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895074/","displayDocTitle":"On Scaling Laws of Diversity Schemes in Decentralized Estimation","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12063257","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5895074/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Scaling Laws of Diversity Schemes in Decentralized Estimation","sourcePdf":"tit-leong-2146070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121786S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5895044","articleId":"5895074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5895077,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9dric Artigue","affiliation":["Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., Toulouse, France"],"bio":{"p":["C\u00e9dric Artigue was born in Villeneuve-sur-Lot, France, in 1982.

When the underlying process is not band-limited, sampling at any uniform rate leads to aliasing, while certain stochastic sampling schemes, including Poisson process sampling, are rendered infeasible by the constraint of minimum separation. It is shown in this paper that, subject to this constraint, no point process sampling scheme is alias-free for the class of all spectra. It turns out that point process sampling under this constraint can be alias-free for band-limited spectra. However, the usual construction of a consistent spectrum estimator does not work in such a case. Simulations indicate that a commonly used estimator, which is consistent in the absence of this constraint, performs poorly when the constraint is present. These results should help practitioners in rationalizing their expectations from point process sampling as far as spectrum estimation is concerned, and motivate researchers to look for appropriate estimators of bandlimited spectra.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2146510","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895093.pdf","startPage":"4709","endPage":"4719","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2146510","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effect of Inter-Sample Spacing Constraint on Spectrum Estimation with Irregular Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Effect of Inter-Sample Spacing Constraint on Spectrum Estimation with Irregular Sampling","volume":"57","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5895093/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12063275","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895093/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effect of Inter-Sample Spacing Constraint on Spectrum Estimation with Irregular Sampling","sourcePdf":"tit-srivastava-2146510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057725S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","xplore-issue":"5895044","articleId":"5895093","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5895094,"authors":[{"name":"Giorgio Taricco","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica, Politecnico di Turino, Torino, Italy"],"bio":{"p":["Giorgio Taricco (M'91\u2013SM'03\u2013F'10) was born in Torino, Italy.

The method is applicable to MIMO channels affected by separately correlated Rician fading and co-channel interference. It is assumed that the number of transmit, receive and interfering antennas grows asymptotically while their ratios, as well as the SNR and the SIR, approach finite constants. Nevertheless, it is shown that the asymptotic results represent an accurate approximation in the case of a finitely many antennas and can be used to derive the ergodic channel capacity. This is accomplished by using an iterative power allocation algorithm based on a water-filling approach. The convergence of a similar algorithm (nicknamed frozen water-filling) was conjectured in a work by Dumont et al. Here, we show that, in the Rayleigh case, the frozen water-filling algorithm may not converge while, in those cases, our proposed algorithm converges.

This channel model has been extensively studied in the past years and capacity results have been proved for certain classes of channels. This paper presents new inner and outer bounds for the capacity region of the cognitive interference channel, as well as new capacity results. Previously proposed outer bounds are expressed in terms of auxiliary random variables for which no cardinality constraint of their alphabet is known. Consequently, it is not possible to evaluate such outer bounds explicitly for a given channel. The outer bound derived in this work is based on an idea originally devised by Sato for channels without receiver cooperation and results in an outer bound that does not contain auxiliary random variables, thus allowing it to be more easily evaluated. The inner bound presented in this work-which includes rate splitting, superposition coding, a broadcast channel-like binning scheme and Gel'fand Pinsker coding-is the largest known to date and is explicitly shown to include all previously proposed achievable rate regions. The novel inner and outer bounds are shown to coincide in certain cases. In particular, capacity is proved for a class of channels in the so-called \u201cbetter cognitive decoding\u201d regime, which includes the regimes in which capacity was known. Finally, the capacity region of the semi-deterministic cognitive interference channel, in which the signal at the cognitive receiver is an arbitrary deterministic function of the channel inputs, is established.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2146310","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2146310","startPage":"4087","endPage":"4109","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895095.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New Inner and Outer Bounds for the Memoryless Cognitive Interference Channel and Some New Capacity Results","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"New Inner and Outer Bounds for the Memoryless Cognitive Interference Channel and Some New Capacity Results","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","volume":"57","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5895095/","accessionNumber":"12063277","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895095/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New Inner and Outer Bounds for the Memoryless Cognitive Interference Channel and Some New Capacity Results","sourcePdf":"tit-tuninetti-2146310-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.264272S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5895044","articleId":"5895095","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5895096,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Tandon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA","Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Tandon","id":"38556954900"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5895096","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":26,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":374},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise measurement","Transmitters","Random variables","Noise","Channel models","Integrated circuits","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","channel capacity","interference (signal)","multi-access systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dependence balance based outer bounds","Gaussian networks","two-user multiple access channel","generalized feedback","two-user interference channel","Gaussian MAC with noisy feedback","transmitter","additive white Gaussian noise","cut-set outer bound","feedback noise variances","Gaussian MAC with user-cooperation","Gaussian IC with user-cooperation","cooperation noise variances"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dependence balance","generalized feedback","user cooperation","noisy feedback"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dependence Balance Based Outer Bounds for Gaussian Networks With Cooperation and Feedback","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2145150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","endPage":"4086","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895096.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2145150","startPage":"4063","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5895096","abstract":"We obtain new outer bounds on the capacity regions of the two-user multiple access channel with generalized feedback (MAC-GF) and the two-user interference channel with generalized feedback (IC-GF).

We first consider a Gaussian MAC with noisy feedback (MAC-NF), where transmitter k, k = 1, 2, receives a feedback Y(F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sub>\n), which is the channel output Y corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise Z\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sub>\n. For this channel model, the cut-set outer bound is not sensitive to the feedback noise variances. We demonstrate that our outer bound improves upon the cut-set bound for all nonzero values of the feedback noise variances. Moreover, in the limit as \u03c3(Z\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">k</sub>\n)\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n \u2192 \u221e, k = 1, 2, our outer bound collapses to the capacity region of the Gaussian MAC without feedback. Secondly, we investigate a Gaussian MAC with user-cooperation (MAC-UC), where each transmitter receives an additive white Gaussian noise corrupted version of the channel input of the other transmitter. For this channel model, the cut-set bound is sensitive to the cooperation noises, but not sensitive enough. For all nonzero values of cooperation noise variances, our outer bound strictly improves upon the cut-set outer bound. Moreover, as the cooperation noises become large, our outer bound collapses to the capacity region of the Gaussian MAC without cooperation. Thirdly, we investigate a Gaussian IC with user-cooperation (IC UC). For this channel model, the cut-set bound is again sensitive to cooperation noise variances as in the case of MAC-UC channel model, but not sensitive enough. We demonstrate that our outer bound strictly improves upon the cut-set bound for all nonzero values of cooperation noise variances.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895096/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"57","issue":"7","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12063278","displayDocTitle":"Dependence Balance Based Outer Bounds for Gaussian Networks With Cooperation and Feedback","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dependence Balance Based Outer Bounds for Gaussian Networks With Cooperation and Feedback","sourcePdf":"tit-ulukus-2145150-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036482S","chronDate":"July  2011","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"26","articleId":"5895096","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5895097,"authors":[{"name":"Lav R.

This paper studies limits in processing noisy signals with noisy circuits by investigating the effect of noise on standard iterative decoders for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Concentration of decoding performance around its average is shown to hold when noise is introduced into message-passing and local computation. Density evolution equations for simple faulty iterative decoders are derived. In one model, computing nonlinear estimation thresholds shows that performance degrades smoothly as decoder noise increases, but arbitrarily small probability of error is not achievable. Probability of error may be driven to zero in another system model; the decoding threshold again decreases smoothly with decoder noise. As an application of the methods developed, an achievability result for reliable memory systems constructed from unreliable components is provided.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2145870","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895097.pdf","startPage":"4427","endPage":"4444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2145870","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of LDPC Codes Under Faulty Iterative Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5895097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"Performance of LDPC Codes Under Faulty Iterative Decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895097/","publicationDate":"July 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12068808","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5895097/","volume":"57","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of LDPC Codes Under Faulty Iterative Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-varshney-2145870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.232366S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"87","xplore-issue":"5895044","articleId":"5895097","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5895098,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Vaze","affiliation":["School of Technology and Computer Science, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India"],"bio":{"p":["Rahul Vaze received the B.E. degree in electronics engineering from the Madhav Institute of Technology and Science, Gwalior, India, in 2002, the M.E. degree in Telecommunications from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Texas at Austin in 2009.","From 2004\u20132006, he was a Design Engineer with Beceem Communications Pvt.

This paper considers a multiple input multiple output (MIMO) two-way relay channel, where each relay node has one or more antennas. Optimal relay transmission strategies for the two-way relay channel are derived to maximize the achievable rate with amplify and forward (AF) at each relay and to achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DM-tradeoff). To maximize the achievable rate with AF, an iterative algorithm is proposed which solves a power minimization problem subject to minimum signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio constraints at every step. The power minimization problem is nonconvex. The Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions, however, are shown to be sufficient for optimality. Capacity scaling law of the two-way relay channel with increasing number of relays is also established by deriving a lower and upper bound on the capacity region of the two-way relay channel. To achieve the optimal DM-tradeoff, a compress and forward strategy is proposed and its DM-tradeoff is derived. For the full-duplex two-way relay channel, the proposed strategy achieves the optimal DM-tradeoff, while for the half-duplex case the proposed strategy is shown to achieve the optimal DM-tradeoff under some conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895098/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","volume":"57","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"12063279","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5895098/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the Capacity and Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of the Two-Way Relay Channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Capacity and Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff of the Two-Way Relay Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-vaze-2146710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.210478S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"98","xplore-issue":"5895044","articleId":"5895098","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5895099,"authors":[{"name":"Wojciech Szpankowski","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Wojciech Szpankowski (F'04) received the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Gdansk University of Technology.","He is the Saul Rosen Professor of Computer Science and (by courtesy) Electrical and Computer Engineering at Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, where he teaches and conducts research in analysis of algorithms, information theory, bioinformatics, analytic combinatorics, random structures, and stability problems of distributed systems.

We propose a non diagonal precoder based on the X-Codes in to increase the mutual information. The MIMO channel is transformed into a set of parallel subchannels using singular value decomposition (SVD) and X-Codes are then used to pair the subchannels. X-Codes are fully characterized by the pairings and a 2 \u00d7 2 real rotation matrix for each pair (parameterized with a single angle). This precoding structure enables us to express the total mutual information as a sum of the mutual information of all the pairs. The problem of finding the optimal precoder with the above structure, which maximizes the total mutual information, is solved by: i) optimizing the rotation angle and the power allocation within each pair and ii) finding the optimal pairing and power allocation among the pairs. It is shown that the mutual information achieved with the proposed pairing scheme is very close to that achieved with the optimal pre coder by Cruz et al., and is significantly better than Mercury/waterfllling strategy by Lozano et al. Our approach greatly simplifies both the precoder optimization and the detection complexity, making it suitable for practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2146050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895100.pdf","startPage":"4156","endPage":"4169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2146050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precoding by Pairing Subchannels to Increase MIMO Capacity With Discrete Input Alphabets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5895100","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895100/","displayDocTitle":"Precoding by Pairing Subchannels to Increase MIMO Capacity With Discrete Input Alphabets","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12063281","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5895100/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precoding by Pairing Subchannels to Increase MIMO Capacity With Discrete Input Alphabets","sourcePdf":"tit-viterbo-2146050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127266S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5895044","articleId":"5895100","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5895103,"authors":[{"name":"Zilong Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zilong","lastName":"Wang","id":"38024816900"},{"name":"Guang Gong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Guang","lastName":"Gong","id":"37272938000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5895103","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":552},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Oscillators","Generators","Finite element methods","OFDM","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["correlation methods","Fourier transforms","harmonic oscillators","sequences","signal representation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Weil representation","low two-dimensional correlation","signal set representation","additive character","multiplicative character","finite field","time-shift distinct sequences","two-dimensional autocorrelation function","upper bound","Fourier transform spectrum","phase-shift distinct sequences","ambiguity function","finite harmonic oscillator system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ambiguity function","autocorrelation","cross correlation","Fourier transform","sequence","Weil representation"]}],"abstract":"A new elementary expression of the construction first proposed by Gurevich, Hadani, and Sochen is given, which avoids the explicit use of the Weil representation.

We first study a maximum eigenmode beamforming (MEB) strategy for fading multiple access channels (MACs). This strategy allows each user to transmit only in its maximum eigenmode direction and applies a suboptimal matched-filter receiver with successive interference cancellation at the base station (BS). We derive a closed-form expression for the average minimum transmitted sum power required by MEB. Based on this, we show that: a) the MEB strategy is asymptotically optimal when the number of simultaneous users is sufficiently large; b) multi-user concurrent transmission has a power advantage, referred to as multi-user gain, over orthogonal transmission approaches such as time-division multiple-access; c) the number of antennas at the BS has a far stronger impact on the system performance than that at each user side. These properties are verified by simulation. Both numerical analyses and simulation results show that a major part of multi-user gain can be achieved in practical environments even with a quite small number of simultaneous users. We also study the MEB strategy for MIMO broadcast channels (BCs). The dirty paper coding (DPC) technique is necessary in this case. It is analytically shown that most observations made for MIMO MACs are extendable to MIMO BCs.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2145810","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895105.pdf","startPage":"4170","endPage":"4186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2145810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Maximum Eigenmode Beamforming and Multi-User Gain","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5895105","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895105/","displayDocTitle":"On Maximum Eigenmode Beamforming and Multi-User Gain","volume":"57","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12063286","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Maximum Eigenmode Beamforming and Multi-User Gain","sourcePdf":"tit-wang-2145810-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057121S","chronDate":"July  2011","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","articleId":"5895105","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5895106,"authors":[{"name":"T.

We are interested in two closely related themes: \u00b7 feature selection, or identifying the basis functions with nonzero coefficients; \u00b7 estimation accuracy, or reconstructing the target function from noisy observations. Two heuristics that are widely used in practice are forward and backward greedy algorithms. First, we show that neither idea is adequate.

For least squares regression, we develop strong theoretical results for the new procedure showing that it can effectively solve this problem under some assumptions.

We introduce the concept of connectivity region defined as the set of density pairs-the density of secondary users and the density of primary transmitters - under which the secondary network is connected. Using theories and techniques from continuum percolation, we analytically characterize the connectivity region of the secondary network and reveal the tradeoff between proximity (the number of neighbors) and the occurrence of spectrum opportunities. Specifically, we establish three basic properties of the connectivity region-contiguity, monotonicity of the boundary and uniqueness of the infinite connected component, where the uniqueness implies the occurrence of a phase transition phenomenon in terms of the almost sure existence of either zero or one infinite connected component; we identify and analyze two critical densities which jointly specify the profile as well as an outer bound on the connectivity region; we study the impacts of secondary users' transmission power on the connectivity region and the conditional average degree of a secondary user and demonstrate that matching the interference ranges of the primary and the secondary networks maximizes the tolerance of the secondary network to the primary traffic load. Furthermore, we establish a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for connectivity, which lead to an outer bound and an inner bound on the connectivity region.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5895044","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5895044/05895112.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2011.2145650","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2011.2145650","startPage":"4315","endPage":"4332","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Connectivity of Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5895112/","displayDocTitle":"Connectivity of Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5895112/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"57","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"12063291","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Connectivity of Heterogeneous Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-zhao-2145650-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092596S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5895044","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5895044","articleId":"5895112","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5897973,"authors":[{"name":"Emna Eitel","firstName":"Emna","lastName":"Eitel"},{"name":"Joachim Speidel","firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Speidel"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3343-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5897973","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Kalman filters","Bit error rate","Receivers","MIMO"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, a Kalman algorithm is applied to track a time-varying flat fading MIMO channel.

In the proposed MF-SIC with shadow area constraints (SAC) algorithm, an enhanced multiple user interference (MUI) cancellation is achieved by introducing the feedback diversity (FD) to combat the error propagation in decision feedback loops. We also combine the MF-SIC with multi-branch (MB) processing, which achieves a higher detection diversity. For coded systems, a low-complexity soft-input soft-output (SISO) iterative (turbo) detector is proposed based on the MF interference suppression and the soft canceler followed by a MMSE scheme (SC/MMSE). The computational complexity of the proposed MF-SIC is as low as the conventional SIC algorithm with very low additional complexity added. The simulation results show that the algorithm significantly outperforms the conventional SIC schemes and approaches the single user bound performance in coded systems.","displayPublicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5897968/5897969/05897989.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5897989","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative Successive Interference Cancellation Based on Multiple Feedback For Multiuser MIMO Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Complexity theory","Detectors","Decoding","Silicon carbide","Signal to noise ratio","Integrated circuits","Bit error rate"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5897989/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Iterative Successive Interference Cancellation Based on Multiple Feedback For Multiuser MIMO Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative Successive Interference Cancellation Based on Multiple Feedback For Multiuser MIMO Systems","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"563343021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027831S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","isNumber":"5897969","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5897968","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5897989","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5897996,"authors":[{"name":"Michal Simko","firstName":"Michal","lastName":"Simko"},{"name":"Di Wu","firstName":"Di","lastName":"Wu"},{"name":"Christian Mehlfuehrer","firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Mehlfuehrer"},{"name":"Johan Eilert","firstName":"Johan","lastName":"Eilert"},{"name":"Dake Liu","firstName":"Dake","lastName":"Liu"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3343-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5897996","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":998},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5897996","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Correlation","MIMO","Hardware","Complexity theory"]}],"publicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5897968/5897969/05897996.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation Aspects of Channel Estimation for 3GPP LTE Terminals","abstract":"In this paper, hardware implementation aspects of the channel estimator in 3GPP LTE terminals are investigated.

Implemented using a 65nm CMOS process, the channel estimator supports the full 20MHz bandwidth of 3GPP LTE and consumes only 49 kgates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5897996/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Implementation Aspects of Channel Estimation for 3GPP LTE Terminals","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation Aspects of Channel Estimation for 3GPP LTE Terminals","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"563343028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024213S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","isNumber":"5897969","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5897968","citationCount":"8","articleId":"5897996","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5898001,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Zhou","firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Zhou"},{"name":"Norbert Goertz","firstName":"Norbert","lastName":"Goertz"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3343-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898001","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":118},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Unavoidable Cycles in Polynomial-Based Time-Invariant LDPC Convolutional Codes","displayPublicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5897968/5897969/05898001.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897969","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Parity check codes","Convolutional codes","Delay","Block codes","Decoding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898001","abstract":"Low-Density Parity-Check convolutional codes (LDPCccs) are very interesting for practical error-correction coding in wireless transmission as they have excellent performance and at the same time they allow for variable block size with low complexity encoding and decoding.

By using BD the MU-MIMO broadcast channel can be decomposed into multiple parallel independent SU-MIMO channels through two singular value decomposition (SVD) operations. Complex lattice reduction (CLR) is another technique that aims to enforce orthogonality between the columns of the channel matrix and reduce its size as well. In this paper, only the first SVD is adopted to obtain parallel SU-MIMO channels with zero interference, the orthogonalization and size-reduction work are left for the CLR algorithm so that a modification of the channel matrix is carried out, resulting in a better precoding and detection performances. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm greatly outperforms conventional BD detection and linear precoding techniques.","publicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5897968/5897969/05898003.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lattice Reduction-Aided Preprocessing and Detection Techniques for MU-MIMO in Broadcast Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898003/","displayDocTitle":"Lattice Reduction-Aided Preprocessing and Detection Techniques for MU-MIMO in Broadcast Channel","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lattice Reduction-Aided Preprocessing and Detection Techniques for MU-MIMO in Broadcast Channel","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"563343035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.014794S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","isNumber":"5897969","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5897968","citationCount":"1","articleId":"5898003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898022,"authors":[{"name":"Rizwan Ghaffar","firstName":"Rizwan","lastName":"Ghaffar"},{"name":"Umer Salim","firstName":"Umer","lastName":"Salim"},{"name":"Irfan Ghauri","firstName":"Irfan","lastName":"Ghauri"},{"name":"Raymond Knopp","firstName":"Raymond","lastName":"Knopp"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3343-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898022","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"abstract":"The broadcast channels (BC), a single transmitter transmitting data to multiple receivers, have been widely studied in literature mostly with and sometimes without the availability of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). We study a very practical version of the BC where the transmitter has CSIT of some users and no CSIT for other users. We look at the simplest instance of such a heterogeneous BC where a multi-antenna transmitter base-station (BS) is trying to communicate data to two single-antenna user equipments (UEs), having the perfect CSIT about UE-1 and no CSIT about UE-2. We propose a very simple transmission strategy at the BS combined with an intelligent interference-aware receiver at UE-2. We show that under the proposed transmission strategy, the sum rate can be significantly improved (unbounded in SNR) if low complexity interference-aware receiver is employed at UE-2 as compared to the case when UEs resort to suboptimal single-user detection where rates are bounded (in SNR). We then extend the proposed transmission strategy to long term evolution (LTE) scenario and show that the employment of interference aware receivers significantly improve performance in spite of the low resolution LTE precoders. It therefore underlines the necessity of intelligent receivers for modern wireless systems in the pursuit of high spectral efficiency.","displayPublicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5897968/5897969/05898022.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898022","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mixed CSIT DL Channel: Gains with Interference Aware Receivers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Receivers","Signal to noise ratio","Complexity theory","Antennas","Phase shift keying"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898022/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Mixed CSIT DL Channel: Gains with Interference Aware Receivers","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mixed CSIT DL Channel: Gains with Interference Aware Receivers","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"563343054.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.030757S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","isNumber":"5897969","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5897968","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5898022","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898025,"authors":[{"name":"Omid Javidbakht","firstName":"Omid","lastName":"Javidbakht"},{"name":"Navid Naderi Alizadeh","firstName":"Navid Naderi","lastName":"Alizadeh"},{"name":"S.

Relays work on Amplify and Forward (AF) method and there is no direct link between the transmitter and the receiver. The optimization problem is to maximize the throughput of the receiver with constraints on the amounts of the power of the transmitter and relays, and subcarriers. We will introduce an algorithm to select the best relay for each subcarrier.

To address this issue, heterogeneous networks have recently being considered as a comprehensive approach to provide high cellular network capacity and coverage. However, the dense and random deployment of small cells and their uncoordinated operation raise important questions about the energy efficiency implications of multi-tier networks. In this paper, we analyze the energy efficiency of downlink two-tier heterogeneous networks, i.e. a network of macrocell base stations overlaid by randomly distributed picocell base stations, where each tier serves a disjoint set of users. Using tools from stochastic geometry, we first derive analytical expressions of success probabilities for each tier when a disjoint set of subchannels is employed. In addition, we evaluate the performance of two-tier networks in terms of energy efficiency and fairness of resource allocation. Numerical results confirm that there exists an optimal pico-macro density ratio that maximizes the overall energy efficiency of such a two-tier network. This work provides essential understanding for successful deployment of green heterogeneous networks.","publicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5897968/5897969/05898061.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897969","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Analysis of Two-Tier Heterogeneous Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898061","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Analysis of Two-Tier Heterogeneous Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898061/","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Analysis of Two-Tier Heterogeneous Networks","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"563343094.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036406S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","isNumber":"5897969","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5897968","citationCount":"14","articleId":"5898061","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5898062,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Laot","firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Laot"},{"name":"Raphael Le Bidan","firstName":"Raphael Le","lastName":"Bidan"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3343-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898062","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":175},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898062","abstract":"This paper presents some results on adaptive minimum mean-square error (MMSE) turbo equalization obtained from underwater experiments in the Atlantic ocean.

PTR exploits the physics of acoustic propagation to mitigate intersymbol interference in a simple and robust way, reducing the need for long OFDM symbols and prefixes. We adopt recent basis pursuit methods for identification of sparse responses from PTR channel probes. This effectively discards unstable or insignificant estimated channel coefficients, improving the performance relative to PTR with directly observed channel responses. We present results for data collected during the CALCOM'10 sea trial with 4.5 kHz bandwidth, 4.1-6.4 kbit/s raw data rates (2-3.2 kbit/s before convolutional coding), and 3 km communication range. Channel responses are sparse, with delay spreads of 20-30 ms that PTR reduces to 5-10 ms. Subsequent OFDM demodulation attains good results in much of the signal bandwidth, although some seemingly source-related issues remain that lead to overall higher error rates than using plain OFDM with multichannel combining.","publicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5897968/5897969/05898078.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897969","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demodulation of Underwater OFDM Transmissions by Time Reversal and Basis Pursuit Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898078","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","displayDocTitle":"Demodulation of Underwater OFDM Transmissions by Time Reversal and Basis Pursuit Methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898078/","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demodulation of Underwater OFDM Transmissions by Time Reversal and Basis Pursuit Methods","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"563343111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031543S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","isNumber":"5897969","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5897968","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5898078","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898081,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio De Domenico","firstName":"Antonio De","lastName":"Domenico"},{"name":"Emilio Calvanese Strinati","firstName":"Emilio Calvanese","lastName":"Strinati"},{"name":"Andrzej Duda","firstName":"Andrzej","lastName":"Duda"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-3-8007-3343-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898081","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":463},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Femtocells","Interference","Macrocell networks","Copper","Quality of service","OFDM","Downlink"]}],"abstract":"The femtocell deployment in 3GPP/LTE sets new challenges to energy efficiency and Radio Resource Management (RRM). Traditional schemes are mainly designed for classical cellular networks while the ad hoc nature of femtocells notably limits the complexity of possible algorithms. Thus, efficient RRM schemes are essential for limiting the interference impact on end-user performance. The goal of this paper is to achieve effective spectral reuse between neighbour cells and reduce the femtocell downlink power consumption while guaranteeing the QoS of users served by both macro and femto base stations. We discuss the effectiveness of two resource management schemes that limit the overall interference per Resource Block (RB) generated outside the coverage range of a femtocell while reducing the transmission power in each RB. Our simulation results show that the proposed RRM schemes enhance the energy efficiency of the overall cellular network while improving both macrocell and femtocell throughput.","publicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"17th European Wireless 2011 - Sustainable Wireless Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5897968/5897969/05898081.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5897969","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ghost Femtocells: an Energy-Efficient Radio Resource Management Scheme for Two-Tier Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898081","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"VDE","displayDocTitle":"Ghost Femtocells: an Energy-Efficient Radio Resource Management Scheme for Two-Tier Cellular Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 April 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898081/","conferenceDate":"27-29 April 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"29 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ghost Femtocells: an Energy-Efficient Radio Resource Management Scheme for Two-Tier Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Vienna, Austria","sourcePdf":"563343114.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.106636S","chronDate":"27-29 April 2011","isNumber":"5897969","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5897968","citationCount":"2","articleId":"5898081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"VDE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898088,"authors":[{"name":"Mountassar Maamoun","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Blida, Burgas, Algeria"],"firstName":"Mountassar","lastName":"Maamoun","id":"37273375200"},{"name":"Rafik Bradai","affiliation":["Department of Electronics, University of Blida, Burgas, Algeria"],"firstName":"Rafik","lastName":"Bradai","id":"38015108400"},{"name":"Abdelhamid Meraghni","affiliation":["LSIC Laboratory, Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, Kouba, Algiers, Algeria"],"firstName":"Abdelhamid","lastName":"Meraghni","id":"37974368700"},{"name":"Rachid Beguenane","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada, Kingston, Canada"],"firstName":"Rachid","lastName":"Beguenane","id":"37349117600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9024-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9023-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898088","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":479},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite impulse response filter","Computer architecture","Adders","Discrete wavelet transforms","Low pass filters","Convolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","field programmable gate arrays","FIR filters","image processing","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI discrete wavelet transform","FIR filters","very high-speed signal","image processing","finite impulse response filters","parallel arithmetic methods","pipeline arithmetic methods","JPEG2000 coefficients filters","Xilinx field programmable gate array devices","FPGA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)","Fast Convolution","Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filter","FPGA","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents new VLSI architectures for finite impulse response (FIR) filters and discrete wavelet transform, intended for very high-speed signal and image processing. The proposed architectures, based on combining pipeline and parallel arithmetic methods, provide a new and very fast convolution approach with a reduced critical path. The key to this is a clever use of D-latches and multipliers which are efficiently distributed. Furthermore, an advanced discrete wavelet transform (DWT) approach, with an area-efficient architecture, is designed to produce one output in every clock cycle. As a result, a very high-speed is attained. The proposed structure can increase the work frequency (85%) at a low cost of additional hardware elements (55%).

Tests are carried out with different disturbance signal types, namely random and finite duration step. The control design comprises a direct optimization of the controller parameters based on minimization of the error (observed) signal.

considered to be the third generation of neural networks, and have proved more powerful than classical artificial neural networks from the previous generations. The main reason for studying SNNs lies in their close resemblance with biological neural networks. However their applicability in real world applications has been limited due to the lack of efficient training methods. For training large networks on large data sets, online learning is the more natural approach for learning non-stationary tasks. In this paper, existing offline and online learning algorithms for SNNs will be reviewed, the issue that online learning algorithms for SNNs were less developed will be highlighted, and future lines of research related to online training of SNNs will be presented.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898113","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cyberntic Intelligent Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cyberntic Intelligent Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784247/5898083/05898113.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898083","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRICIS.2010.5898113","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/UKRICIS.2010.5898113","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898113/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Online versus offline learning for spiking neural networks: A review and new strategies","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"1-2 Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5898113/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","accessionNumber":"12071087","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Online versus offline learning for spiking neural networks: A review and new strategies","confLoc":"Reading, UK","sourcePdf":"cis09submission26.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080343S","chronDate":"1-2 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5784247","isNumber":"5898083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784247","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5898083","articleId":"5898113","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-14"},{"_id":5898115,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Some theoretical aspects of the electromagnetic field penetration into a rectangular enclosure through apertures are reviewed. It is shown that for a simple system topology analytical formulations based on a transmission line model give good predictions of the shielding effectiveness of a rectangular enclosure with apertures. Both the magnetic and electric shielding may be calculated as a function of frequency, enclosure dimensions, apertures dimensions and positions within the enclosure. This analytical approach is validated by comparing the shielding effectiveness predictions with full-field simulations using the finite-difference time-domain technique, software CST and experimental investigations of the shielding effectiveness in a semi anechoic chamber. Industrial needs in terms of EMC require that the experimental results of the shielding effectiveness are accurate for large frequency intervals. To meet this requirement, a neural network based model is used for the implementation of inverse models in order to estimate physical and geometrical parameters of enclosures. In this context an application is considered. It Concerns the evaluation of the shielding effectiveness (SE) parameter as a function of the frequency. During experimental measurements of the SE parameter we did not get enough resolution for intermediate frequencies.","doi":"10.1109/UKRICIS.2010.5898122","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784247/5898083/05898122.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cyberntic Intelligent Systems","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cyberntic Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRICIS.2010.5898122","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The analytical, numerical and neural network evaluation versus experimental of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of a rectangular enclosure with apertures","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898122/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"The analytical, numerical and neural network evaluation versus experimental of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of a rectangular enclosure with apertures","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12071096","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5898122/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The analytical, numerical and neural network evaluation versus experimental of electromagnetic shielding effectiveness of a rectangular enclosure with apertures","confLoc":"Reading, UK","sourcePdf":"cis09submission34.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056015S","chronDate":"1-2 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5784247","isNumber":"5898083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784247","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5898083","articleId":"5898122","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5898130,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A laboratory set-up that resembles the behaviour of a helicopter, namely twin rotor multi-input multi-output system (TRMS) is used as an experimental rig in this research. An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) tuned by particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed in search for non-parametric model for the TRMS. The antecedent parameters of the ANFIS are optimized by a PSO algorithm and the consequent parameters are updated using recursive least squares (RLS). The results show that the proposed technique has better convergence and better performance in modeling of a nonlinear process. The identified model is justified and validated in both time domain and frequency domain.","doi":"10.1109/UKRICIS.2010.5898130","pdfPath":"/iel5/5784247/5898083/05898130.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cyberntic Intelligent Systems","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 9th International Conference on Cyberntic Intelligent Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/UKRICIS.2010.5898130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898083","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ANFIS modelling of a twin rotor system using particle swarm optimisation and RLS","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898130/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-2 Sept. 2010","displayDocTitle":"ANFIS modelling of a twin rotor system using particle swarm optimisation and RLS","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12071104","publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5898130/","conferenceDate":"1-2 Sept. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ANFIS modelling of a twin rotor system using particle swarm optimisation and RLS","confLoc":"Reading, UK","sourcePdf":"cis09submission41.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071528S","chronDate":"1-2 Sept. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5784247","isNumber":"5898083","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5784247","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5898083","articleId":"5898130","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-02"},{"_id":5898137,"authors":[{"name":"Wieslaw Pietruszkiewicz","affiliation":["SDART Limited, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Wieslaw","lastName":"Pietruszkiewicz","id":"38015070300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9024-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-9023-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898137","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kalman filters","Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Noise","Backpropagation","Noise measurement","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","feedforward neural nets","finance","Kalman filters","nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear Kalman filtering","feedforward neural networks","artificial intelligence","unscented Kalman filter","square root central difference Kalman filter","reference algorithm","error backpropagation","neural network learning algorithm","noisy financial dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neural Networks","Unscented Kalman Filter","Square Root Central Difference Kalman Filter","Bankruptcy prediction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898137","abstract":"In this article we present an application of Kalman filtering in Artificial Intelligence, where nonlinear Kalman filters were used as a learning algorithms for feed-forward neural networks.

While the cutting edge of semiconductor technology is driven by digital logic and memory applications, several other technology sectors benefit from innovation by the leaders. Of these technology sectors, image sensor manufacturers have realized many benefits from the selective use of developments within advanced technology node manufacturing. The motivations for the imaging industry to pursue Moore's Law type of scaling are comparable to that of the broader semiconductor industry. Additionally, image sensor companies seek a reduction of camera module form factor, an increase in pixel resolution, and an increase in pixel array performance. Today, semi-professional grade digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) pixels have scaled down to the size of what were state-of-the-art \u201csmall pixel\u201d consumer grade camera phone sensors just a few years ago. The pixel size of recent camera phones has shrunk to 1.12 \u03bcm. The resolution for recent camera phones has reached 16.4 Mp. Beyond silicon foundry processes, imaging companies must also concern themselves with the optical systems and packaging solutions required to integrate their silicon devices with the consumer electronics supply chain. Chipworks, as a supplier of competitive intelligence to the semiconductor and electronics industries, monitors the evolution of image sensor technologies as they come into production. Chipworks has obtained charge-coupled devices (CCD) and CMOS image sensor (CIS) chips from leading manufacturers and performed structural, compositional, and design analyses to benchmark the technology of the market leaders.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recent innovations in CMOS image sensors","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference","doi":"10.1109/ASMC.2011.5898219","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE/SEMI Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875050/5898157/05898219.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASMC.2011.5898219","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898157","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898219","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898219/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Recent innovations in CMOS image sensors","conferenceDate":"16-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898219/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071591","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recent innovations in CMOS image sensors","confLoc":"Saratoga Springs, NY, USA","sourcePdf":"94.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040878S","chronDate":"16-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875050","isNumber":"5898157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875050","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5898157","articleId":"5898219","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5898368,"authors":[{"name":"Gongpu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5898368/5898368-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gongpu Wang received the B.

A new complex-exponential basis expansion model (CE-BEM) is proposed to represent the mobile-to-mobile time-varying channels. To estimate such channels, a novel pilot symbol-aided transmission scheme is developed such that a low complex linear approach can estimate the BEM coefficients of the convoluted channels. More essentially, two algorithms are designed to extract the BEM coefficients of the individual channels. The optimal training parameters, including the number of the pilot symbols, the placement of the pilot symbols, and the power allocation to the pilot symbols, are derived by minimizing the channel mean-square error (MSE). The selections of the system parameters are thoroughly discussed in order to guide practical system design. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to corroborate the proposed studies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898368/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","volume":"10","issue":"8","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12205935","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","publicationDate":"August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898368/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Channel Estimation and Training Design for Two-Way Relay Networks in Time-Selective Fading Environments","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Estimation and Training Design for Two-Way Relay Networks in Time-Selective Fading Environments","sourcePdf":"2681-tw1108-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.117236S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5898368","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5898370,"authors":[{"name":"Kae Won Choi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Seoul National University of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5898370/5898370-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kae Won Choi received the B.S. degree in civil, urban, and geosystem engineering in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering and computer science in 2003 and 2007, respectively, all from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

Secondary users (SUs) aim to exploit the short-lived spectrum holes (or opportunities) created between packet bursts in the PU network. The PU traffic pattern changes over both time and frequency according to upper layer events in the PU network, and fast variation in PU activity may cause high sensing error probability and low spectrum utilization in dynamic spectrum access. The proposed mechanism learns a PU traffic pattern in real-time and uses the acquired information to access the frequency channel in an efficient way while limiting the probability of collision with the PUs below a target limit. To design the channel learning algorithm, we model the CR system as a hidden Markov model (HMM) and present a gradient method to find the underlying PU traffic pattern. We also analyze the identifiability of the proposed HMM to provide a condition for the convergence of the proposed learning algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm greatly outperforms the traditional listen-before-talk algorithm which does not possess any learning functionality.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05898370.pdf","startPage":"2497","endPage":"2509","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.060711.100154","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.060711.100154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Opportunistic Access to Spectrum Holes Between Packet Bursts: A Learning-Based Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Hidden Markov models","Channel estimation","Markov processes","Signal to noise ratio","Algorithm design and analysis","Data communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","error statistics","gradient methods","hidden Markov models","probability","radio spectrum management","telecommunication traffic","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["opportunistic access","spectrum holes","packet bursts","learning-based approach","cognitive radio","data-centric primary user network","secondary users","primary user traffic pattern","error probability","spectrum utilization","dynamic spectrum access","frequency channel","collision probability","channel learning algorithm","hidden Markov model","gradient method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","opportunistic spectrum access","energy detection","hidden Markov model (HMM)","partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Opportunistic Access to Spectrum Holes Between Packet Bursts: A Learning-Based Approach","volume":"10","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/5898370/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205937","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Opportunistic Access to Spectrum Holes Between Packet Bursts: A Learning-Based Approach","sourcePdf":"2497-tw1108-choi.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079126S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5898370","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5898371,"authors":[{"name":"Chadi Abou-Rjeily","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Lebanese American University, Byblos, Lebanon"],"firstName":"Chadi","lastName":"Abou-Rjeily","id":"37541911000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1276"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2248"}],"articleNumber":"5898371","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":387},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"},{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html#pub"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898371","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Modulation","Wireless communication","Complexity theory","Encoding","Measurement","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse position modulation","ultra wideband communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shape-preserving ST code","UWB communication","multipulse PPM","multipulse pulse position modulation","power-efficient modulation scheme","impulse-radio ultra-wideband communication","constellation expansion","modulated UWB pulse"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultra-Wideband (UWB)","Space-Time (ST) codes","Multipulse Pulse Position Modulation (MPPM)"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the application of Multipulse Pulse Position Modulation (MPPM) as a power-efficient modulation scheme for Impulse-Radio Ultra-Wideband (IR-UWB) communications and we propose the first known MPPM-specific 2\u00d72 space-time code that is convenient for this modulation.

Channel state information (CSI) is essential for precoding at the base stations. An effective technique for obtaining this CSI is time-division duplex (TDD) operation where uplink training in conjunction with reciprocity simultaneously provides the base stations with downlink as well as uplink channel estimates. This paper mathematically characterizes the impact that uplink training has on the performance of such multi-cell multiple antenna systems. When non-orthogonal training sequences are used for uplink training, the paper shows that the precoding matrix used by the base station in one cell becomes corrupted by the channel between that base station and the users in other cells in an undesirable manner. This paper analyzes this fundamental problem of pilot contamination in multi-cell systems. Furthermore, it develops a new multi-cell MMSE-based precoding method that mitigates this problem. In addition to being linear, this precoding method has a simple closed-form expression that results from an intuitive optimization. Numerical results show significant performance gains compared to certain popular single-cell precoding methods.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.060711.101155","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05898372.pdf","startPage":"2640","endPage":"2651","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.060711.101155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pilot Contamination and Precoding in Multi-Cell TDD Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898372","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","displayDocTitle":"Pilot Contamination and Precoding in Multi-Cell TDD Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898372/","publicationDate":"August 2011","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"12205939","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898372/","volume":"10","issue":"8","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pilot Contamination and Precoding in Multi-Cell TDD Systems","sourcePdf":"2640-tw1108-jose.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090084S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"908","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5898372","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5898373,"authors":[{"name":"Teck Aguilar","affiliation":["Department of Wireless Networks and Multimedia Services, TELECOM & Management SudParis, Evry, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5898373/5898373-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Teck Aguilar was born in Chiapas, Mexico in 1974.

However, to achieve efficient communications while gaining full benefits from cooperation, more interactions at higher protocol layers, particularly the MAC (Medium Access Control) and network layers, are vitally required. This is ignored in most existing articles that mainly focus on physical (PHY)-layer relaying techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel cross-layer framework involving two levels of joint design-a MAC-network cross-layer design for forwarder selection (or termed routing) and a MAC-PHY for relay selection-over symbol-wise varying channels. Based on location knowledge and contention processes, the proposed cross-layer protocol, CoopGeo, aims at providing an efficient, distributed approach to select next hops and optimal relays to form a communication path. Simulation results demonstrate that CoopGeo not only operates properly with varying densities of nodes, but performs significantly better than the existing protocol BOSS in terms of the packet error rate, transmission error probability, and saturated throughput.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.060711.100480","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.060711.100480","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5985568","startPage":"2554","endPage":"2565","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5985568/05898373.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898373","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Routing","Ad hoc networks","Media Access Protocol","Wireless communication","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","ad hoc networks","cooperative communication","diversity reception","error statistics","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CoopGeo","beaconless geographic cross-layer protocol","cooperative wireless ad hoc networks","cooperative relaying","transmission technique","spatial diversity","spatially distributed nodes","higher protocol layers","medium access control","network layers","physical-layer relaying techniques","PHY-layer relaying techniques","cross-layer framework","MAC-network cross-layer design","forwarder selection","termed routing","MAC-PHY","relay selection","symbol-wise varying channels","location knowledge","contention processes","optimal relays","communication path","protocol BOSS","packet error rate","transmission error probability","saturated throughput"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ad hoc networks","cooperative networks","cross-layer design","geographic routing","relay selection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"CoopGeo: A Beaconless Geographic Cross-Layer Protocol for Cooperative Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"10","issue":"8","publicationDate":"August 2011","accessionNumber":"12205940","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898373/","isStaticHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898373/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CoopGeo: A Beaconless Geographic Cross-Layer Protocol for Cooperative Wireless Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"2554-tw1108-aguilar.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090258S","chronDate":"August  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5985568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5985568","articleId":"5898373","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5898374,"authors":[{"name":"Shao-Yu Lien","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5955046/5898374/5898374-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shao-Yu Lien received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan Ocean University, Taiwan, in 2004, and the M.S. degree in communications engineering from National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan, in 2006.

Existing solutions therefore assign orthogonal radio resources in frequency and spatial domains to each network, however, infeasible for dense femtocells deployments. It is also difficult to apply centralized resource managements facing challenges of scalability to the two-tier. Considering the infeasibility of imposing any modification on existing infrastructures, we leverage the cognitive radio technology to propose the cognitive radio resource management scheme for femtocells to mitigate cross-tier interference. Under such cognitive framework, a strategic game is further developed for the intra-tier interference mitigation. Through the concept of effective capacity, proposed radio resource management schemes are appropriately controlled to achieve required statistical delay guarantees while yielding an efficient radio resources utilization in femtocells. Performance evaluation results show that a considerable performance improvement can be generally achieved by our solution, as compared with that of state-of-the-art techniques, to facilitate the deployment of femtocells.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2011.060711.100737","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7693/5955046/05898374.pdf","startPage":"2196","endPage":"2206","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2011.060711.100737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5955046","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cognitive and Game-Theoretical Radio Resource Management for Autonomous Femtocells with QoS Guarantees","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898374","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898374/","displayDocTitle":"Cognitive and Game-Theoretical Radio Resource Management for Autonomous Femtocells with QoS Guarantees","volume":"10","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12157875","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898374/","dateOfInsertion":"14 July 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cognitive and Game-Theoretical Radio Resource Management for Autonomous Femtocells with QoS Guarantees","sourcePdf":"2196-tw1107-lien.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080048S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"5955046","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"5955046","articleId":"5898374","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5898376,"authors":[{"name":"Lung-Sheng Tsai","affiliation":["Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taiwan","Research Center of Information Technology Innovation, Academia Sinica, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/5985568/5898376/5898376-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lung-Sheng Tsai (S'05) received the B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan, in 2002, the M.S. degree in Communication Engineering from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, in 2004, and the Ph.D. degree in Graduate Institute of Communication Engineering from National Taiwan University, in 2010.

However, these methods experience their respective problems from the requirement of two samples, the movement of the sample, or the introduction of extra assistant transmission lines. To eliminate these problems, a simple method is proposed based on transmission/reflection method in this paper. This method can afford high accurate measurement results without singularities by only two measurements of uncalibrated scattering parameters with one sample and one line. One measurement is for the empty fixture and the other for the same fixture holding the sample at a single position. Additionally, the principle of the proposed method ensures it independent of the fixture and the sample position. Some experiments were made using the vector network analyzer 8753ES and a \u03a6 16-mm coaxial line fixture. The proposed method is validated by the measurements of the permittivity of polytetrafluoro ethylene from 2 to 6 GHz.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5986812","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEMC.2011.2156416","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel5/15/5986812/05898400.pdf","startPage":"684","endPage":"689","doi":"10.1109/TEMC.2011.2156416","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calibration-Independent and Position-Insensitive Transmission/Reflection Method for Permittivity Measurement With One Sample in Coaxial Line","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Calibration-Independent and Position-Insensitive Transmission/Reflection Method for Permittivity Measurement With One Sample in Coaxial Line","volume":"53","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5898400/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206197","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898400/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calibration-Independent and Position-Insensitive Transmission/Reflection Method for Permittivity Measurement With One Sample in Coaxial Line","sourcePdf":"temc-zhao-2156416-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.062435S","chronDate":"Aug.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"15","isNumber":"5986812","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"5986812","articleId":"5898400","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5898402,"authors":[{"name":"Vincent Choqueuse","affiliation":["EA 4325, University of Brest, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/6063570/5898402/5898402-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Vincent Choqueuse (S'08\u2013M'09) was born in Brest, France, in 1981.

To detect a failure, we propose a new method based on stator-current demodulation. By exploiting the configuration of three-phase machines, we demonstrate that the demodulation can be efficiently performed with low-complexity multidimensional transforms such as the Concordia transform (CT) or the principal component analysis (PCA). From a practical point of view, we also prove that PCA-based demodulation is more attractive than CT. After demodulation, we propose two statistical criteria aiming at measuring the failure severity from the demodulated signals.

Using a carefully constructed Lyapunov equation for digraphs, it is shown that many results of cooperative control on undirected graphs or balanced digraphs can be extended to strongly connected digraphs. Neural adaptive control technique is adopted to solve the cooperative tracking problems of networked nonlinear systems with unknown dynamics and disturbances. Results for both first-order and high-order nonlinear systems are given. Two examples, i.e., cooperative tracking control of coupled Lagrangian systems and modified FitzHugh-Nagumo models, justify the feasibility of the proposed neural adaptive control technique. For cooperative tracking control of the general linear systems, which include integrator dynamics as special cases, it is shown that the control gain design can be decoupled from the topology of the graphs, by using the LQR-based optimal control technique. Moreover, the synchronization region is unbounded, which is a desired property of the controller. The proposed optimal control method is applied to cooperative tracking control of two-mass-spring systems, which are well-known models for vibration in many mechanical systems.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2011.2160140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/6151927/05898403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2011.2160140","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6151927","startPage":"3026","endPage":"3041","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Lyapunov, Adaptive, and Optimal Design Techniques for Cooperative Systems on Directed Communication Graphs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Lyapunov, Adaptive, and Optimal Design Techniques for Cooperative Systems on Directed Communication Graphs","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2012","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898403/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"7","publicationDate":"July 2012","accessionNumber":"12537474","dateOfInsertion":"16 February 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Lyapunov, Adaptive, and Optimal Design Techniques for Cooperative Systems on Directed Communication Graphs","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2160140-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076333S","chronDate":"July  2012","isNumber":"6151927","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"383","articleId":"5898403","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5898407,"authors":[{"name":"William E.

Device recognition tasks (both identification and verification) are accomplished by passively monitoring and exploiting the intrinsic features of an IC's unintentional RF emissions without requiring any modification to the device being analyzed. Device discrimination is achieved using RF-DNA fingerprints comprised of higher order statistical features based on instantaneous amplitude, phase, and frequency responses as a device executes a sequence of operations. The recognition system is trained using multiple discriminant analysis to reduce data dimensionality while retaining class separability, and the resultant fingerprints are classified using a linear Bayesian classifier. Demonstrated identification and verification performance includes average identification accuracy of greater than 99.5% and equal error rates of less than 0.05% for 40 near-identical devices. Depending on the level of required classification accuracy, RF-DNA fingerprint-based authentication is well-suited for implementation as a countermeasure to device cloning, and is promising for use in a wide variety of related security problems.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2011.2160170","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2011.2160170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/6126189/05898407.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"24","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6126189","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrinsic Physical-Layer Authentication of Integrated Circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898407/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2012","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"Intrinsic Physical-Layer Authentication of Integrated Circuits","volume":"7","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"12 January 2012","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2012","accessionNumber":"12471609","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898407/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrinsic Physical-Layer Authentication of Integrated Circuits","sourcePdf":"tifs-baldwin-2160170-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097599S","chronDate":"Feb.  2012","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6126189","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"6126189","articleId":"5898407","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5898409,"authors":[{"name":"Mingyuan Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6106034/5898409/5898409-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Mingyuan Zhou received the B.Sc. degree in acoustics from Nanjing University, Nanjing, China, in 2005 and the M.Eng. degree in signal and information processing from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, in 2008.

The SVF approach operates by projecting the original data onto a new set of bases determined from PCA using singular value decomposition (SVD). The shape of the SVF weighting function, which relates the singular value spectrum of the input data to the filtering coefficients assigned to each basis function, is designed in accordance with a signal model and statistical assumptions regarding the underlying source signals. In this paper, we applied SVF for the specific application of clutter artifact rejection in diagnostic ultrasound imaging. SVF was compared to a conventional PCA-based filtering technique, which we refer to as the blind source separation (BSS) method, as well as a simple frequency-based finite impulse response (FIR) filter used as a baseline for comparison. The performance of each filter was quantified in simulated lesion images as well as experimental cardiac ultrasound data. SVF was demonstrated in both simulation and experimental results, over a wide range of imaging conditions, to outperform the BSS and FIR filtering methods in terms of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and motion tracking performance. In experimental mouse heart data, SVF provided excellent artifact suppression with an average CNR improvement of 1.8 dB (P <; 0.05) with over 40% reduction (P <; 0.05) in displacement tracking error. It was further demonstrated from simulation and experimental results that SVF provided superior clutter rejection, as reflected in larger CNR values, when filtering was achieved using complex pulse-echo received data and non-binary filter coefficients.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/6062574/05898419.pdf","startPage":"1951","endPage":"1964","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2011.2160075","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2011.2160075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6062574","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898419","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Singular Value Filter: A General Filter Design Strategy for PCA-Based Signal Separation in Medical Ultrasound Imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cardiology","Ultrasonic imaging","Principal component analysis","Finite impulse response filter","Biomedical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical ultrasonics","blind source separation","medical signal processing","principal component analysis","singular value decomposition","ultrasonic imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["singular value filter","filter design strategy","PCA based signal separation","medical ultrasound imaging","principal component analysis","SVF approach","singular value decomposition","blind source separation","finite impulse response filter","FIR filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artifact reduction","cardiac imaging","principal component analysis (PCA)","signal separation","singular value decomposition"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Animals","Artifacts","Computer Simulation","Filtration","Heart Ventricles","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Linear Models","Mice","Principal Component Analysis","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Ultrasonography"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898419/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","displayDocTitle":"The Singular Value Filter: A General Filter Design Strategy for PCA-Based Signal Separation in Medical Ultrasound Imaging","volume":"30","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5898419/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12328318","pubMedId":"21693416","dateOfInsertion":"01 November 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Singular Value Filter: A General Filter Design Strategy for PCA-Based Signal Separation in Medical Ultrasound Imaging","sourcePdf":"tmi-mauldin-2160075-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082631S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"6062574","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6062574","articleId":"5898419","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":5898427,"authors":[{"name":"Francois-Xavier Socheleau","affiliation":["Institut Telecom, Telecom Bretagne, UMR CNRS 3192 Laboratory-STICC, Universit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne de Bretagne, Brest, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6017237/5898427/5898427-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Francois-Xavier Socheleau (S'08) received the Eng. degree from the Ecole Sup\u00e9rieure d'Electronique de l'Ouest (ESEO), Angers, France, in 2001.","From 2001 to 2004, he was a Research Engineer at Thales Communications, France, where he worked on noncooperative communication interception.

This model relies on the assumption that a channel recorded at sea is a single observation of an underlying random process. From this single observation, the channel statistical properties are estimated to then feed a stochastic simulator that generates multiple realizations of the underlying process. Based on the analysis of data collected in the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, we fully relax the usual wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) assumption. We show thanks to the empirical mode decomposition that a trend stationary model suits the analyzed underwater acoustic communication channels very well. Scatterers with different path delays are also assumed to be potentially correlated so that the true second-order statistics of the channel are taken into account by our model. Test cases illustrate the benefits of channel stochastic replay to communication system design and validation.

These new services are all based on the real-time acquisition of traffic information directly from vehicles, which act as sensors that travel on the roads. With the idea of having new widespread and real-time infomobility services in the short-medium term, neither installations onboard nor new roadside infrastructures that have been set up can be taken into account. Hence, in this paper, we aim at verifying the feasibility of the real-time acquisition of traffic information from vehicles in dense areas through the universal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS). In particular, we first analytically evaluate the capacity and the coverage of a UMTS cell when multiple users frequently transmit their traffic measurements to a remote control center through a shared (common) channel. Then, we extend our results to a realistic urban scenario by investigating, through simulations, the feasibility of the service and its impact on the quality of service (QoS) perceived by other users

concept that refers to a general class of spectrum sensing algorithms that divide the sensing process into a number of sequential stages. The number of sensing stages and the sensing technique per stage can be used to optimize the performance with respect to secondary user (SU) throughput and the collision probability between primary user (PU) and SU. So far, the impact of multistage sensing on network throughput and collision probability for a realistic network model has been relatively unexplored. Therefore, we present the first analytical framework that enables the performance evaluation of different multichannel multistage spectrum sensing algorithms for opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) networks. The contribution of this paper lies in studying the effect of the following parameters on performance: number of sensing stages, physical layer sensing techniques and durations per each stage, single and parallel channel sensing and access, number of available channels, PU and SU traffic, buffering of incoming SU traffic, and medium access control layer sensing algorithms. The analyzed performance metrics include the average SU throughput and the average collision probability between PU and SU. Our results show that when the probability of PU misdetection is constrained, the performance of multistage sensing is, in most cases, superior to the single-stage sensing counterpart. In addition, prolonged channel observation at the first stage of sensing considerably decreases the collision probability while keeping the throughput at an acceptable level. Finally, in realistic PU traffic scenarios, using two stages of sensing provides a good balance between SU throughput and collision probability while meeting successful detection constraints subjected by OSA communication.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2160210","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","startPage":"3309","endPage":"3323","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05898430.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Throughput and Collision Analysis of Multichannel Multistage Spectrum Sensing Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898430/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Throughput and Collision Analysis of Multichannel Multistage Spectrum Sensing Algorithms","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219109","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"60","issue":"7","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Throughput and Collision Analysis of Multichannel Multistage Spectrum Sensing Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tvt-pawelczak-2160210-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036645S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5898430","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5898431,"authors":[{"name":"Jan Sykora","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, Prague, Czech Republic"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/6017249/5898431/5898431-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jan Sykora (M'03) received the M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic, in 1987 and 1993, respectively.","Since 1991, he has been with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Czech Technical University, where he is currently a Professor of radio engineering.

This strategy uses a Hierarchical eXclusive Code (HXC) that allows full decoding of the hierarchical symbols at the relay. The HXC represents two data sources only through the exclusive law and requires side information on the complementary data at the destination (which naturally holds for the 2-WRC). The HDF strategy has the advantage over classical medium-access control (MAC) stage relaying with joint decoding in that its rate region extends beyond the classical MAC region. We present a layered design of the HXC codebook, which uses an arbitrary outer state-of-the-art capacity-approaching code [e.g., low density parity check (LDPC)] and an inner layer with an exclusive symbol alphabet. We provide basic theorems, showing that this scheme forms an HXC, and we also evaluate its alphabet-constrained rate regions. The rate regions depend on the relative channel phase parameters. Some channel rotation leads to catastrophic violation of the exclusive law. However, these values appear only in a limited range of phases and have only a mild impact on the mean capacity for some component symbol constellations.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2011.2160105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/6017249/05898431.pdf","startPage":"3241","endPage":"3252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2011.2160105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Layered Design of Hierarchical Exclusive Codebook and Its Capacity Regions for HDF Strategy in Parametric Wireless 2-WRC","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898431","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 June 2011","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898431/","displayDocTitle":"Layered Design of Hierarchical Exclusive Codebook and Its Capacity Regions for HDF Strategy in Parametric Wireless 2-WRC","volume":"60","issue":"7","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12219110","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898431/","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Layered Design of Hierarchical Exclusive Codebook and Its Capacity Regions for HDF Strategy in Parametric Wireless 2-WRC","sourcePdf":"tvt-sykora-2160105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075283S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"6017249","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6017249","articleId":"5898431","onlineDate":"20 June 2011","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5898433,"authors":[{"name":"Pui-In Mak","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, University of Macau, Taipa, Macao, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5995181/5898433/5898433-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pui-In Mak (S'00-M'08) received the B.S.E.E.E. and Ph.D.E.E.E. degrees from the University of Macau (UM), Macao, China, in 2003 and 2006, respectively.","He has been with the UM State Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI as a Research Assistant (2003\u20132006), Invited Research Fellow (2006\u20132008) and Coordinator of the Wireless and Biomedical Research Lines (2008\u2013present).

Furthermore, for an interposer that does not contain any active device, already established process technology could be applied, TSV pitch could be coarser and a thicker interposer could be used. This paper presents the development of TSV interposer technology for a high-performance 28nm logic die that is mounted on a large silicon interposer with Cu through silicon via. A representative silicon interposer test chip with thousands of micro-bumps at 45um pitch has been fabricated. The silicon interposer is 100um thick, and is mounted on a 42.5mm\u00d742.5mm substrate through 180um pitch C4 bumps. TSV fabrication process steps and assembly process of the large logic die mounted on the TSV interposer with lead-free micro-bumps have been optimized as well as assembly of the component on the organic substrate. 3D thermal-mechanical modeling and simulation for the packaged device with TSV interposer have been performed. The samples have been subjected to thermal cycling, electro-migration and moisture sensitivity tests. Effect of TSV interposer on the stress of the die, low-k layers and fatigue life of micro bumps and C4 bumps have been investigated. Several DOEs have been performed to optimize design and material selection in order to maximize yield and reliability. Finally, Si interposer seemed to be a low-risk 3D path to have a reliable package with acceptable warpage/coplanarity, passing 1000TCB without any crack, delamination or void being detected in low-k, TSV, micro bumps and C4 bumps.","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871442/5898472/05898527.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced reliability study of TSV interposers and interconnects for the 28nm technology FPGA","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898527","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898527/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","displayDocTitle":"Advanced reliability study of TSV interposers and interconnects for the 28nm technology FPGA","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071180","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898527/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced reliability study of TSV interposers and interconnects for the 28nm technology FPGA","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"s07p04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047202S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871442","isNumber":"5898472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871442","citationCount":"120","xplore-issue":"5898472","articleId":"5898527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5898530,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A high aspect ratio, void-free Cu electro-plating technology was achieved through super filling. The aspect ratio of the TSV was larger than eight. For chip stacking, Cu/Sn micro bumps with diameters less than 20 \u03bcm were used. Solder shape prediction using surface evolver showed good correlation with experiment results within a 2.5% error. Thin wafer handling technology with thermal plastic material was also adopted in this paper. The outgassing issue for silicon dioxide (SiO\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n) was improved dramatically when an additional silicon nitride (Si\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">3</sub>\nN\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">4</sub>\n) film deposition was made. Using the slide-off method with thermal plastic thin wafer handling material, an eight-inch wafer with a thickness of less than 50 \u03bcm was processed. After the die-saw process, ten chips could be stacked using the die bonder. Thermal cycling reliability test was also conducted with the temperature ranging from -55 to 125\u00b0C. The reliability life for the proposed structure was 3,777 cycles from the Weibull plot. The average resistance for one interconnection was less than 50 m\u03a9. A 3D finite element model was also established in this study. The CTE mismatch between the polyimide and the silicon resulted in warpage. The simulation results showed that the maximum von Mises stress occurred at the corner of the TSV which could lead to a failure mode called \u201ccopper pumping.\u201d For the von Mises stress in the micro bump, the maximum value occurred between the inter-metallic compound and the substrate copper pad. From the cross-sectional SEM image of the failed sample after thermal cycling test, the failure mode had good correlation with the simulation results. Equivalent plastic strain was around 0.11% in this simulation. As both silicon substrate and silicon chips were used in this study, a small equivalent plastic strain is expected.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898530","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871442/5898472/05898530.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898530","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898472","startPage":"304","endPage":"311","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Process integration and reliability test for 3D chip stacking with thin wafer handling technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Process integration and reliability test for 3D chip stacking with thin wafer handling technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898530/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071183","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898530/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Process integration and reliability test for 3D chip stacking with thin wafer handling technology","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"s07p07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073217S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871442","isNumber":"5898472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871442","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5898472","articleId":"5898530","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5898557,"authors":[{"name":"Ying Li","affiliation":["ACE Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Ying","lastName":"Li","id":"37405709600"},{"name":"Vikram Jandhyala","affiliation":["ACE Laboratory, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA"],"firstName":"Vikram","lastName":"Jandhyala","id":"37277566300"},{"name":"Henning Braunisch","affiliation":["Components Research, Intel Corporation, Chandler, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Henning","lastName":"Braunisch","id":"37267880200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-498-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-497-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-496-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0569-5503"}],"articleNumber":"5898557","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898557","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Crosstalk","Response surface methodology","Layout","Simulated annealing","Scattering parameters","Table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit packaging","microprocessor chips","multiprocessor interconnection networks","Pareto optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimization","microprocessor package vertical interconnects","full-wave electromagnetic solution","return loss","nonuniform vertical vias","differential high-speed line","accelerated full-wave solver engine","hierarchical response surface","adaptive weighted sum method","Pareto front","high-speed channel frequency band","crosstalk characteristics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898557","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871442/5898472/05898557.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","startPage":"495","endPage":"500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898472","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of microprocessor package vertical interconnects","abstract":"The parameterization and optimization of multi-layered vertical interconnect structures can enable the successful electrical design of high-performance microprocessor packages as signaling rates and density are scaled aggressively. Improved bandwidth can also translate into lower cost through layer count reduction, smaller package size and use of standard materials. A framework built around rapid full-wave electromagnetic solution to enable parametrics and optimization is critical in order to achieve this objective. In this work, a full-wave solver based trade-off generation methodology is developed. This trade-off technique permits the exploration of return loss and crosstalk of realistic complex vertical interconnect structures. The parameterization routine includes arbitrarily placed non-uniform vertical vias, voids, and differential high-speed lines. Overall computation time is made tractable by the use of an accelerated full-wave solver engine. The hierarchical response surface based optimization approach [1] is built upon and expanded for simultaneous return loss and crosstalk optimization, respectively. Weighted sum and adaptive weighted sum methods are used to conduct multi-objective optimization and find the Pareto front. Optimized designs are found to have both significantly improved differential return loss and crosstalk characteristics over high-speed channel frequency bands of interest.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898557/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12071209","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898557/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-objective optimization of microprocessor package vertical interconnects","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-objective optimization of microprocessor package vertical interconnects","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"s11p06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041207S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871442","isNumber":"5898472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871442","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5898472","articleId":"5898557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5898571,"authors":[{"name":"Vijay Sukumaran","affiliation":["3D Systems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Vijay","lastName":"Sukumaran","id":"37976627900"},{"name":"Tapobrata Bandyopadhyay","affiliation":["3D Systems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Tapobrata","lastName":"Bandyopadhyay","id":"37681035800"},{"name":"Qiao Chen","affiliation":["3D Systems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Qiao","lastName":"Chen","id":"37931644200"},{"name":"Nitesh Kumbhat","affiliation":["3D Systems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Nitesh","lastName":"Kumbhat","id":"37283302900"},{"name":"Fuhan Liu","affiliation":["3D Systems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Fuhan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275917200"},{"name":"Raghu Pucha","affiliation":["3D Systems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Raghu","lastName":"Pucha","id":"37062222400"},{"name":"Yoichiro Sato","affiliation":["Asahi Glass Company Limited, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoichiro","lastName":"Sato","id":"38022927000"},{"name":"Mitsuru Watanabe","affiliation":["Asahi Glass Company Limited, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuru","lastName":"Watanabe","id":"37088682779"},{"name":"Kenji Kitaoka","affiliation":["Asahi Glass Company Limited, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Kitaoka","id":"37313477100"},{"name":"Motoshi Ono","affiliation":["Asahi Glass Company Limited, Japan"],"firstName":"Motoshi","lastName":"Ono","id":"37414516900"},{"name":"Yuya Suzuki","affiliation":["Zeon Corporation Limited, Japan"],"firstName":"Yuya","lastName":"Suzuki","id":"38022340700"},{"name":"Choukri Karoui","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., Tours, France"],"firstName":"Choukri","lastName":"Karoui","id":"38015201900"},{"name":"Christian Nopper","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Inc., Tours, France"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Nopper","id":"37696431000"},{"name":"Madhavan Swaminathan","affiliation":["3D Systems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Madhavan","lastName":"Swaminathan","id":"37275519500"},{"name":"Venky Sundaram","affiliation":["3D Systems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Venky","lastName":"Sundaram","id":"37274829300"},{"name":"Rao Tummala","affiliation":["3D Systems Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Rao","lastName":"Tummala","id":"37275355800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-498-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-497-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-496-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0569-5503"}],"articleNumber":"5898571","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1661},"abstract":"This paper demonstrates thin glass interposers with fine pitch through package vias (TPV) as a low cost and high I/O substrate for 3D integration. Interposers for packaging of ULK and 3D-ICs need to support large numbers of die to die interconnections with I/O pitch below 50 \u03bcm. Current organic substrates are limited by CTE mismatch, wiring density, and poor dimensional stability. Wafer based silicon interposers can achieve high I/Os at fine pitch, but are limited by high cost. Glass is an ideal interposer material due to its insulating property, large panel availability and CTE match to silicon. The main focus of this work is on a) electrical and mechanical design, b) TPV and fine line formation and c) integration process and electrical characterization of thin glass interposers. This work for the first time demonstrates high throughput formation of 30 \u03bcm pitch TPVs in ultrathin glass using a parallel laser process. An integration process was demonstrated for glass interposer with polymer build-up layers on both sides. The glass interposer had stable electrical properties up to 20GHz and low insertion loss of less than 0.15dB was measured for TPVs at 9GHz.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871442/5898472/05898571.pdf","startPage":"583","endPage":"588","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898571","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design, fabrication and characterization of low-cost glass interposers with fine-pitch through-package-vias","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Glass","Polymers","Stress","Substrates","Copper","Wiring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fine-pitch technology","glass","integrated circuit interconnections","three-dimensional integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-cost glass interposers","fine-pitch through-package-vias","TPV","high I/O substrate","3D integration","thin glass interposer","3D-IC","ULK packaging","current organic substrate","CTE mismatch","wiring density","wafer based silicon interposer","polymer build-up layers","parallel laser process","frequency 9 GHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Glass interposer","laser ablation","Electrical design","fine line wiring","through package via","mechanical modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898571/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","displayDocTitle":"Design, fabrication and characterization of low-cost glass interposers with fine-pitch through-package-vias","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898571/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071223","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, fabrication and characterization of low-cost glass interposers with fine-pitch through-package-vias","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"s13p06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06421S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871442","isNumber":"5898472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871442","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"5898472","articleId":"5898571","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5898630,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Usually, the thin wafer is attached to a supporting wafer with adhesive to increase its rigidity and bending stiffness. Thus, adhesive is the key enabling material for thin-wafer handling, and how to select adhesive materials for temporary bonding and de-bonding is the focus in this study. Two sizes of wafers are considered; the 200mm wafers are used to find out the important and unimportant parameters in selecting the adhesive and then apply them to the 300mm wafers. It will be shown that wafer thinning and PECVD (plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition) in vacuum chamber are the two critical steps for thin-wafer handling. The 300mm wafers are thinned down to 50\u03bcm and evaluated in different structures including: (a) blanket wafers, (b) wafers with 80\u03bcm solder bumps, and (c) wafers with 20\u03bcm micro-bumps and TSVs in 10\u03bcm diameter and 40~50\u03bcm pitch.

The interposer includes a lot of TSVs for the high speed signals. Technology requirements and manufacturing process to support multi-gigabit or tens-of-gigabit per second SerDes application will be presented. The interposer needs to be accurately modeled over the high frequency by considering all those requirements before design optimization. An interposer test vehicle was fabricated for measurement and verification. The measurement technique using vector network analyzer including de-embedding process will be introduced. At the same time, TSV high frequency modeling methodology will be disclosed. Both broadband s-parameter model and RLC lumped model based on physical structures were generated.

The depletion area in silicon substrate will be considered as well to increase the level of accuracy. The routing metal loss in under bump metallurgy (UBM) layer should be analyzed also. Finally, full channel analysis has been done. It includes optimized interposer model on top of package substrate and printed circuit board. Each proposed interposer structure enables high performance signaling and great visibility in both passive and active interposer.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898657","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871442/5898472/05898657.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898657","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898472","startPage":"1160","endPage":"1167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interposer design optimization for high frequency signal transmission in passive and active interposer using through silicon via (TSV)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898657","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interposer design optimization for high frequency signal transmission in passive and active interposer using through silicon via (TSV)","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898657/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071308","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898657/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interposer design optimization for high frequency signal transmission in passive and active interposer using through silicon via (TSV)","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"s26p01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040096S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871442","isNumber":"5898472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871442","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5898472","articleId":"5898657","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5898670,"authors":[{"name":"P Markondeya Raj","affiliation":["Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"P Markondeya","lastName":"Raj","id":"37430352900"},{"name":"Himani Sharma","affiliation":["Packaging Research Center, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, USA"],"firstName":"Himani","lastName":"Sharma","id":"37967050200"},{"name":"G.

Passivated cobalt nanoparticles were chemically synthesized and dispersed in epoxy to fabricate nanocomposite thick films. The high permeability comes from enhanced coupling between the metal nanoparticles while the insulating polymer matrix prevents eddy current loss and improves stability with frequency. Test vehicles were fabricated to demonstrate integration of these composites in organic substrates and to characterize the high-frequency properties. The frequency-dependent magnetic properties in 100-500 MHz range were extracted by impedance spectroscopy. Magnetic toroids were mechanically pressed with the metal-insulator powder. By refining the processing, permeability of 2.7 was demonstrated at VHF frequencies. The loss tangent was less than 0.04 at these frequencies. The GHz frequency-dependent material characteristics of the magneto-dielectric films were extracted from corner-probing of parallel-plate resonators and strip inductors. By engineering the composite structures at nanoscale, a combination of stable permeability of ~2 at 1-5 GHz and permittivity of 7, not previously reported, was achieved with polymer composites for antenna miniaturization. The magnetic nanomaterials with low loss, described in this paper, can benefit several other RF and power components, leading to their miniaturization and performance enhancement in emerging RF sub-systems. The metal composite structures also lead to high permittivity in the GHz frequencies which can benefit such RF components as antennas, by allowing closer impedance matching with air.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898670","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871442/5898472/05898670.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898670","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898472","startPage":"1244","endPage":"1249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel nanomagnetic materials for high-frequency RF applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898670","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Novel nanomagnetic materials for high-frequency RF applications","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898670/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12083199","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898670/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel nanomagnetic materials for high-frequency RF applications","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"s27p07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060071S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871442","isNumber":"5898472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871442","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5898472","articleId":"5898670","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5898689,"authors":[{"name":"M.

As a result, the fan-out inductors offer significantly higher quality factors and higher self-resonance frequencies (SRFs). We also investigate effects of the chip-to-package interconnection. We demonstrate the advantages of fan-out eWLB inductors on the example of a 6 GHz voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) chip manufactured in a 65 nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology and assembled in an eWLB package. We use a 1.1 nH high-Q differential coupled fan-out eWLB inductor for the LC tank to reduce the phase noise. We use a VCO fabricated with a standard on-chip inductor and assembled in the identical eWLB package as a reference. Measurement results demonstrate lower phase noise and higher output power of all VCOs with embedded eWLB inductors. The measured phase noise for the VCO with the fan-out eWLB inductor is in best case 9 dB lower than that of the reference VCO with the on-chip inductor. The results prove the integration concept and demonstrate excellent potential of inductors realized in the fan-out area of eWLB.","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898689","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871442/5898472/05898689.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898472","startPage":"1363","endPage":"1370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-Q embedded inductors in fan-out eWLB for 6 GHz CMOS VCO","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898689","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High-Q embedded inductors in fan-out eWLB for 6 GHz CMOS VCO","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898689/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071338","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898689/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-Q embedded inductors in fan-out eWLB for 6 GHz CMOS VCO","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"s30p05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082006S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871442","isNumber":"5898472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871442","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5898472","articleId":"5898689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5898715,"authors":[{"name":"Yoshihiro Mizuno","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshihiro","lastName":"Mizuno","id":"37331324000"},{"name":"Ikuo Soga","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Ikuo","lastName":"Soga","id":"37563308600"},{"name":"Shinichi Hirose","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Shinichi","lastName":"Hirose","id":"37331947100"},{"name":"Osamu Tsuboi","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Osamu","lastName":"Tsuboi","id":"37328080400"},{"name":"Taisuke Iwai","affiliation":["Fujitsu Laboratories Limited, Atsugi, Japan"],"firstName":"Taisuke","lastName":"Iwai","id":"37298258400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-498-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-497-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-496-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-5726"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0569-5503"},{"format":"Online ISSN","value":"0569-5503"}],"articleNumber":"5898715","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":243},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Microchannel","Silicon","Temperature measurement","Thermal resistance","Metals","Temperature dependence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aluminium compounds","cooling","fine-pitch technology","gallium compounds","III-V semiconductors","inductance","mobile communication","power amplifiers","power HEMT","silicon","thermal management (packaging)","thermal resistance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Si microchannel cooler","high power amplifier","base station","mobile communication system","bump structure","thermal management device","HPA chip","fine pitch Si bump","metal coating","HEMT HPA","source electrode","ground inductance","heat transfer path","total thermal resistance","AlGaN-GaN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898715","abstract":"This study demonstrated the first application of a Si microchannel cooler integrated with bump structures to apply as a new thermal management device for the high power amplifiers (HPAs).

Yet, heat dissipation in 3D ICs becomes more and more challenging, especially in applications that require stacking of multiple processor and memory chips. Microfluidic cooling has been proposed as a solution to reject heat from 3D stacks that contain processor chips. However, current liquid cooling technology inevitably increases the wafer thickness, which is contrary to TSV technology trend. To date, little work has been done to optimize heat sink design to benefit TSV performance, and no attempt has been made to analyze the corresponding impact of a particular heat sink design on the performance of the electrical TSVs. A heat sink design without consideration of TSV performance can greatly diminish the advantages of 3D ICs. This paper presents a holistic cooling solution for 3D ICs, which not only meets thermal requirements, but also minimizes TSV parasitics that impact latency, bandwidth density, and power consumption. This paper will report: a) the design of a 3D-centric heat sink, b) the fabrication of the heat sink and associated high aspect ratio integrated TSVs, c) the thermal testing of the liquid-cooled heat sink and comparison to air-cooled heat sink, and d) the impact of the heat sink geometry on TSV capacitance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898797/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12071442","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Coupled electrical and thermal 3D IC centric microfluidic heat sink design and technology","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Coupled electrical and thermal 3D IC centric microfluidic heat sink design and technology","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"s40p08.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086218S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871442","isNumber":"5898472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871442","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5898472","articleId":"5898797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5898809,"authors":[{"name":"Kyoung Youl Park","affiliation":["Terahertz Systems Laboratory (TeSLa), Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Kyoung Youl","lastName":"Park","id":"38026401200"},{"name":"Jose A.

Numerical simulations were performed using both the finite element (FEM) and finite-difference time domain (FDTD) numerical methods. Design, fabrication and tests were carried out for absorbers having center frequencies of 0.2 THz and 0.4 THz. Ultra-wide bandwidth and strong absorption were obtained by taking advantage of skin-effect losses in metamaterial structures, and through multi-stacking of these structures. Absorbers having high absorption coefficients and bandwidth (>; 1THz) can easily be fabricated using the approach demonstrated in this paper. Two measurement approaches are applied to characterize these structures, details of which are presented in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871442/5898472/05898809.pdf","startPage":"2107","endPage":"2113","publicationTitle":"2011 IEEE 61st Electronic Components and Technology Conference (ECTC)","doi":"10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898809","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ECTC.2011.5898809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898472","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898809","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Metamaterial-inspired absorbers for Terahertz packaging applications","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Metals","Electromagnetic waveguides","Absorption","Reflection","Time domain analysis","Metamaterials","Dielectrics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electronics packaging","metamaterials","terahertz wave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["metamaterial-inspired absorbers","terahertz packaging applications","thin metamaterial-inspired structures","wide-band absorption","stray signals","THz packages","thin metallic layer","metal backing","finite element method","finite-difference time domain method","skin-effect losses","metamaterial structures"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898809/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","displayDocTitle":"Metamaterial-inspired absorbers for Terahertz packaging applications","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898809/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071453","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"31 May-3 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Metamaterial-inspired absorbers for Terahertz packaging applications","confLoc":"Lake Buena Vista, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"s41p03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043065S","chronDate":"May 31 2011-June 3 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871442","isNumber":"5898472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871442","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5898472","articleId":"5898809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5898852,"authors":[{"name":"Krishnan Chammangat","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - IBBT, Gaston Crommenlaan 8, Bus 201, B-9050, Belgium"],"firstName":"Krishnan","lastName":"Chammangat","id":"37088195979"},{"name":"Francesco Ferranti","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - IBBT, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Francesco","lastName":"Ferranti","id":"37408234200"},{"name":"Luc Knockaert","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - IBBT, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Luc","lastName":"Knockaert","id":"37282795900"},{"name":"Tom Dhaene","affiliation":["Department of Information Technology, Ghent University - IBBT, Gent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Dhaene","id":"37273161400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0467-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0466-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Online ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0465-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898852","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":91},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit modelling","interpolation","matrix algebra","sensitivity analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensitivity analysis","data-driven parametric macromodels","parametric macromodeling","parameterized frequency behavior","interpolation scheme","state-space matrices"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898852","abstract":"An accurate parametric macromodeling method which builds the parameterized frequency behavior of systems from frequency data samples is presented.

In this paper we present an off-line Multiple Classifier System (MCS) for Arabic handwriting recognition. The MCS combine two individual recognition systems based on Fuzzy ART network used for the first time in Arabic OCR, and Radial Basis Functions. We use various feature sets based on Hu and Zernike Invariant moments. For deriving the final decision, different combining schemes are applied. The best combination ensemble has a recognition rate of 90,1 %, which is significantly higher than the 84,31% achieved by the best individual classifier. To demonstrate the high performance of the classification system, the results are compared with three research using IFN/ENIT database.","doi":"10.1109/ISPS.2011.5898872","startPage":"74","endPage":"79","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 10th International Symposium on Programming and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5871957/5898865/05898872.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 10th International Symposium on Programming and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPS.2011.5898872","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Combining neural networks for Arabic handwriting recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Subspace constraints","Feature extraction","Training","Artificial neural networks","Accuracy","Radial basis function networks","Handwriting recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ART neural nets","fuzzy neural nets","handwriting recognition","image classification","natural language processing","optical character recognition","radial basis function networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural networks","Arabic handwriting recognition","off line multiple classifier system","fuzzy ART network","Arabic OCR","radial basis function","feature set","Zernike invariant moment","Hu moment","IFN/ENIT database"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["classifier system","Arabic recognition","fuzzy ART network","RBF network","Hu momen","Zernike moment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898872/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 April 2011","displayDocTitle":"Combining neural networks for Arabic handwriting recognition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898872/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"25-27 April 2011","accessionNumber":"12071474","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Combining neural networks for Arabic handwriting recognition","confLoc":"Algiers, Algeria","sourcePdf":"Chergui7479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06803S","chronDate":"25-27 April 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5871957","isNumber":"5898865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5871957","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5898865","articleId":"5898872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5898899,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Belleschi","affiliation":["Departiment of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Belleschi","id":"37594911200"},{"name":"Paolo Detti","affiliation":["Departiment of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Detti","id":"37594911300"},{"name":"Andrea Abrardo","affiliation":["Departiment of Information Engineering, University of Sienna, Siena, Italy"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Abrardo","id":"37350346500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0024-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0025-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898899","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":212},"abstract":"In this paper, we address the problem of allocating users to radio resources (i.e. subcarriers) in the downlink of an OFDMA system.

We propose an integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem and exhaustively discuss the computational complexity. Specifically, we prove that the problem is NP-hard in the strong sense and demonstrate that it is hard to be approximated in polynomial time within a constant factor. Hence, we present heuristic approaches that achieve \u201creasonably good\u201d solutions in the general case. Computational experiences show that, in comparison with a commercial state-of-the-art ILP optimization solver, the proposed algorithms are effective in terms of solution quality and CPU times.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875053/5898895/05898899.pdf","startPage":"101","endPage":"106","publicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2011.5898899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2011.5898899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Complexity analysis and heuristic algorithms for radio resource allocation in OFDMA networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Resource management","Bandwidth","Heuristic algorithms","Complexity theory","Dynamic programming","Polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","frequency division multiple access","heuristic programming","integer programming","linear programming","OFDM modulation","polynomial approximation","radio links","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["complexity analysis","heuristic algorithm","radio resource allocation","OFDMA network","multiformat resource allocation problem","spectral efficiency","user subcarrier pair","radio link","transmission power","integer linear programming","computational complexity","NP-hard problem","polynomial time approximation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898899/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Complexity analysis and heuristic algorithms for radio resource allocation in OFDMA networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898899/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071592","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Complexity analysis and heuristic algorithms for radio resource allocation in OFDMA networks","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p101belleschi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063328S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898899","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898900,"authors":[{"name":"Arvind K.

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are often used in such areas. Normal WSN nodes are powered by batteries. Therefore, the lifetime is limited and the batteries have to be replaced manually after a certain period of time. This problem can be solved by EHSs. They exploit energy sources of the environment and store the harvested energy in energy buffers. The EHS supplies the electronic device and ensures a continuous operation. WSNs can benefit from these developments, because the lifetime can be enhanced dramatically. However, the EHS have to be adapted to the requirements of the application area and of the supplied device. This enhances the overall efficiency of EHS. To be able to do that, the fundamental mode of operation of an EHS has to be well-understood. We introduce a novel tier model for EHSs. It structures the EHS into tiers with special functions. This enhances the design process of an EHS, because tiers can be adapted to each other and the overall efficiency of can be increased. The tier model is applied to RiverMote, a WSN node for in-river water level monitoring. Each node is supplied by solar cells and the energy is stored in double layer capacitors (DLCs). The hardware of the EHS of RiverMote is divided into the tiers of the model. These tiers are adapted to each other carefully. Although no maximum power point tracker has been implemented, it has been shown that the available power of the solar cell is greater than 80% of the maximum power point if the energy level of the DLCs is between 42% and 100%. This result was only possible by a careful design and an adaption of the tiers.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875053/5898895/05898913.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"179","publicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898895","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2011.5898913","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2011.5898913","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898913","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Batteries","Photovoltaic cells","Current measurement","Energy measurement","Power measurement","Energy states"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting","maximum power point trackers","mobile radio","solar cells","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy harvesting system","autonomous WSN node","tier model","electronic device","wireless sensor network","energy source","EHS operation","design process","in-river water level monitoring","solar cell","double layer capacitor","maximum power point tracker"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898913/","displayDocTitle":"Designing of efficient energy harvesting systems for autonomous WSNs using a tier model","accessionNumber":"12071606","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898913/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Designing of efficient energy harvesting systems for autonomous WSNs using a tier model","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p174hormann.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125917S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898917,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Our resulting matrices differ from the renowned Welch Bound Equality (WBE) codes, regarding the fact that our attention is specifically aimed at binary, rather than Gaussian, input distributions. Since design based on channel capacity is computationally expensive, we have focused on introducing a set of alternative criteria that not only speed up the matrix formation procedure, but also maintain optimality. The Bit Error Rate (BER) and Constellation measures are our main criteria propositions. Simulation results also verify our analytical justifications.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Almost-optimum signature matrices in binary-input synchronous overloaded CDMA","publicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2011.5898917","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875053/5898895/05898917.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"200","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2011.5898917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Almost-optimum signature matrices in binary-input synchronous overloaded CDMA","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898917/","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071610","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Almost-optimum signature matrices in binary-input synchronous overloaded CDMA","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p195heidarikhoozani.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5898919,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Mousavi","affiliation":["Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI), Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Mousavi","id":"37847433100"},{"name":"Pedram Pad","affiliation":["Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI), Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Pedram","lastName":"Pad","id":"37542191400"},{"name":"Payam Delgosha","affiliation":["Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI), Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Payam","lastName":"Delgosha","id":"38015204200"},{"name":"Farokh Marvasti","affiliation":["Advanced Communications Research Institute (ACRI), Department of Electrical Engineering, Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farokh","lastName":"Marvasti","id":"37356612700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0024-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0025-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898919","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Multiaccess communication","Bit error rate","Noise","Iterative decoding","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","code division multiple access","error correction codes","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding","Poisson distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["errorless codes","decoding scheme","active user detection","binary codes","overloaded CDMA systems","errorless communication","maximum likelihood decoding","COWDA","bit error rate","Poisson distribution"]}],"abstract":"Recently, a new class of binary codes for overloaded CDMA systems are proposed that not only has the ability of errorless communication but also suitable for detecting active users.

However, due to the noisy sensed data of sensors and the wireless channel noise, it's difficult to guarantee the accuracy of detection, especially in multiple event detection. In this paper, we proposed a multiple event detection scheme using compressed sensing (CS). By analogy with CS problem, the efficient recovery algorithms of CS can be used to reconstruct the source signal that contains multiple simultaneous events. Moreover, the events may not change much, so the source signals at two adjacent time instants have high redundancy. This temporal correlation is also utilized in our scheme to improve the detection accuracy. In the proposed scheme, not only the position but also the value of an event can be achieved. Three algorithms of CS are used in our scheme to show the advantages on detection probability over the traditional decentralized detection methods using Bayesian.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875053/5898895/05898935.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"32","publicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2011.5898935","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2011.5898935","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898935","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple event detection in wireless sensor networks using compressed sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Event detection","Correlation","Noise","Compressed sensing","Thermal noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","correlation theory","noise","probability","signal detection","wireless channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event detection","wireless sensor networks","compressed sensing","noisy sensed data","wireless channel","temporal correlation","detection probability","Bayesian method","decentralized detection methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bayesian detection","compressed sensing","multiple event detection","wireless sensor networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898935/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Multiple event detection in wireless sensor networks using compressed sensing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898935/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071628","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple event detection in wireless sensor networks using compressed sensing","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p27liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059994S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898935","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5898939,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","id":"37599134900"},{"name":"Yumei Wang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yumei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37601146900"},{"name":"Qing Huang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Huang","id":"38025420700"},{"name":"Yu Liu","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, School of Information and Communication Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Liu","id":"37292038100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0024-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0025-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898939","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":230},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Silicon","Iterative decoding","Pixel","Quantization","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","computational complexity","decoding","parity check codes","video codecs","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC-based improved decoding scheme","distributed video codec","distributed video coding","low-density parity-check code","Wyner-Ziv coding","channel codes","DVC solutions","likelihood-ratio","initialization methods","LDPC iterative decoding","decoding complexity","PSNR gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["distributed video coding","Likelihood-ratio(LLR)","LDPC","confidence area"]}],"abstract":"Low-density Parity-Check (LDPC) code is widely used in distributed video coding (DVC) to realizing Wyner-Ziv (WZ) coding for its better performance than other channel codes.

The pixels in the SI correspond to different confidence areas, and the corresponding binary representations of the pixels will have different likelihood-ratio (LLR) initialization methods which are used to generate the LLR values for LDPC iterative decoding. The experimental results show that with the proposed decoding scheme the PSNR gain can reach up to 0.8 db without increasing the decoding complexity.","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2011.5898939","publicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875053/5898895/05898939.pdf","startPage":"298","endPage":"303","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2011.5898939","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898895","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898939","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An LDPC-based improved decoding scheme for distributed video codec","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898939/","displayDocTitle":"An LDPC-based improved decoding scheme for distributed video codec","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898939/","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071632","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An LDPC-based improved decoding scheme for distributed video codec","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p298li.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071085S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898939","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5898946,"authors":[{"name":"Sayed A.

However, accurate modeling of spectrum utilization is essential to obtain a better quantitative understanding of important concepts of CR systems. Compact mathematical formulations that describe the realistic spectrum usage would improve the recent theoretical work to a large extent. The data generated from such models would also increase the quality of the simulation based research in the aspect of realism. Besides, in practice, measurement campaigns would prefer if they could characterize results with a few well known parameters instead of exchanging large amount of data. Therefore, in this paper we try to come up with a mathematical model for the spectrum usage by estimating the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of the number of occupied channels. Note that this also gives an insight regarding the spectrum availability. To do this, the data collected from a spectrum occupancy measurement campaign conducted in the State of Qatar is used. The measurements are performed over three consecutive days considering 700-3000 MHz frequency band at four different locations concurrently. We show that after applying the Chi square test, the Log-Normal distribution fits the best among other candidates to the empirical PMF independent of location and the threshold used to define a channel as occupied.","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2011.5898947","publicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875053/5898895/05898947.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"37","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2011.5898947","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898895","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spatio-temporal measurement and model for number of occupied channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898947/","displayDocTitle":"Spatio-temporal measurement and model for number of occupied channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071640","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898947/","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spatio-temporal measurement and model for number of occupied channels","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p33qaraqe.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082238S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898949,"authors":[{"name":"Nele Noels","affiliation":["TELIN Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Nele","lastName":"Noels","id":"37269091200"},{"name":"Marc Moeneclaey","affiliation":["TELIN Department, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Moeneclaey","id":"37269902700"},{"name":"Frederik Simoens","affiliation":["Newtec Cy, Sint-Niklaas, Belgium"],"firstName":"Frederik","lastName":"Simoens","id":"37284099000"},{"name":"Daniel Delaruelle","affiliation":["Newtec Cy, Sint-Niklaas, Belgium"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Delaruelle","id":"38015289700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0024-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0025-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898949","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":99},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898949","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Tin","Detectors","Receivers","Phase locked loops","Image edge detection","Phase noise","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN","continuous phase modulation","expectation-maximisation algorithm","interleaved codes","maximum likelihood detection","modulation coding","phase locked loops","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative receiver","phase noise estimation","BIC","iterative detection","continuous phase modulation","CPM","additive white Gaussian noise","sum product algorithm","maximum a posteriori","bit detection","AWGN","expectation maximization algorithm","maximum likelihood estimation","phase locked loop","off-the-shelf","coherent bit detector","bit interleaved coded modulation"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers iterative detection of bit-interleaved coded continuous phase modulation in the presence of both phase noise (PN) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The proposed receiver iterates between a detection module and an estimation module. The detection module operates according to the sum-product algorithm and the factor graph framework in order to perform coherent maximum a posteriori bit detection in AWGN, using a PN estimate provided by the estimation module. The latter module, which results from the expectation-maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of the unknown PN samples, is implemented as a smoothing phase-locked loop that uses soft decisions provided by the detector. The full decoupling between the detection and the estimation processes allows the use of an off-the-shelf (coherent) bit detector.

To achieve space division multiple access, the newly introduced minimum probability of error (MPE) beamforming method is used instead of the conventional minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming. To increase the number of admitted users to the system, a new set of beamforming weight vectors is obtained for non-admitted users by minimizing their error probability conditioning on the detection of the admitted users. Moreover, a heuristic algorithm is presented to utilize the proposed detection-based minimum probability of error beamforming in a successive manner.

We explore the performance of standard PAPR reduction techniques and propose a novel PAPR reduction algorithm, based on sliding a time window across an extended SEFDM symbol period, therefore termed the SLiding Window (SLW) PAPR reduction technique. Numerical simulations confirm this new technique efficacy in PAPR reduction and show no side effects. Furthermore, a complete transmitter that employs SLW is proposed based on the SEFDM IDFT transmitter.

The compulsory spectrum sensing is a critical component to facilitate systems co-existence. In this paper, we propose a new Time-Division Energy Efficient (TDEE) sensing scheme in which the sensing period is divided into an optimal number of timeslots and each Secondary User (SU) is assigned to detect a different channel in one time-slot. An important advantage of TDEE is that the SUs do not need to exchange the control messages for the acknowledgement of a successful cooperation, leading to substantial energy saving without compromising sensing accuracy. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks are investigated with respect to the intrinsic trade-off between spectrum efficiency and energy-efficiency. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed TDEE is able to achieve much lower energy consumption compared to the existing mechanisms.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2011.5898956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898895","startPage":"38","endPage":"43","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875053/5898895/05898956.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient spectrum discovery with energy constraints in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898956/","displayDocTitle":"Efficient spectrum discovery with energy constraints in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071649","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient spectrum discovery with energy constraints in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p38liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048237S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5898965,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyi Xiong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Hongyi","lastName":"Xiong","id":"38025217700"},{"name":"Eliane Bodanese","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Queen''s Mary, University of London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Eliane","lastName":"Bodanese","id":"37444964300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0024-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0025-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898965","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Interference","Mobile communication","Mobile ad hoc networks","Resource management","Media Access Protocol"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","cochannel interference","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDMA","wireless ad hoc network","orthogonal frequency division multiple access","wireless network","signal strength-based medium access protocol","SSMAP","channel access","sub-channel allocation scheme"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Medium Access Protocol","OFDMA","subchannel allocation","wireless ad hoc networks"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) has been used as a multiple access scheme in many infrastructure based wireless networks, such as IEEE 802.16, 3GPP LTE etc. because of its prominent features. Interestingly, there are only a few proposals on implementing OFDMA in mobile ad hoc networks. In this paper, a Signal-Strength based Medium Access Protocol (SSMAP) is proposed to orchestrate the channel access in OFDMA based mobile ad hoc networks. SSMAP introduces a sub-channel selection criterion which is based on the interference power of the subchannels in the receiver side aiming to reduce the co-channel interference and reduce the signaling overhead. The proposed sub-channel allocation scheme is fully distributed and each node does not need to exchange periodic update information with its neighbors. The simulation results illustrate the major performance advantages of SSMAP compared to prior channel access protocols, such as signal-radio multi-channel and multi-radio multi-channel in wireless ad hoc networks.","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2011.5898965","publicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875053/5898895/05898965.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2011.5898965","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898895","startPage":"439","endPage":"443","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A signal strength based medium access control for OFDMA based wireless ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898965","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A signal strength based medium access control for OFDMA based wireless ad hoc networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898965/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12071658","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5898965/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A signal strength based medium access control for OFDMA based wireless ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p439xiong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064794S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898965","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898967,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhao","lastName":"Li","id":"37597745900"},{"name":"Qin Liu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Qin","lastName":"Liu","id":"37277488000"},{"name":"Linjing Zhao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Integrated Service Networks, Xidian University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Linjing","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37279828400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0024-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0025-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898967","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"abstract":"This paper investigates multi-antenna cognitive radio system, designs signal processing algorithms for cognitive uplink transmission, and proposes an opportunistic spectrum access scheme based on space division multiplexing (SDM-OSA).

Spectrum handover happens when the primary users and secondary users collide on the same spectrum hole, and the secondary users need to switch to other spectrum holes to continue the communication. Therefore, the reliability of spectrum Q-learning handover, which is reflected by the quality of service of secondary users and the reduction of interference of primary users, needs deeper research. This paper proposes the scheme of Anticipated Spectrum Handover Scheme (ASHS), which models the primary channel with the consideration of the activity of secondary users based on renewal theory. Secondary users would anticipate the trigger of spectrum handover and select proper spectrum hole as the target one according to the anticipation. The simulation results show that the drop ratio of secondary users is decreased and the frequency of spectrum handovers and passive handovers are decreased.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898977/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12071670","htmlLink":"/document/5898977/","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Anticipated spectrum handover in cognitive radios","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anticipated spectrum handover in cognitive radios","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p49wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072028S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898977","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898982,"authors":[{"name":"Shashika Biyanwilage","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Western Ontario, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Shashika","lastName":"Biyanwilage","id":"37847361300"},{"name":"Upul Gunawardana","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Western Ontario, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Upul","lastName":"Gunawardana","id":"37294101900"},{"name":"Ranjith Liyanapathirana","affiliation":["School of Engineering, University of Western Ontario, Penrith, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Ranjith","lastName":"Liyanapathirana","id":"37372854300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0024-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0025-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898982","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":216},"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the relay selection, sub-carrier pairing, and power allocation problems in a two-hop, multi-relay-assisted cooperative OFDM system with amplify-and-forward (AF) relays.

novel approach based on Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) is proposed for scheduling in opportunistic beamforming (OBF) systems. By jointly optimizing among system throughput, fairness and time delay of each user, the proposed algorithm can achieve larger system throughput and lower average time delay with approximately the same fairness and acceptable complexity, as compared with the proportional fair scheduler (PFS). Furthermore, unlike the case in PFS, the parameter used for tradeoff between system throughput and fairness is valid for various practical settings, since the weight that each user accounts for in the base station's (BS) choice can be appropriately calculated in DSmT's framework. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithm outperforms PFS and other conventional scheduling algorithms in terms of the four proposed indexes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898983/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12071676","htmlLink":"/document/5898983/","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"DSmT based scheduling algorithm in opportunistic beamforming systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DSmT based scheduling algorithm in opportunistic beamforming systems","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p534long.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053537S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898983","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":5898985,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Enqing","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics and Information Engineering, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Enqing","id":"37728156400"},{"name":"Chai Yanze","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics and Information Engineering, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Chai","lastName":"Yanze","id":"38015038100"},{"name":"Liu Xiaojun","affiliation":["School of Mechatronics and Information Engineering, Shandong University, China"],"firstName":"Liu","lastName":"Xiaojun","id":"37545151000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0024-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0025-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898985","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":402},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Equations","Wireless sensor networks","Measurement uncertainty","Mathematical model","Optimization","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least squares approximations","particle swarm optimisation","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["three-dimensional localization algorithm","wireless sensor networks","particle swarm optimization","PSO","WSN","three-dimensional localization objective function","distance equation set","beacon node analysis","least square algorithm","BFGS algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5898985","abstract":"The paper presents a three-dimensional localization algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). According to a direct proportion relationship of the measured distance with the measuring errors, an improved three-dimensional localization objective function is defined with weighted the measured distance, and which is optimized by using PSO. In the process of solving the measured distance equations set which is an overdetermined system of equations, for reducing the order of the equations, the minimum distance equation in the system of equations is selected to subtract other equations instead of random selection. The simulation results show that the process can reduce localization errors. The effects of the amount and the distribution of the beacon nodes are analyzed, and the experimental results show that the localization errors under the marginal distribution of the beacon nodes are smaller than that one under the random distribution of the beacon nodes. The final simulation results indicate that the proposed three-dimensional localization algorithm has a higher accuracy and lower affection of the non-line-of-sight error than the least square algorithm and the BFGS (Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, Shanno) algorithm, but the proposed algorithm is at cost of more localization time.","doi":"10.1109/CTS.2011.5898985","startPage":"55","endPage":"60","publicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2011.5898985","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5898895","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 18th International Conference on Telecommunications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5875053/5898895/05898985.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel three-dimensional localization algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks based on Particle Swarm Optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5898985/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A novel three-dimensional localization algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks based on Particle Swarm Optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5898985/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"12071678","publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"8-11 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 May 2011","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel three-dimensional localization algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks based on Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Ayia Napa, Cyprus","sourcePdf":"p55dong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057823S","chronDate":"8-11 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5875053","isNumber":"5898895","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5875053","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5898895","articleId":"5898985","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":5898987,"authors":[{"name":"Ruohan Cao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ruohan","lastName":"Cao","id":"38028640400"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189000"},{"name":"Hui Gao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hui","lastName":"Gao","id":"37403296700"},{"name":"Pengfei Chang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Pengfei","lastName":"Chang","id":"37589748800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0024-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4577-0025-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5898987","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Reliability","Complexity theory","Cities and towns","Ant colony optimization","Wireless communication","Estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","optimisation","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ant colony optimization","MIMO systems","detection schemes","multiple-input multiple-output systems"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes two detection schemes based on a novel strategy associated with ant colony optimization (ACO) for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

By increasing the number of users, it is shown in that for single-antenna BSs, using interference alignment, each cell can approach the interference-free degrees of freedom (DOF) provided that the bandwidth is sufficiently large. But as the number of users grows, the correlation between adjacent subcarriers increases and this degrades the performance of interference alignment.

computation capability. In this work, we proposed an embedded FPGA-based visual servoing platform (VSP) to meet the requirements on data transfer and computation capability for quick response visual servoing tasks. To address the data transfer capability issue, we adopted coprocessor-like system architecture, which provided direct connections between vision processing IPs and peripheral modules. To address the computation capability issue, we exploit as much parallelism within vision processing algorithms as possible to ensure high visual information update frequency. Two visual servoing tasks that required quick response, a ball catching and a high speed target shooting tasks, were chosen to verify the applicability and effectiveness of the VSP. In the ball catching case, we achieved 85% catch success rate and 58Hz visual update frequency. In the high speed target shooting case, we achieved 91% average hit rate and 402 Hz visual update frequency.","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5876182/5899042/05899082.pdf","startPage":"263","endPage":"268","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5899042","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5899082","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based embedded visual servoing platform for quick response visual servoing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Visual servoing","Cameras","Computer architecture","IP networks","Visualization","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","field programmable gate arrays","mobile robots","visual servoing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based embedded visual servoing platform","quick response visual servoing","VSP","computation capability","data transfer capability","coprocessor-like system architecture","vision processing IP","ball catching","mobile robots"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5899082/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based embedded visual servoing platform for quick response visual servoing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5899082/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"12072526","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based embedded visual servoing platform for quick response visual servoing","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"MoA81.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061339S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5876182","isNumber":"5899042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876182","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5899042","articleId":"5899082","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asian Control Association","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":5899130,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiguo Yan","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Zhiguo","lastName":"Yan","id":"38021989900"},{"name":"Guoshan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Guoshan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37538430600"},{"name":"Jiankui Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"firstName":"Jiankui","lastName":"Wang","id":"37538999500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-487-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-956056-4-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5899130","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":93},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Artificial neural networks","Stability analysis","Stochastic systems","Asymptotic stability","Symmetric matrices","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear differential equations","linear matrix inequalities","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability","state-space methods","stochastic systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonfragile robust finite-time stabilization","uncertain nonlinear stochastic systems","multilayer feedback neural networks","linear differential inclusion","state-space representation","nonfragile state feedback finite-time stabilization","optimization problem","linear matrix inequalities"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5899130","abstract":"This paper deals with the problem of non-fragile robust finite-time stabilization for a class of uncertain nonlinear stochastic systems via neural network.

Next, we resolve the optimal STLF with the FNNs derived. The results by the proposed method are compared with that by other commonly-used load forecasting methods, such as the Artificial Neural Network, the Evolutionary Programming combined with ANN (EP-ANN) and the Genetic Algorithm combined with ANN (GA-ANN).

A practical system is given to illustrate the validity of the proposed scheme.","startPage":"1176","endPage":"1180","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5876182/5899042/05899239.pdf","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5899042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based observer and adaptive control design for a class of singularly perturbed nonlinear systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Observers","Artificial neural networks","Adaptive control","Nonlinear systems","Linear matrix inequalities","Stability analysis","Iron"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","control system synthesis","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov matrix equations","neural nets","nonlinear control systems","observers","singularly perturbed systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based observer","adaptive control design","singularly perturbed nonlinear systems","Lyapunov stability theorem","linear matrix inequality","controller gain matrix","positive-definite matrix","SPN systems","allowable perturbation bound","algebra inequalities"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Linear matrix inequality","Lyapunov stability theorem","neural network based observer and adaptive control design","singularly perturbed nonlinear systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5899239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based observer and adaptive control design for a class of singularly perturbed nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5899239/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","accessionNumber":"12072682","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based observer and adaptive control design for a class of singularly perturbed nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"TuB74.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058064S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5876182","isNumber":"5899042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876182","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5899042","articleId":"5899239","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asian Control Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":5899240,"authors":[{"name":"Ozkan Cigdem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Ozkan","lastName":"Cigdem","id":"37705889400"},{"name":"Erdal Kayacan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Erdal","lastName":"Kayacan","id":"37595300900"},{"name":"Okyay Kaynak","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Okyay","lastName":"Kaynak","id":"38179731500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-61284-487-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-89-956056-4-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5899240","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy neural networks","Fuzzy control","Uncertainty","DC motors","Fuzzy logic","Control systems","Torque"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy set theory","learning (artificial intelligence)","load regulation","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","servomechanisms","stability","time-varying systems","uncertain systems","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["interval type-2 fuzzy neural network","sliding mode online learning algorithm","fuzzy sliding mode controllers","control system uncertainty","type-1 fuzzy set","membership function","model uncertainty type-2 fuzzy logic system","sliding mode control-based algorithm","real-time control application","cost function","learning parameter","error tuning","parameter update rule","Lyapunov function","real-time laboratory setup","time varying load condition","nonlinear load condition","servo system control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5899240","abstract":"In industry, fuzzy controllers and fuzzy sliding mode controllers have a variety of applications to handle uncertainties in control systems. Even though type-1 fuzzy sets are generally used to construct the membership functions of these controllers, through their capability to better model uncertainties type-2 fuzzy logic systems may provide more accurate results. The use of a sliding mode control-based algorithm for the training of type-2 fuzzy neural networks makes this paper the first study in the concerned field to work in a real-time control application. Instead of trying to minimize a cost function, the learning parameters are tuned so that the error is enforced to satisfy a stable equation. The parameter update rules for a type-2 fuzzy neural network with two inputs and one output are derived, and the stability of the proposed learning algorithm is proven via a Lyapunov function. This algorithm is applied to a real-time laboratory setup with time-varying and nonlinear load conditions. The real-time results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in controlling the servo system under the disturbances and uncertainties.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5876182/5899042/05899240.pdf","startPage":"1181","endPage":"1186","displayPublicationTitle":"2011 8th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","publicationTitle":"2011 8th Asian Control Conference (ASCC)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5899042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experimental study of an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network using sliding-mode online learning algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5899240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-18 May 2011","displayDocTitle":"Experimental study of an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network using sliding-mode online learning algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 June 2011","accessionNumber":"12072683","publicationDate":"May 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5899240/","conferenceDate":"15-18 May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experimental study of an interval type-2 fuzzy neural network using sliding-mode online learning algorithm","confLoc":"Kaohsiung, Taiwan","sourcePdf":"TuB75.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077892S","chronDate":"15-18 May 2011","xplore-pub-id":"5876182","isNumber":"5899042","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5876182","xplore-issue":"5899042","articleId":"5899240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Asian Control Association","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"}]
