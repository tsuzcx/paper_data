Experiment results show that the presented method can restore the space variant blurred images effectively, and its power of suppressing noise is strong also.","doi":"10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4590046","startPage":"330","endPage":"334","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4590046","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589950","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579619/4589950/04590046.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A blind image restoration method based on the genetic algorithm and the fuzzy control","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4590046/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A blind image restoration method based on the genetic algorithm and the fuzzy control","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4590046/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10155599","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A blind image restoration method based on the genetic algorithm and the fuzzy control","confLoc":"Shanghai","sourcePdf":"0199.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050038S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579619","isNumber":"4589950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579619","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4589950","articleId":"4590046","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4590076,"authors":[{"name":"HaiBing Yin","affiliation":["Institute of Digital media, Peking University, China","Information Engineering Department, China Jiliang University, China"],"lastName":"HaiBing Yin","id":"37393998500"},{"name":"DongPing Zhang","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, China Jiliang University, China"],"lastName":"DongPing Zhang","id":"37597917900"},{"name":"XiuMin Wang","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, China Jiliang University, China"],"lastName":"XiuMin Wang","id":"37066313000"},{"name":"ZheLei Xia","affiliation":["Information Engineering Department, China Jiliang University, China"],"lastName":"ZheLei Xia","id":"38079739300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1723-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1724-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4590076","dbTime":"31 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Computer architecture","Prediction algorithms","Hardware","Buffer storage","Indexes","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","integrated circuit testing","logic testing","motion compensation","pipeline processing","table lookup","video coding","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["H.264 video decoder","MV prediction algorithm","VLSI architecture","complex control logic","table lookup","pipeline processing","function verification"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4590076","abstract":"Variable block sizes, complex spatial motion vector prediction, particular skip and direct temporal MV prediction contribute to superior performance of H.264 standard.

Complex control logic is simplified by regularly lookuping control parameters in a predefined table. The parameters of the current MB and neighboring blocks are also initialized and updated regularly. Pipeline and parallelism are jointly employed in the proposed architecture to shorten the processing time and minimize hardware consumption. Moreover, highly regular architecture also simplifies the function verification considerably.

This TRHKNN consists of ldquofastrdquo Kohonen neural network (FKNN), ldquomiddlerdquo Kohonen neural network (MKNN) and ldquoslowrdquo Kohonen neural network (SKNN). The received TRHKNN has not only high speed of image recognition, but also high speed of image restoration. This approach demonstrates that the proposed TRHKNN is capable not only to identify the distorted image of fingerprint but also to restore the undistorted image of fingerprint. These examples with simulations by MATLAB/Simulink environment show the computing procedure and applicability of TRHKNN for fast-acting fingerprint image recognition in distorted fingertip surface conditions.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4590098/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4590098/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10155651","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fingerprint recognition for varied degrees of image distortion using three-rate hybrid Kohonen neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fingerprint recognition for varied degrees of image distortion using three-rate hybrid Kohonen neural network","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0278.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07532S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579619","isNumber":"4589950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579619","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4589950","articleId":"4590098","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4590117,"authors":[{"name":"Ren-Jean Liou","affiliation":["Department of Computers and Communications, National Pingtung Institute of Technology, Ping Tung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ren-Jean Liou","id":"37087213040"},{"name":"Juping Wu","affiliation":["College of Management, Shu Te University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Juping Wu","id":"37088161842"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1723-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1724-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4590117","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4590117","abstract":"Image compression is an essential task for image storage and transmission.

The sub-band scheme is utilized to separate the DC and AC coefficients in order to reduce the learning complexity of Kohonen networks. SOM is used in this paper to generate codebook for vector quantization (VQ). It has the advantages of preserving the topological property that generate ordered codebook with substantial dimension reduction. The consequence makes image compression even more effective.

Simulation results verify the validity of proposed multi-inconsecutive-frames moving average method for frequency domain CMBSS.","doi":"10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4590201","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Audio, Language and Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579619/4589950/04590201.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALIP.2008.4590201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4589950","startPage":"11","endPage":"16","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-inconsecutive-frames moving average for the frequency-domain blind source separation of convolutive mixtures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4590201","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-inconsecutive-frames moving average for the frequency-domain blind source separation of convolutive mixtures","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4590201/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10155753","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4590201/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-inconsecutive-frames moving average for the frequency-domain blind source separation of convolutive mixtures","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054528S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579619","isNumber":"4589950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579619","xplore-issue":"4589950","articleId":"4590201","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4590207,"authors":[{"name":"Yunzhou Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science & Engineering, Northeastern University, China"],"lastName":"Yunzhou Zhang","id":"37310459100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1723-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1724-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4590207","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"abstract":"Aiming at the property of robot duty, this paper designed a monocular vision system.

Because of the problem complexity, we have explored the use of genetic algorithms with restricted search for the mentioned feature selection. In an effort to evaluate its performance, the algorithm has been compared to a standard unconstrained genetic algorithm and with sequential methods. The restricted search driven by the proposed algorithm performs better than both the sequential methods and unconstrained genetic algorithms. The proposed algorithm selects a feature subset composed of only 21 features, much smaller than the 76 features of the complete, original set of available features. This low-cardinality subset of signal-describing features is the one implemented on the hearing aid, saving thus a great number of the scarce computational resources, and making possible to put into practice the concept at reasonable cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4590248/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10155800","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4590248/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"7-9 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Reducing the computational cost for sound classification in hearing aids by selecting features via genetic algorithms with restricted search","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing the computational cost for sound classification in hearing aids by selecting features via genetic algorithms with restricted search","confLoc":"Shanghai, China","sourcePdf":"0506.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075206S","chronDate":"7-9 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579619","isNumber":"4589950","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579619","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4589950","articleId":"4590248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4590298,"authors":[{"name":"Farideh Fazayeli","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Farideh","lastName":"Fazayeli","id":"38093775600"},{"name":"Lipo Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Lipo Wang","id":"37087219415"},{"name":"Wen Liu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore"],"lastName":"Wen Liu","id":"37086478231"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2310-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2311-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4590298","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":140},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4590298","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Classification algorithms","Training","Neurons","Ionosphere","Artificial neural networks","Simulated annealing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","chaos","feedforward neural nets","minimisation","training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos","feed-forward neural networks","minimization","error function","multilayer networks","backpropagation","randomicity","ergodicity","learning algorithm","classification tasks","ionosphere datasets","Wincson breast cancer dataset","credit-screening dataset","training method"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590298","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579541/4590296/04590298.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4590296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Back-propagation with chaos","abstract":"Multilayer feed-forward neural networks are widely used based on minimization of an error function.

To avoid this problem, we propose a new back-propagation training based on chaos. We investigate whether randomicity and ergodicity property of chaos can enable the learning algorithm to escape from local minima. Validity of the proposed method is examined by performing simulations on three real classification tasks, namely, the Ionosphere, the Wincson Breast Cancer (WBC), and the credit-screening datasets.

In this paper, a closed-form solution is developed for semi-blind channel estimation of MIMO-OFDM systems. An appealing scheme for the computation of the weighting factor is proposed, leading to an analytical expression for the weighting factor in terms the MSE (mean square error) of the training-based criterion and that of the blind part.

However, the permutation problem arises: the permutation ambiguity of ICA in each frequency bin should be aligned so that a separated signal in the time-domain contains frequency components of the same source signal. In this paper, we present a new method for solving the permutation problem using microphone sub-arrays. It is based on the combination of two approaches: direction of arrival (DOA) estimation for sources and the inter-frequency correlation of signal envelopes. First, DOA estimation is performed using microphone sub-arrays so that the permutation problem is solved more robustly in low frequencies. Second, we exploit the correlation between the adjacent bins to fix the permutation for the remaining frequencies. Experimental results show that the proposed method provided a more robust solution to the permutation problem in a real acoustic environment.","doi":"10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590311","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579541/4590296/04590311.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590311","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4590296","startPage":"67","endPage":"72","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving permutation problem in frequency-domain blind source separation using microphone sub-arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4590311","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Solving permutation problem in frequency-domain blind source separation using microphone sub-arrays","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4590311/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155372","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4590311/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving permutation problem in frequency-domain blind source separation using microphone sub-arrays","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047022S","chronDate":"7-11 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579541","isNumber":"4590296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579541","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4590296","articleId":"4590311","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4590319,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-tao Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yong-tao Ma","id":"37533398100"},{"name":"Kai-hua Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Kai-hua Liu","id":"37421347000"},{"name":"Jian-feng Duan","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Jian-feng Duan","id":"38080207900"},{"name":"Yu-na Song","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yu-na Song","id":"38090782700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2310-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2311-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4590319","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":220},"abstract":"OFDM system can improve frequency band utility, decrease symbols interference caused by multi-path effect.

In this paper, we propose a low-cost precoding scheme, which only needs partial channel state information on a fraction of all subcarriers. Channel state information on other subcarriers is recovered by interpolating and making full use of channel frequency-domain correlations. Thus multiuser zero-forcing precoding can be simply implemented on all subcarriers. The proposed scheme not only significantly reduces the feedback bits, but also effectively cancels multiuser cochannel interference.","doi":"10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590340","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579541/4590296/04590340.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4590296","startPage":"205","endPage":"209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interpolation-based multiuser precoding for MIMO-OFDM system with limited feedback","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4590340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Interpolation-based multiuser precoding for MIMO-OFDM system with limited feedback","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4590340/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"7-11 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155401","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4590340/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interpolation-based multiuser precoding for MIMO-OFDM system with limited feedback","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"070.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04337S","chronDate":"7-11 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579541","isNumber":"4590296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579541","xplore-issue":"4590296","articleId":"4590340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4590345,"authors":[{"name":"Yong-tao Ma","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yong-tao Ma","id":"37087219561"},{"name":"Kai-hua Liu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Kai-hua Liu","id":"37087218972"},{"name":"Yi-na Guo","affiliation":["School of Electronic Information Engineering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yi-na Guo","id":"37087220193"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2310-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2311-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4590345","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":442},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4590345","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Computational modeling","Attenuation","Mathematical model","Power systems","Neurons","Analytical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","multipath channels","neural nets","telecommunication computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","power-line communication","multipath channel","high-level design","data transmission","information exchange","power-line channel","multipath propagation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel Modeling","Artificial Neural Network","Power-line Communication","Multi-path"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590345","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579541/4590296/04590345.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","startPage":"229","endPage":"232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4590296","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural network modeling approach to power-line communication multi-path channel","abstract":"A trained neural network can be used for high-level design, providing fast and accurate answers to the task it has learned.

Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) interference coordination scheme is proposed in 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE). But the scheme cause frequency selective scheduling gain loss, and the peak rate for cell edge users is low because the cell edge users only can use a fraction of the entire frequency band.

In this paper, we combine the vector precoding with GMD for channel matrix to design the transceiver for MIMO transmission system. Under the proposed transceiver structure, the minimum square error (MSE) of receive symbols are obtained. To minimize the MSE, two schemes in terms of perturbation vector are proposed. In the first scheme, the perturbation vector has only continuous values, thus it is regarded as interference for MSE. In the second scheme, the perturbation vector is generalized to have both continuous and discrete values, so it is partially dealt with as interference after modulo operation. In these two schemes, the optimum perturbation vectors are presented in MMSE criterion respectively.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579541/4590296/04590356.pdf","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590356","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4590296","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4590356","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector precoding based on Geometric Mean Decomposition for MIMO transmission system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transceivers","Gain","Receivers","Interference","Transmitters","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","precoding","transceivers","vectors","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector precoding","geometric mean decomposition","MIMO transmission system","channel matrix","transceiver design","minimum square error method","perturbation vector","MMSE"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Vector precoding","MIMO","GMD"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4590356/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Vector precoding based on Geometric Mean Decomposition for MIMO transmission system","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4590356/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155417","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector precoding based on Geometric Mean Decomposition for MIMO transmission system","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"100.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058499S","chronDate":"7-11 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579541","isNumber":"4590296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579541","xplore-issue":"4590296","articleId":"4590356","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4590360,"authors":[{"name":"Enfang Sang","affiliation":["Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, CN"],"firstName":"Enfang","lastName":"Sang","id":"37562061900"},{"name":"Xiaoka Xu","affiliation":["College of Underwater Acoustic Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Heilongjiang, 150001, China"],"firstName":"Xiaoka","lastName":"Xu","id":"38238207100"},{"name":"Gang Qiao","affiliation":["College of Underwater Acoustic Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Heilongjiang, 150001, China"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37668526900"},{"name":"Jun Su","affiliation":["College of Underwater Acoustic Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Heilongjiang, 150001, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Su","id":"37881349300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2310-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2311-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4590360","dbTime":"36 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":273},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Underwater acoustics","Channel estimation","Bandwidth","Time frequency analysis","Baseband","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","Monte Carlo methods","OFDM modulation","Toeplitz matrices","underwater acoustic communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ZP-OFDM","underwater acoustic communication","CP-OFDM","overlap-add method","channel nulls","underwater acoustic channel","channel equalization","channel transfer matrix","Toeplitz matrix","transmission power","Monte-Carlo simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Channel equalization","Spectral nulls"]}],"abstract":"Recent years, OFDM is attempted to use in underwater acoustic communication.

In each dimension of a particle, we randomly generate a black hole located nearest to the best particle of the swarm in current generation and then randomly pull particles of the swarm into the black hole with a probability p. By this mechanism of random black hole, we can give all the particles another interesting direction to converge as well as another chance to fly out of local minima when a premature convergence happens. Several experiments on fifteen benchmark test functions are conducted to demonstrate that the proposed RBH-PSO algorithm is able to speedup the evolution process distinctly and improve the performance of global optimizer greatly. Finally, an actual application of the proposed algorithm to spam detection is conducted then compared to other three current methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590372","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579541/4590296/04590372.pdf","startPage":"359","endPage":"365","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590372","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4590296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random black hole particle swarm optimization and its application","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4590372/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Random black hole particle swarm optimization and its application","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10155433","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4590372/","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random black hole particle swarm optimization and its application","confLoc":"Nanjing","sourcePdf":"126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060051S","chronDate":"7-11 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579541","isNumber":"4590296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579541","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4590296","articleId":"4590372","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4590378,"authors":[{"name":"Zaifeng Shi","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engeering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Zaifeng Shi","id":"37087365372"},{"name":"Suying Yao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engeering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Suying Yao","id":"37087163021"},{"name":"Yingchun Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engeering, Tianjin University of Commerce, TJCU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yingchun Zhao","id":"37087365050"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2310-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2311-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4590378","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"abstract":"Traditional image scaling algorithms generally was based on perfect original images which had not any noise.

It\u2019s a effective way to measure the LST by remote sensing data. But, The radiance leaving the earth-atmosphere system which can be sensed by a satellite borne radiometer is the sum of radiation emission from the earth surface and each atmospheric level that are transmitted to the top of the atmosphere. It can be separated from the radiance at the top of the atmospheric level measured by radiometer. However, it is very difficult to measure the atmospheric radiance, especially the synchronous measurement with the satellite. In this paper, based on the knowledge of atmospheric radiative transfer, the moderate spectral resolution atmospheric transmittance algorithm and computer model is selected to model the atmosphere.

Unlike previous reports about SMC sampling that widely sequentially draw samples and process each sample independently, we present a novel sampling method which collaboratively processes all samples and extracts information from a collection of samples to establish the sampling space to draw next samples. Simultaneously, the proposed method adopts a reselection step to save storage resource and decrease computation burden. Simulations indicate that the proposed solution decreases the necessary amount of samples and improves the system performance compared with the classical SMC detector. The revised detector is also compared with sphere decoding (SD) that has the comparable computation burden, and simulation result shows that it can obtain the same performance as SD with lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590442","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Neural Networks and Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4579541/4590296/04590442.pdf","startPage":"705","endPage":"710","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICNNSP.2008.4590442","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4590296","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low-complexity implementation of sampling-based MIMO detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4590442","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4590442/","displayDocTitle":"A low-complexity implementation of sampling-based MIMO detection","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155502","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4590442/","conferenceDate":"7-11 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low-complexity implementation of sampling-based MIMO detection","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"293.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086032S","chronDate":"7-11 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4579541","isNumber":"4590296","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4579541","xplore-issue":"4590296","articleId":"4590442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4590505,"authors":[{"name":"Yukiyoshi Kamio","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yukiyoshi Kamio","id":"37273279600"},{"name":"Moriya Nakamura","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Moriya Nakamura","id":"37310472300"},{"name":"Tetsuya Miyazaki","affiliation":["National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, Koganei, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Tetsuya Miyazaki","id":"37277957400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1925-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1926-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1099-4742"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-8614"}],"articleNumber":"4590505","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":125},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Equalizers","Constellation diagram","Receivers","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Finite impulse response filter","Light sources"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital filters","equalisers","intersymbol interference","modulators","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vector modulator","electronic pre-equalization","intersymbol-interference","16-QAM","digital filtering"]}],"abstract":"We investigated the performance of electronic pre-equalization to compensate for inter-symbol-interference in electrical 16-QAM in a vector modulator.

When evaluating the compatibility of ester oils with existing transformer insulation designs, it is essential to not only compare the mean breakdown voltages of the oils, but also to consider the role of dispersion and thus the withstand voltage levels (with the acceptable breakdown likelihood). Insulation designers sometimes estimate the withstand voltage of mineral oil from the dispersion of the data, assuming that the breakdown voltages of the oil follow a parametric distribution. However, there is a lack of discussion as to whether this method would be suitable for estimating the withstand voltages of ester oils. This paper uses samples of breakdown voltages of a synthetic ester, a natural ester and a mineral oil to analyze their distributions, and discusses the applicability of using Weibull and Gaussian distributions to estimate the withstand voltages of the esters. It is found that the distributions of ester breakdown voltages, in particular the lowest breakdown voltage, are similar to those of mineral oil. Consequently there is evidence that from the ac withstand voltage point of view the tested esters are compatible for the use in power transformers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4591205/04591226.pdf","startPage":"1044","endPage":"1050","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2008.4591226","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2008.4591226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591205","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4591226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical analysis of the AC breakdown voltages of ester based transformer oils","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Statistical analysis","Oil insulation","Power transformer insulation","Breakdown voltage","Petroleum","Power transformers","Minerals","Dielectrics and electrical insulation","Gaussian distribution","Testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric materials","electric breakdown","insulating oils","power transformer insulation","statistical analysis","transformer oil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["statistical analysis","AC breakdown voltages","ester based transformer oils","transformer insulation designs","breakdown voltages","breakdown likelihood","Gaussian distributions","Weibull distributions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dielectric breakdown, oil insulation, statistics, power transformers"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591226/","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Statistical analysis of the AC breakdown voltages of ester based transformer oils","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4591226/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178237","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical analysis of the AC breakdown voltages of ester based transformer oils","sourcePdf":"p1044-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085979S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4591205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"78","xplore-issue":"4591205","articleId":"4591226","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4591236,"authors":[{"name":"Andrew J.

This form of degradation is ultimately fatal for affected cables, and therefore the detection of damaging trees in power cable insulation is vital for distribution companies to avoid catastrophic failure. Dielectric response measurements, in both the time and frequency domains, can generate valuable information about the condition of the cable. However, the interpretation of how these dielectric response measurements relate to water tree density and length is a difficult task. This paper will present a new dielectric response model for water tree degraded XLPE insulation. The model is based on finite element analysis to determine the electrical behaviour of water tree degraded insulation. Preliminary simulations will verify the model development by comparing the results to small sample pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) measurements performed by other researchers. The importance of a strong non-linearity mechanism for accurate modelling will also be elucidated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591205","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TDEI.2008.4591236","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel5/94/4591205/04591236.pdf","startPage":"1131","endPage":"1143","doi":"10.1109/TDEI.2008.4591236","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new dielectric response model for water tree degraded XLPE insulation - part a: model development with small sample verification","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"August  2008","displayDocTitle":"A new dielectric response model for water tree degraded XLPE insulation - part a: model development with small sample verification","volume":"15","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4591236/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"August 2008","accessionNumber":"10178247","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591236/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new dielectric response model for water tree degraded XLPE insulation - part a: model development with small sample verification","sourcePdf":"p1131-thomas.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09506S","chronDate":"August  2008","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4591205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"4591205","articleId":"4591236","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4591239,"authors":[{"name":"A.

One of the recent approaches that have gained some acceptance within the research arena is the Wavelet multi- resolution analysis (WMRA). However selecting an accurate mother wavelet, defining dynamic threshold values and identifying the resolution levels to be considered in the PD extraction from the noise are still challenging tasks. This paper proposes a novel wavelet-based technique for extracting PD signals embedded in high noise levels. The proposed technique enhances the WMRA by decomposing the noisy data into different resolution levels while sliding it into Kaiser's window. Only the maximum expansion coefficients at each resolution level are used in de-noising and measuring the extracted PD signal. A small set of coefficients is used in the monitoring process without assigning threshold values or performing signal reconstruction. The proposed monitoring technique has been applied to a laboratory data as well as to a simulated PD pulses embedded in a collected laboratory noise.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591239/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4591239/","accessionNumber":"10178250","displayDocTitle":"On-line detection and measurement of partial discharge signals in a noisy environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line detection and measurement of partial discharge signals in a noisy environment","sourcePdf":"p1162-gaouda.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121134S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"94","isNumber":"4591205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"94","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4591205","articleId":"4591239","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4591265,"authors":[{"name":"Heung-Gyoon Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heung-Gyoon","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37278285300"},{"name":"Sang Burm Ryu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Burm","lastName":"Ryu","id":"37652137100"},{"name":"Seon-Ae Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chungbuk National University, Chungbuk, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seon-Ae","lastName":"Kim","id":"37715231900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3274-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4591265","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":41,"totalDownloads":733},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Antennas","Peak to average power ratio","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","block codes","channel allocation","diversity reception","error statistics","fast Fourier transforms","MIMO communication","multifrequency antennas","OFDM modulation","orthogonal codes","receiving antennas","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM communication system","carrier interferometry orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","orthogonal spreading codes","peak to average power ratio reduction","frequency diversity gains","communication throughput","transmit antennas","receive antennas","two Tx-two Rx antennas configuration","multiple input multiple output antenna array systems","space frequency block coding","carrier allocation","inverse fast Fourier transform","IFFT type operation","signal spectrum","BER improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","MIMO","SFBC","CI-OFDM","PAPR"]}],"abstract":"The CI-OFDM (carrier interferometry orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) CI-OFDM system spreads each information symbol across all N sub-carriers using orthogonal CI spreading codes.

In this paper, focusing on the two Tx (transmit) / one Rx (receive) antennas and two Tx / two Rx antennas configuration in the MIMO (multiple input multiple output) antenna array systems, we like to design and evaluate the performance of this MIMO CI-OFDM system. SFBC (space frequency block coding) coding is used for the MIMO CI-OFDM system. For CI-OFDM realization, digital implemented CI-OFDM structure is used in which CI code spreading operation and carrier allocation are separately processed by simple IFFT type operation. From the simulation results, it is shown that MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM reduces PAPR significantly compared with the conventional MIMO SFBC-OFDM system. The out-of band re-growth of signal spectrum in MIMO SFBC CI-OFDM system is much smaller than MIMO SFBC OFDM.

Converting the frequency into 10 MHz or baseband is the main function. It filters the spurious within channel bandwidth for downlink (DL) /uplink (UL). Also to support the communication with the other chips or peripherals, we design the interface modules and controller. As the UDCM is optimized on the Virtex5 families, it can save the dedicated FPGA resources and lowers the development costs. Its functionality is verified using simulation tools on the RTL (register transfer level) for the predefined test vector. After setting the timing constraints for the interface signals and timing verification, the UDCM downloaded into main unit.

MuCoJo can choose appropriate redundant copies of the tables to participate a joint query and optimizes the join order of it. By using the redundant copies, MuCoJo enlarges the search space so that the concurrent executions of different local sources can be best used. Meanwhile, MuCoJo could take advantage of redundancies features in such systems and get faster joint query response time. Experimental results show the computational efficiency of the MuCoJo and its necessity in information integration system. Moreover, during the population initialization, controlling invalid solutions can reduce the search space effectively at the cost of initialization time consuming.","doi":"10.1109/ICCGI.2008.20","startPage":"223","endPage":"228","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The Third International Multi-Conference on Computing in the Global Information Technology

The echogenicity of a region of interest comprising the intima-media layers, the lumen, and the adventitia in an ultrasonic \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>\n-mode image is modeled by a mixture of three Nakagami distributions. In a first step, we compute the maximum a posteriori estimator of the proposed model, using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. We then compute the optimal segmentation based on the estimated distributions as well as a statistical prior for disease-free IMT using a variant of the exploration/selection (ES) algorithm. Convergence of the ES algorithm to the optimal solution is assured asymptotically and is independent of the initial solution. In particular, our method is well suited to a semi-automatic context that requires minimal manual initialization. Tests of the proposed method on 30 sequences of ultrasonic \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">B</i>\n-mode images of presumably disease-free control subjects are reported.

The accurate identification of the fissures is of increasing importance in the early detection of pathologies, and in the regional functional analysis of the lungs. We have developed an automatic method for the segmentation and analysis of the fissures, based on the information provided by the segmentation and analysis of the airway and vascular trees. This information is used to provide a close initial approximation to the fissures, using a watershed transform on a distance map of the vasculature. In a further refinement step, this estimate is used to construct a region of interest (ROI) encompassing the fissures. The ROI is enhanced using a \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">ridgeness</i>\n measure, which is followed by a 3-D graph search to find the optimal surface within the ROI. We have also developed an automatic method to detect incomplete fissures, using a fast-marching based segmentation of a projection of the optimal surface. The detected incomplete fissure is used to extrapolate and smoothly complete the fissure. We evaluate the method by testing on data sets from normal subjects and subjects with mild to moderate emphysema.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2008.929101","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2008.929101","startPage":"202","endPage":"214","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/4771839/04591391.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4771839","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Anatomy-Guided Lung Lobe Segmentation in X-Ray CT Images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Anatomy-Guided Lung Lobe Segmentation in X-Ray CT Images","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"02 February 2009","volume":"28","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4591391/","accessionNumber":"10469654","pubMedId":"19188109","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591391/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Anatomy-Guided Lung Lobe Segmentation in X-Ray CT Images","sourcePdf":"27tmi00-ukil.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087445S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"4771839","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"95","xplore-issue":"4771839","articleId":"4591391","onlineDate":"08 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4591395,"authors":[{"name":"Pradip De","affiliation":["Sentilla Corporation, Redwood Shores, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/4757248/4591395/4591395-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Pradip De received the MS and PhD degrees from the University of Texas at Arlington in 2004 and 2008, respectively.

To understand the vulnerability of such protocols and design defense mechanisms against piggy-backed virus attacks, it is critical to investigate the propagation process of these protocols in terms of their speed and reachability. In this paper, we propose a general framework based on the principles of epidemic theory, for vulnerability analysis of current broadcast protocols in wireless sensor networks. In particular, we develop a common mathematical model for the propagation that incorporates important parameters derived from the communication patterns of the protocol under test. Based on this model, we analyze the propagation rate and the extent of spread of a malware over typical broadcast protocols proposed in the literature. The overall result is an approximate but convenient tool to characterize a broadcast protocol in terms of its vulnerability to malware propagation. We have also performed extensive simulations which have validated our model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Epidemic Theoretic Framework for Vulnerability Analysis of Broadcast Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2008.115","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/7755/4757248/04591395.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2008.115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4757248","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4591395","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591395/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","displayDocTitle":"An Epidemic Theoretic Framework for Vulnerability Analysis of Broadcast Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4591395/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2009","publicationDate":"March 2009","accessionNumber":"10401554","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Epidemic Theoretic Framework for Vulnerability Analysis of Broadcast Protocols in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"ttm2009030413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075371S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"4757248","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"61","xplore-issue":"4757248","articleId":"4591395","onlineDate":"08 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4591403,"authors":[{"name":"He-Ming Ren","affiliation":["College of Optoelectric Science and Engineering, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/15/4603115/4591403/4591403-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["He-Ming Ren was born in Hunan, China, in April 1979.

Comparison of the results with those obtained using the 3-D FDTD method and with experimental data found in the literature is used to test the validity of the examined method. The approach employed here generally provides sufficient accuracy while allowing significant reduction in computation time and storage requirements as compared to the 3-D FDTD method. From the analysis carried out in this paper, induced voltages appear to be strongly dependent on ground conductivity, somewhat influenced by return-stroke speed, and essentially independent of

Using Presearched Genetic Algorithms for a MIMO System","abstract":"This correspondence presents a new approach that utilizes evolutionary computation and proportional-integral differential (PID) control to a multi-input multioutput (MIMO) nonlinear system. This approach is demonstrated through a laboratory helicopter called the twin rotor MIMO system (TRMS). The goals of control are to stabilize the TRMS in significant cross-couplings, reach a desired position, and track a specified trajectory efficiently. The proposed control scheme includes four PID controllers with independent input. In order to reduce total error and control energy, all parameters of the controller are obtained by a real-value-type genetic algorithm (RGA) with a system performance index as the fitness function. The system performance index was applied to the integral of time multiplied by the square error criterion to build a suitable fitness function in the RGA. We also investigated a new method for the RGA to solve more than ten parameters in the control scheme. The initial search range of the RGA was obtained by a nonlinear control design (NCD) technique. The NCD provided a narrow initial search range for the RGA. This new method led chromosomes to converge to optimal solutions more quickly in a complicated hyperplane. Computer simulations show that the proposed control scheme conquers system nonlinearities and influence between two rotors successfully.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591419/","volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4591419/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10177451","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"PID Control Using Presearched Genetic Algorithms for a MIMO System","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PID Control Using Presearched Genetic Algorithms for a MIMO System","sourcePdf":"38tsmcc05-juang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.110366S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"4603093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"4603093","articleId":"4591419","onlineDate":"08 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4591431,"authors":[{"name":"Jashandeep Singh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, National Institute of Technology, Hamirpur, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/57/4591414/4591431/4591431-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jashandeep Singh was born in Ludhiana (Punjab), India.

When estimating the simultaneous switching noise (SSN) generation and evaluating PDN designs, PDN impedance calculation is an efficient criterion. In this paper, we introduce two new kinds of modeling approaches that are exceptionally suited to improving the accuracy of the PDN impedance estimation, especially for hierarchical PDN. First, we propose a modeling procedure to add an interlevel electromagnetic coupling effect between PDNs of different levels, based on the resonant cavity model and segmentation method. In order to effectively consider the interlevel electromagnetic coupling effect, we introduce a new concept of interlevel PDN, which is, for example, composed of a metal plate in the package-level PDN and a metal plate in the PCB-level PDN. Next, we present a modeling procedure to include the fringing field effect at the edge of small-size PDN structure, which causes a considerable shift of cavity resonance frequencies in the PDN impedance profile. In order to verify the proposed modeling approaches, we have fabricated a series of test vehicles by combining two package-level PDN designs with a PCB-level PDN design. Finally, we have successfully validated the proposed modeling approaches with a series of frequency-domain measurements in a frequency range up to 5 GHz.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591479","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Advanced Packaging","pdfPath":"/iel5/6040/4591479/04591486.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TADVP.2008.927837","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TADVP.2008.927837","startPage":"544","endPage":"557","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Measurement of Interlevel Electromagnetic Coupling and Fringing Effect in a Hierarchical Power Distribution Network Using Segmentation Method With Resonant Cavity Model","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591486/","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Measurement of Interlevel Electromagnetic Coupling and Fringing Effect in a Hierarchical Power Distribution Network Using Segmentation Method With Resonant Cavity Model","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4591486/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"31","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"10178360","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Measurement of Interlevel Electromagnetic Coupling and Fringing Effect in a Hierarchical Power Distribution Network Using Segmentation Method With Resonant Cavity Model","sourcePdf":"31tadvp03-kim.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.109047S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"6040","isNumber":"4591479","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6040","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4591479","articleId":"4591486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4591501,"authors":[{"name":"Seung Wook Yoon","affiliation":["Institute of Microelectronics, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6040/4591479/4591501/4591501-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Seung Wook Yoon received the Ph.D. degree in materials science and engineering from KAIST, Daejeon, Korea, in 1998.","He is Deputy Laboratory Director of Microsystem, Module and Components Laboratory, Institute of Microelectronics (IME), Singapore.

Nevertheless, some limitations arise for the operation of such systems, mainly regarding the fact that normally the panel output cannot be grounded, what is, for example not allowed in USA. Non- grounded operation of panels composed of some new cells technologies can bring undesired effects like cell aging and efficiency reduction. In addition, security matters regarding leakage current due to the panel parasitic capacitance are also a common problem in such systems. In order to address such matters, this paper proposes a novel DC-DC converter for the application in transformerless photovoltaic systems. As main characteristic, it allows the grounding of the negative output of the photovoltaic array and provides a bipolar output voltage. Following the proposition of the circuit, the analysis and evaluation will be performed. A prototype was built and the experimental results are presented in the end.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel grid-connected non-isolated converters for photovoltaic systems with grounded generator","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4591897","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04591897.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"65","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4591897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4591897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591897/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Novel grid-connected non-isolated converters for photovoltaic systems with grounded generator","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4591897/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154937","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Novel grid-connected non-isolated converters for photovoltaic systems with grounded generator","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p58-p65.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073048S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4591897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4591912,"authors":[{"name":"Mark Norris","affiliation":["Colorado Power Electronics Center, ECE Department, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Norris","id":"38196264300"},{"name":"Lazaro Marco Platon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Lazaro Marco","lastName":"Platon","id":"38094468900"},{"name":"Eduard Alarcon","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Eduard","lastName":"Alarcon","id":"37274243200"},{"name":"Dragan Maksimovic","affiliation":["Colorado Power Electronics Center, ECE Department, University of Colorado, Boulder, USA"],"firstName":"Dragan","lastName":"Maksimovic","id":"37276047600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4591912","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Noise","Converters","Frequency modulation","Frequency conversion","Quantization","Voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","PWM power convertors","sigma-delta modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantization noise shaping","digital PWM converters","sigma-delta modulators","higher order SigmaDelta modulators","switched-mode power converters","digital pulse-width modulation","DPWM nonlinearities","converter switching frequency","synchronous buck power converter","maximum noise spectral component","1st order modulator","3rd-order SigmaDelta modulator","high-frequency digital controllers","DC-DC converters","frequency 781 kHz"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses quantization noise shaping using sigma-delta (SigmaDelta) modulators in switched-mode power converters with digital pulse-width modulation (DPWM).

The MMC consists of cascade connection of multiple bidirectional PWM chopper-cells and floating dc capacitors per leg, thus requiring voltage-balancing control of their chopper-cells. However, no paper has been discussed explicitly on voltage-balancing control with theoretical and experimental verifications. This paper deals with two types of modular multilevel PWM converters with focus on their circuit configurations and voltage-balancing control. Combination of averaging and balancing controls enables the MMCs to achieve voltage balancing without any external circuit. The viability of the MMCs as well as the effectiveness of the PWM control method is confirmed by simulation and experiment.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4591917","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04591917.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4591917","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","startPage":"154","endPage":"161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PWM control and experiment of modular multilevel converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4591917","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PWM control and experiment of modular multilevel converters","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591917/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155002","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4591917/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PWM control and experiment of modular multilevel converters","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p154-p161.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066397S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"151","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4591917","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4591918,"authors":[{"name":"Haiwen Liu","affiliation":["University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN, USA"],"firstName":"Haiwen","lastName":"Liu","id":"37655836800"},{"name":"Leon M.

The PEBB is composed of 6 switches in a crossed configuration [8] and one capacitor. It is common to the 3 phases of a 5 level ANPC topology, enabling a large number of levels to be generated, especially uniform voltages steps in 7 and 9 levels configurations. This PEBB is meant to be a reliable upgrade to the 5L topology, increasing output signal quality, and therefore directly contributing in reducing the size of the output filter notably in medium voltage applications. The number of levels generated by the C S PEBB and the ANPC depend on the voltage ratios chosen between the phase capacitors of the ANPC and the PEBB capacitor(s). The trade off stands between ability to balance the capacitors, the rated blocking voltage of the devices and the number of levels produced. Under a given configuration, 9 levels can be produced with the possibility to balance the capacitors up to modulation indexes in the region of m=0.92. The analysis of the general topology, the description of the 9 level case, and simulation results are first presented. Prototyping results are then shown and validate the introduced concept and topology.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4591919","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04591919.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4591919","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","startPage":"167","endPage":"173","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Introducing the Common Cross Connected Stage (C<sup>3</sup>S) for the 5L ANPC multilevel inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4591919","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Introducing the Common Cross Connected Stage (C<sup>3</sup>S) for the 5L ANPC multilevel inverter","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591919/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155004","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4591919/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Introducing the Common Cross Connected Stage (C<sup>3</sup>S) for the 5L ANPC multilevel inverter","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p167-p173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055643S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4591919","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4591920,"authors":[{"name":"Silke Allebrod","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics and Control, Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Silke","lastName":"Allebrod","id":"38094470800"},{"name":"Roman Hamerski","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics and Control, Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Roman","lastName":"Hamerski","id":"38094476600"},{"name":"Rainer Marquardt","affiliation":["Institute of Power Electronics and Control, Universit\u00e4t der Bundeswehr Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Rainer","lastName":"Marquardt","id":"37272458400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4591920","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":550,"citationCountPatent":18,"totalDownloads":7347},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Equations","Switching loss","Power conversion","Passive filters","Voltage control","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","insulated gate bipolar transistors","power semiconductor devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["scalable modular multilevel converters","HVDC-transmission","high voltage direct current converter","IGBT-power devices","power supply","power distribution","passive filters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High-voltage","Voltage Source Converters (VSC)","High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission","semiconductor losses","converter efficiency"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4591920","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04591920.pdf","startPage":"174","endPage":"179","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4591920","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4591920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New transformerless, scalable Modular Multilevel Converters for HVDC-transmission","abstract":"In this paper a novel concept of high voltage direct current converter (HVDC) is presented employing the modular multilevel converter (M2C).

The structure of the given MCSR consists of three modules of current-source, three-phase six-valve converters and some sharing-current inductors.

Harmonic characteristics of the ac input current and the dc output voltage and current are analyzed in detail. It is shown that, many good features can be achieved such as equivalent higher carrier frequency at the ac side of the MCSR even with lower switching frequency.

Among various existent PWM principles natural sampled PWM (NPWM) is the best one in aspects of the harmonic distortion, attenuation, and time delay of the base-band modulating signals. So the best PWM implementing scheme would be a fully digital implemented scheme based on the natural sampled PWM principle. In this paper a universal digitized naturally sampled PWM (DNPWM) scheme was studied. The pulse width errors of DNPWM output compared with the NPWM output were theoretically analyzed in detail, which are caused by the finite sampling period TADC, the word length nADC in analog-digital conversion (ADC), and digital clock period T0 of the digital system. A set of equations of pulse width errors with respect to various system parameter were derived. The redundant pulses caused by the step effects of sampling and quantization in ADC and quantization in digital carrier, which is inevitable, were analyzed in detail too, and a method to eliminate the redundant pulses is presented. To Cancel redundant pulses would bring about additional pulse errors, which had also been analyzed. Finally, simulation research gave statistical results that demonstrate the validity of the analysis in this paper, and experimental results are given too.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pulse width modulation","Quantization","Mathematical model","Modulation","Data models","Analytical models","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clocks","digital circuits","harmonic distortion","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pulse width errors","digitized naturally sampled PWM","harmonic distortion","attenuation","base-band modulating signals","digital implemented scheme","finite sampling period","analog-digital conversion","digital clock period"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Pulsewidth Modulation","Digitization","Pulse Errors","Redundant Pulses"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4591994","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04591994.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"597","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4591994","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A study on pulse width errors of digitized naturally sampled PWM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4591994","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A study on pulse width errors of digitized naturally sampled PWM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4591994/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4591994/","accessionNumber":"10154957","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A study on pulse width errors of digitized naturally sampled PWM","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p592-p597.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05194S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4591994","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592000,"authors":[{"name":"W.

The switching frequency is maintained constant by using a frequency-to-voltage converter and comparing its output with a reference voltage to control the width of the hysteresis in the boundary controller. Compared with the methods using phase-locked loops, the proposed method has a wider lock-in range. Moreover, it integrates the advantages of the boundary control that the converter can settle into the steady state in two switching actions after large-signal input or output disturbances. The basic operating principles, stability analysis and design procedures will be given. The proposed control method has been successfully applied to control a 140 W, 24 V/12 V buck converter.

The goal is to optimize the network operation at a given port by fully exploiting the capability of the various compensation units. The background for cooperative operation lays on the conservation of instantaneous complex power, a quantity which envelopes power and energy information of electrical networks and keeps validity even in presence of non-sinusoidal voltage supply and distorting loads. Based on this principle, a control approach is developed which applies to static reactive compensators (SVC) as well as to active power filters (APF). In particular, the high-power capability of SVC is combined with the fast response of APF to achieve full compensation of reactive power and harmonic currents. Single-phase and three-phase simulations demonstrate the capability of the proposed compensation approach.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10154967","htmlLink":"/document/4592004/","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Synergistic control and cooperative operation of distributed harmonic and reactive compensators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synergistic control and cooperative operation of distributed harmonic and reactive compensators","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p654-p660.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064776S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4592038,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Thus, it is not applicable for high step-up applications. As a solution, combining a boost converter with a series output module can be considered to supplement the insufficient step-up ratio. By applying this concept, a new integrated boost-sepic (IBS) converter, which provides additional step-up ratio with the help of an isolated sepic converter, is proposed in this paper. Since the boost converter and the sepic converter share a boost inductor and a switch, its structure is simple. Moreover, the proposed IBS converter needs no current- snubber for the diodes, since the transformer leakage inductor alleviates the reverse recovery.

The multilevel modular capacitor clamped converter (MMCCC) has several key features that make it possible to generate AC outputs (10 kHz) from a DC-DC converter circuit. Using those high frequency AC outputs, the MMCCC circuit can incorporate single or multiple high frequency transformers to generate isolated AC outputs. These isolated outputs can be rectified and filtered to obtain unidirectional or bi-directional DC outputs. Using another MMCCC converter stage or an active full bridge block, the AC port can be made bi-directional to transfer power in both directions. By adopting the MMCCC topology to achieve isolated outputs, it is possible to simultaneously integrate multiple DC sources in an isolated and non-isolated manner. This paper will investigate the origin of the AC outputs in the MMCCC circuit, and present an analytical approach to estimating the isolated DC output voltage. Finally, experimental results will be presented for further verification of the concept.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592055","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592055.pdf","startPage":"967","endPage":"973","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592055","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Generating isolated outputs in a multilevel modular capacitor clamped dc-dc converter (MMCCC) for hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Generating isolated outputs in a multilevel modular capacitor clamped dc-dc converter (MMCCC) for hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4592055/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155227","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592055/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generating isolated outputs in a multilevel modular capacitor clamped dc-dc converter (MMCCC) for hybrid electric and fuel cell vehicles","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p967-p973.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05964S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592055","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4592062,"authors":[{"name":"Lars Risbo","affiliation":["Mixed-Signal AV Department, Texas Instruments Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Risbo","id":"37285166400"},{"name":"Mikkel C.

In the presented work, the modeling method is exemplified for the standard PWM and two different self-oscillating (a.k.a. sliding mode) control schemes. The proposed method is believed by the authors to be the first method that is able to handle these fundamentally different control schemes within a single modeling framework.

The converter is capable of increased power transfer due to its three-phase power configuration, and it reduces the rms current per phase, thus reducing conduction losses. Further, interleaved operation of three-phase boost converter reduces overall ripple current, which is imposed into fuel cells and realizes smaller sized filter components, increasing effective operating frequency and leading to higher power density. Each output current of three-phase boost converter is combined by the three-phase transformer and flows in the continuous conduction mode by the proposed three-phase PWM strategy. An efficiency of above 96% is mainly achieved by reducing conduction losses and switching losses are reduced by the action of active clamp branches, as well. The proposed converter and three-phase PWM strategy are analyzed, simulated and implemented in hardware.

A battery model capable of reproducing lithium-ion, nickel-metal hydride, and lead- acid I-V characteristics (with minimal model alterations) is proposed. A battery-testing apparatus was designed to measure the proposed parameters of the battery model for all three battery types and simulate driving schedules with a programmed source and load configuration. A multiple time-constant battery model was used for modeling lithium- ion batteries; verification of time constants in the seconds to minutes and hour ranges has been shown in numerous research articles and a time constant in the millisecond range is verified here with experiments. Lack of significant time constants in the millisecond range is validated through direct testing. A modeled capacity-rate effect within the state-of-charge determination portion of the proposed model is verified experimentally to ensure accurate prediction of battery state of charge after lengthy driving schedules. The battery model was programmed into a Matlab/Simulink environment and used as a power source for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle simulations. Results from simulations of lithium-ion battery packs show that the proposed battery model behaves well with the other subcomponents of the vehicle simulator; accuracy of the model and prediction of battery internal losses depends on the extent of tests performed on the battery used for the simulation. Extraction of model parameters and their dependence on temperature and cycle number is ongoing, as well as validation of the Simulink model with hardware- in-the-loop \"driving schedule\" cycling of real batteries.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Electrical battery model for use in dynamic electric vehicle simulations","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592119","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592119.pdf","startPage":"1336","endPage":"1342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592119","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592119","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592119/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Electrical battery model for use in dynamic electric vehicle simulations","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592119/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154977","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Electrical battery model for use in dynamic electric vehicle simulations","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p1336-p1342.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061353S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"174","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592119","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4592123,"authors":[{"name":"Amit Kumar Gupta","affiliation":["Vestas Technology R and D Singapore Private Limited, Singapore"],"firstName":"Amit Kumar","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37073191900"},{"name":"Ashwin M.

These harmonics lead to several undesired effects on grid connected applications. This necessitates the need for synchronous PWM. The close loop control of synchronous PWM is complex especially during dynamics. The PWM for multilevel inverter is fairly complicated as compared to two-level inverter. Hence, aforementioned problem is more severe when multilevel inverter is used as a voltage source inverter. To deal with these problems this paper proposes a scheme for the close loop flux control of a grid connected cascaded multilevel inverter. The scheme is based on synchronous space vector PWM. The usefulness of the proposed scheme is discussed, and demonstrated through analysis and experiments.

This solution allows ultra low- speed sensorless control without initial rotor-position estimation, and without machine parameters identification. A first-order lag compensator is employed to ensure a smooth transition from I-f to emf sensorless vector control when the frequency reaches a certain level, and back. The PMSM rotor position and speed are extracted by using a PLL state-observer from the estimated rotor-flux, which is based on an equivalent integrator in close- loop with a PI speed-adaptive compensator to eliminate dc-offset and phase-delay. Digital simulations for PMSM start-up with full load torque are presented for different initial rotor-positions. The transitions from I-f to emf motion-sensorless vector control and back as well, at very low-speeds, are fully validated by experimental results. This method is suitable for both surface and interior PMSMs, but the paper refers directly only to surface PMSM. Other field of application might be in wind generators safe (faster) self-starting when they are connected to the grid, or moving the rotor a little for inspections/repairs, and for general industrial variable speed drives where slightly hesitant but full- load self-starting is allowable.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592146","startPage":"1481","endPage":"1487","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592146.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592146","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"I-F starting method with smooth transition to EMF based motion-sensorless vector control of PM synchronous motor/generator","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Rotors","Cathode ray tubes","Stators","Torque","Current measurement","Machine vector control","Voltage measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","angular velocity control","closed loop systems","compensation","digital simulation","electric current control","machine vector control","motion control","observers","permanent magnet generators","permanent magnet motors","phase locked loops","PI control","robust control","starting","synchronous generators","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["I-F starting method","robust motion-sensorless vector control","PM synchronous motor/generator","emf-based vector control","current control","first-order lag compensator","smooth transition","PLL state-observer","close-loop control","PI speed-adaptive compensator","digital simulations","wind generator","industrial variable speed drives"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive estimator","Current control","PM Synchronous motors","Sensorless control","Variable speed drives"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592146/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"I-F starting method with smooth transition to EMF based motion-sensorless vector control of PM synchronous motor/generator","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592146/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155055","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"I-F starting method with smooth transition to EMF based motion-sensorless vector control of PM synchronous motor/generator","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p1481-p1487.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090539S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592147,"authors":[{"name":"A.

It integrates an electronic power circuit breaker consisting of two anti-serial cascodes, a control unit with current, voltage and temperature measurement as well as a power supply, making the switch fully self-sufficient. Each cascode is composed of a high-voltage SiC-JFET (junction field effect transistor) or a SiC-SIT (static induction transistor) and a low-voltage Si (silicon) - MOSFET (metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor), resulting in a normally-off configuration. This new circuit breaker has further advantages over well-known alternatives such as noiseless switches without electric arcs. Highest selectivity minimizes short-circuit currents and thus the stresses on electrical equipment. The integrated current and voltage measurement function allows the effective and apparent power to be determined. The switch can therefore actively influence inrush currents, resulting in better net exploitation. The benefits of using silicon carbide power semiconductors include a significant reduction of forward losses, which are the biggest drawback of electronic switches compared to mechanical ones, and the high ruggedness achieved by their intrinsic short-circuit capability for a period of time sufficient for the control unit to switch the devices off electronically. Its current and temperature measurement capability additionally assures overload protection by tracking the junction temperature within a digital model calculated by the control unit. Measurements at different operating points and in fault cases have been performed on prototypes of this novel semiconductor circuit breaker. The results show conclusively that this approach represents the next step forward to a perfect electronic circuit breaker.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592166/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155159","htmlLink":"/document/4592166/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Intelligent, compact and robust semiconductor circuit breaker based on silicon carbide devices","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intelligent, compact and robust semiconductor circuit breaker based on silicon carbide devices","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p1586-p1591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081424S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4592181,"authors":[{"name":"L.

They require a higher number of semiconductors and either multiple isolated dc sources or a bank of series connected capacitors. Consequently, the control complexity increases considerably, since more switching devices normally result in a higher number of possible combinations and the balance of the capacitors has to be guaranteed. But on the other hand, multilevel inverters create an extra degree of freedom due to existing redundant voltage vectors, which produce the same output phase voltage level but with diverse effect on the dc-link and floating capacitors. Among the existing control techniques the virtual-flux direct power control (VF-DPC) has showed to be very suitable for grid connected systems since it controls the active and reactive powers directly without any internal current control loop or PWM modulator. However, in order to adapt the VF-DPC for multilevel systems, specifically for the recently proposed five-level Active Neutral-Point Clamped converter, additional features must be included and/or modified in the inner main control loop. In order to allow the controller to select a higher number of available voltage vectors, the active and reactive power hysteresis strategies are modified. Additionally, a method to balance the dc-link and floating capacitor voltages by applying available redundant states is implemented, based on the actual condition of the voltage across the lower dc-link and floating capacitors, as well output phase currents direction. The proposed five-level VF-DPC has been implemented using a 6 kW five-level prototype and has shown good static and dynamic performance.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592181","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592181.pdf","startPage":"1668","endPage":"1674","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Five-level virtual-flux direct power control for the active neutral-point clamped multilevel inverter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592181","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592181/","displayDocTitle":"Five-level virtual-flux direct power control for the active neutral-point clamped multilevel inverter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155261","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592181/","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Five-level virtual-flux direct power control for the active neutral-point clamped multilevel inverter","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p1668-p1674.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055873S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4592183,"authors":[{"name":"Brendan Peter McGrath","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Monash University, Clayton, Australia"],"firstName":"Brendan Peter","lastName":"McGrath","id":"37295053300"},{"name":"Donald Grahame Holmes","affiliation":["ECSE Department, Monash University, Clayton, Australia"],"firstName":"Donald Grahame","lastName":"Holmes","id":"37280037000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592183","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"abstract":"This paper presents an analysis of the natural voltage balancing dynamics of a three phase flying capacitor converter when supplying an induction motor. The approach substitutes Double Fourier harmonic series for the PWM switching waveforms and the frequency response of the motor, to create a linear state space model of this type of load. The model requires the mid-frequency response (500 Hz - 20 kHz) of the induction motor impedance to be identified, and takes skin and proximity effects into account by adding parallel R-L networks to a standard motor model. Model parameters were measured by applying FFT analysis to variable frequency square waves injected into the motor terminals, and fitting parameter values to these measurements using a least squares minimisation method. From the analysis, it was found that the converter voltage balancing behavior degrades substantially at low motor speeds, and that a balance booster filter, as previously proposed, considerably improves the dynamic response. Experimental verification results using a scaled-down flying capacitor converter drive are included in the paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592183.pdf","startPage":"1681","endPage":"1687","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Natural capacitor voltage balancing for a flying capacitor converter induction motor drive","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Capacitors","Induction motors","Manganese","Converters","Switches","Harmonic analysis","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacitors","induction motor drives"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["natural capacitor voltage balancing","flying capacitor converter induction motor drive","three phase converter","PWM switching waveforms","frequency response","linear state space model","skin effects","proximity effects","parallel R-L networks","FFT analysis","balance booster filter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Natural capacitor voltage balancing for a flying capacitor converter induction motor drive","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592183/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155263","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Natural capacitor voltage balancing for a flying capacitor converter induction motor drive","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p1681-p1687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057355S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592183","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4592198,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mcgill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Li","id":"37537042800"},{"name":"Geza Joos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mcgill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Geza","lastName":"Joos","id":"37270090600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592198","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":79,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3840},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592198","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Batteries","Supercapacitors","System-on-a-chip","Energy storage","Hybrid power systems","Wind power generation","Discharges"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC power convertors","secondary cells","supercapacitors","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power electronic interface","wind farm","wind power surges","energy storage capacity","wind fluctuations","flow-battery supercapacitor","hybrid energy storage system","dc/dc IGBT converter interface","dc bus voltage","variable battery terminal voltage","high frequency power surges","battery power rating"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wind energy","wind turbine generator (WTG)","energy storage system (ESS)","battery energy storage system (BESS)","flow battery","supercapacitor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592198","endPage":"1768","startPage":"1762","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592198.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A power electronic interface for a battery supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system for wind applications","abstract":"An energy storage system (ESS) in a wind farm is required to be able to absorb wind power surges during gusts, and have sufficient energy storage capacity to level wind fluctuations lasting for longer periods. ESS using a single technology, such as batteries, or supercapacitors, will have difficulties providing both large power and energy capacities. This paper proposes a flow-battery supercapacitor hybrid ESS, which takes advantage of the two complementary technologies to provide large power and energy capacities. The flow-battery is directly coupled to the WTG dc bus while the supercapacitor has a dc/dc IGBT converter interface. The dc bus voltage varies within a certain limit determined by the variable battery terminal voltage. With the supercapacitor absorbing high frequency power surges, the battery power rating, degree of discharge, and power losses are all reduced. Therefore the battery in the hybrid ESS has low cost and high longevity; and the system overall efficiency is improved.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592198/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592198/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10155066","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A power electronic interface for a battery supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system for wind applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A power electronic interface for a battery supercapacitor hybrid energy storage system for wind applications","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p1762-p1768.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046699S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"79","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4592211,"authors":[{"name":"Heike Barth","affiliation":["Institute for Automation, Cologne University of Applied Sciences, Koln, Germany"],"firstName":"Heike","lastName":"Barth","id":"38094970600"},{"name":"Christoph Schaeper","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Schaeper","id":"38096590500"},{"name":"Tim Schmidla","affiliation":["Institute for Automation, Cologne University of Applied Sciences, Koln, Germany"],"firstName":"Tim","lastName":"Schmidla","id":"38096591100"},{"name":"Hannes Nordmann","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Hannes","lastName":"Nordmann","id":"38096590300"},{"name":"Martin Kiel","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Martin","lastName":"Kiel","id":"37865766900"},{"name":"Heinz van der Broeck","affiliation":["Institute for Automation, Cologne University of Applied Sciences, Koln, Germany"],"firstName":"Heinz","lastName":"van der Broeck","id":"37274794100"},{"name":"Yusuf Yurdagel","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Yusuf","lastName":"Yurdagel","id":"37088614749"},{"name":"Christoph Wieczorek","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Christoph","lastName":"Wieczorek","id":"37088614771"},{"name":"Frank Hecht","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Hecht","id":"37088614831"},{"name":"Dirk Uwe Sauer","affiliation":["Institute for Power Electronics and Electrical Drives (ISEA), RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk Uwe","lastName":"Sauer","id":"37532018300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592211","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":750},"abstract":"The number of small portable electronic devices (such as notebooks, mobile phones, etc.) has risen continuously over the last years.

In order to solve this problem the IEEE has organised the international student competition \"future energy challenge 2007\" aiming at the development of a highly efficient universal battery charger. This charger should be operated at all AC voltages between 90 V and 270 V and it should be able to optimal charge four different battery types (lead acid, NiCd, NiMH, Li-Ion) with an unknown number of cells. As a very challenging task the type and number of cells of the battery has to be determined by the terminal behaviour of the battery only.

Nevertheless, to obtain an enhanced operation of the device (full output light control), the luminous flux should be measured. This paper proposes a control method based on an estimator of the luminous flux emitted by the LED. Firstly, the LEDs are characterized. Based on these characterization, an estimator of the flux emitted by the LED is defined. The estimator provides this flux value from only two temperature values (the case temperature and the ambient temperature). The estimator is defined and validated in steady state as well as in the transient stage. The flux estimator is then validated with actual measurements. Once the estimator is defined and validated, the electronic driver to supply the LEDs as well as the digital control scheme are presented. Finally, a built prototype is presented, and the experimental results are shown. Conclusions of this work show that with the presented estimator, both the steady state and the transient luminous flux can be accurately estimated. Thus, the output light control of the LEDs can be accomplished by sensing temperature rather than luminous flux. The final output characteristic of the system shows linearity between the output flux and the reference value, with a DC operation of the LEDs.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Temperature measurement","Transient analysis","Steady-state","Temperature","Temperature control","Brightness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","LED displays","lighting control","photometry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["luminous flux","high brightness LED","case temperature","ambient temperature","flux estimator","electronic driver","digital control scheme"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592213","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592213.pdf","startPage":"1852","endPage":"1856","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592213","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An estimator of luminous flux for enhanced control of high brightness LEDs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An estimator of luminous flux for enhanced control of high brightness LEDs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592213/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592213/","accessionNumber":"10155168","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An estimator of luminous flux for enhanced control of high brightness LEDs","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p1852-p1856.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045649S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592222,"authors":[{"name":"Carlos Ferreira","affiliation":["Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico de Tomar, ESTT, DEE, Tomar, Portugal","Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Ferreira","id":"37397115800"},{"name":"Beatriz Borges","affiliation":["Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico, Lisboa, Portugal","Instituto de Telecommunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Lisboa, Portugal"],"firstName":"Beatriz","lastName":"Borges","id":"37274238800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592222","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power harmonic filters","Gain","Low pass filters","Impedance","Converters","Switches","Resonant frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-frequency amplifiers","low-pass filters","notch filters","power convertors","switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["notch low pass filter","switching audio amplification","switching frequency components","multilevel converters","voltage ripple"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592222","abstract":"In this paper a novel switched audio amplifier filter topology is proposed and its design criteria are presented.

In this paper, considering the influence of capacitors, the harmonics compensation and resonance damping characteristics of PAPF with traditional load current detection methods are analyzed. The analysis results show that, when capacitor current is not included in the detected load current, PAPF has ideal performance of load harmonics compensation and parallel resonance damping, but has no effect on damping series resonance and compensating harmonic current caused by supply voltage distortion; when capacitor current is included in the detected load current, PAPF with traditional control method can't work stable. To improve the system stability and the performance of PAPF, a novel control method of PAPF is proposed. With the proposed control method, PAPF has excellent performance for harmonics compensation and resonance damping.

The concept is based on simulating the behavior of ants in finding paths from the colony to food. Its searching mechanism is applicable for optimizing electric circuits with components, like resistors and capacitors, available in discrete values. In this paper, an extended ACO (eACO) that can search the optimal values of components manufactured in discrete and continuous values is presented. The idea is based on using the orthogonal design method (ODM) to dynamically update the database of the continuous components so that those components will have \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">pseudo</i>\n-discrete values in the search space. To speed up the optimization process, the ODM performs local search of the best combination around the best ant. The eACO also takes the component tolerances into account in evaluating the fitness value of each ant. The proposed algorithm has been successfully used to optimize the design of a buck regulator. The predicted results have been compared with the published results available in the literature and have also verified with experimental measurements.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592300/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10155304","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592300/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Optimization of power electronic circuits using ant colony system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimization of power electronic circuits using ant colony system","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p2396-p2402.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09309S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4592303,"authors":[{"name":"Joep Jacobs","affiliation":["Philips, Research, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Joep","lastName":"Jacobs","id":"37275925300"},{"name":"Shen Jie","affiliation":["Philips, Research, Aachen, Germany"],"lastName":"Shen Jie","id":"37087345889"},{"name":"Dirk Hente","affiliation":["Philips, Research, Aachen, Germany"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Hente","id":"37836845300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592303","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":378},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Organic light emitting diodes","Clocks","Switching frequency","Digital control","Control systems","Lighting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver circuits","electric current control","light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital current controller","solid-state lighting","light emitting diodes","organic LED","driver control IC"]}],"abstract":"During the last two decades, the performance of solid-state lighting devices, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and organic LEDs (OLEDs) has improved rapidly. Hence, LEDs and OLEDs become very attractive for many applications. (O)LEDs are preferably current driven, because the relationship between current and luminance is linear. Typically, the implemented control algorithms are analog. This paper proposes the use of a very simple though extremely stable digital control algorithm, which enables the replacement of expensive \"driver control\" ICs by simple and cheap comparator ICs. Hence, the costs of the system can be reduced. Additionally, the system shows very high efficiency as well as a very high dynamic performance. The digital control method is characterized by the following features: - The control strategy is extremely easy to implement. - The control strategy eliminates the need for (expensive) converter control ICs. - System costs are reduced. - The control strategy is extremely robust, i.e. the control is stable. - The control offers a high dynamic response. - The switching frequency is not constant, but its maximum value is limited. - In most points of operation, subharmonic currents are generated by the controller, which may result in flicker effects. Nevertheless, if designed correctly, the sub harmonics can be avoided. - The control method is extremely suitable for buck converters, but can also be applied to other topologies.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592303","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592303.pdf","startPage":"2417","endPage":"2422","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592303","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592303","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple digital current controller for solid-state lighting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A simple digital current controller for solid-state lighting","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592303/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592303/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155306","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple digital current controller for solid-state lighting","confLoc":"Rhodes","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p2417-p2422.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04018S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592303","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4592304,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Among them, low voltage ride-through requirements demand wind power plant to remain connected to the network in presence of grid voltage dips, contributing to keep network voltage and frequency stable. Wind power technology points to increase voltage levels. Hence, multilevel converters are well suited for this application. The use of symmetrical components to control grid-connected voltage-source converters is simple and effective, but a sequence separation method is needed, which delivers inexact response during a lapse of time after a fault appearance or clearance. This inaccurate response can be a significant drawback. Predictive current control presents similar dynamic response and reference tracking than other well established control methods, but working at lower switching frequencies. In this work, predictive current control is applied to the grid-side NPC converter, in order to fulfil LVRT requirements. Then, a sequence separation method is not needed and inaccuracies after grid fault appearance and clearance are removed from the system performance. DC-link neutral point balance is also achieved by means of the predictive control algorithm, which considers the redundant switching states of the NPC. Simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed control approach.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592304","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592304.pdf","startPage":"2423","endPage":"2428","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592304","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Predictive current control of grid-connected neutral-point-clamped converters to meet low voltage ride-through requirements","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Predictive current control of grid-connected neutral-point-clamped converters to meet low voltage ride-through requirements","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4592304/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155307","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592304/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Predictive current control of grid-connected neutral-point-clamped converters to meet low voltage ride-through requirements","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p2423-p2428.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069321S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592304","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592318,"authors":[{"name":"Tahara Suguru","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Tahara","lastName":"Suguru","id":"38096549700"},{"name":"Tabuchi Fumitoshi","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki University, Saitama, Japan"],"lastName":"Tabuchi Fumitoshi","id":"37088196147"},{"name":"Yokoyama Tomoki","affiliation":["Tokyo Denki University, Saitama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yokoyama","lastName":"Tomoki","id":"38096550500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592318","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592318","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Steady-state","Capacitors","Pulse width modulation","Rectifiers","Inverters","Timing","Frequency control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital control","field programmable gate arrays","microcontrollers","PWM invertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable sampling quasi multirate deadbeat control","single phase PWM inverter","real time digital feedback control","variable sampling method","FPGA based hardware controller","transient response","switching devices","digital control method","frequency 1 MHz"]}],"abstract":"A new approach for real time digital feedback control of PWM inverter is proposed, in which a quasi multi-rate deadbeat control com-bined with variable sampling method using FPGA based hardware controller.

Firstly, a general model for vibration-driven harvesters is described. Using this model, an optimal linear resistive load for the harvester can be analytically calculated. As the vibration-based harvester provides varying AC power, while electronic loads need a stable DC power supply, it is useful to analyze the harvester behavior when connected to a non-linear AC-DC rectifier. Using the same general model, an optimal DC voltage load can be calculated for every frequency. The difference between the optimal output power flow from the harvester to both load circuits depends on the coupling coefficient of the harvester device. To validate previous conclusions, two power processing circuits are designed and built, the first emulating a resistive input impedance and the second with a constant input voltage. A piezo-electric bimorph is taken as energy harvesting device. A buck-boost DC-DC converter without input filter capacitor, operating in discontinuous conduction mode, is shown to have a resistive input impedance. A buck converter with input filter capacitor is used to evaluate the rectifier load-case. Simulations and experimental validation show that the efficiency of the overall system, harvester device with power processing circuit, increases if the power processing circuit has a fixed DC-voltage as input.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592325.pdf","startPage":"2556","endPage":"2562","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592325","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592325","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power processing circuits for vibration-based energy harvesters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power generation","Converters","Couplings","Integrated circuit modeling","Rectifiers","Switches","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","DC-DC power convertors","load flow","piezoelectric devices","rectifying circuits","vibrations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power processing circuit","piezoelectric vibration-based energy harvester","optimal linear resistive load","nonlinear AC-DC rectifier","power flow","coupling coefficient","buck-boost DC-DC converter","stable DC power supply","filter capacitor"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592325/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Power processing circuits for vibration-based energy harvesters","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592325/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10155328","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power processing circuits for vibration-based energy harvesters","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-P2556-P2562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060343S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592325","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4592337,"authors":[{"name":"Bingsen Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"lastName":"Bingsen Wang","id":"37087069468"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592337","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":543},"abstract":"This paper presents a new topology of four-level neutral point clamped (NPC) converter that is primarily targeted for high-power applications.

However, only a few papers deal with the analysis of faults and the development of adequate remedial strategies. This is one of the most important aspects that must be carefully considered and investigated when transferring converter systems from research laboratories to the applications. Failures of the components in static energy conversion systems must be adequately faced to prevent severe and widespread damages in the converter, or even extended to the load and the grid. In particular, in multilevel converters, system protection is more difficult when compared to simpler two-levels converters, mainly because current fault paths can be much more complex. Problems may be exalted in high power applications, as those considered in this paper, when several kVs and hundreds of kAs characterize the application. In this paper, a study and an analysis of important fault scenarios in a high power (up to 12 MVAs) IGCT based Neutral Point Clamped converter system are presented and possible remedial strategies are discussed. Although the study has been performed mainly by simulation, some interesting experimental results, obtained in the joint laboratory between Ansaldo Sistemi Industriali and the University of Genova, are also presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592366/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4592366/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154604","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Faults analysis and remedial strategies in high power neutral point clamped converters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Faults analysis and remedial strategies in high power neutral point clamped converters","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p2778-p2783.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04143S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4592393,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Two different symmetrical and asymmetrical arrangements of a four-level diode clamped inverters have been compared, in order to find an optimum arrangement with lower switching losses and optimised output voltage quality. The optimised asymmetrical arrangement has been compared with a conventional four- level inverter. The comparison results show that an asymmetrical configuration can obtain more voltage levels in output voltage with same number of component compared with the conventional four-level inverter and this will lead to the reduction of harmonic content of output voltage. A predictive current control technique has been carried out to verify the viability of new configuration. The advantages of this control method are simplicity and applicability for n-level multilevel inverters, without a significant change in the control circuit.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592393","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592393.pdf","startPage":"2921","endPage":"2926","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison between symmetrical and asymmetrical single phase multilevel inverter with diode-clamped topology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Comparison between symmetrical and asymmetrical single phase multilevel inverter with diode-clamped topology","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4592393/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154626","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592393/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison between symmetrical and asymmetrical single phase multilevel inverter with diode-clamped topology","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p2921-p2926.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059036S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592393","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592415,"authors":[{"name":"Majd G.

This system contains a processor and a high bandwidth current regulator as a peripheral, and all of these are implemented on a single-chip FPGA. The execution time of the current regulator is less than 200 ns at 100 MHz clock frequency. Thanks to this fast execution, the inevitable digital delay, which is 1.5 times the sampling period in a PWM inverter has been reduced to a half of the sampling period. As the result, the control bandwidth of the current regulator has been extended up to about 3 kHz at 10 kHz PWM switching frequency. By exploiting the performance of the current regulator, the speed regulation bandwidth also enhanced up to 700 Hz. The experimental results are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed system and the performance of the regulator.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592416","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592416.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592416","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","startPage":"3043","endPage":"3047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based motion controller with a high bandwidth current regulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592416","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based motion controller with a high bandwidth current regulator","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592416/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154696","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4592416/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based motion controller with a high bandwidth current regulator","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p3043-p3047.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055571S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592416","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4592417,"authors":[{"name":"Uffe Jakobsen","affiliation":["Institute of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Uffe","lastName":"Jakobsen","id":"37392168800"},{"name":"Torben Matzen","affiliation":["Institute of Energy Technology, University of Aalborg, Aalborg, Denmark"],"firstName":"Torben","lastName":"Matzen","id":"37394182700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592417","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"abstract":"Motor control for small series sometimes requires specialized control logic, requiring rewiring if new logic needs to be added. This paper describes a different approach to hardware and software co-design, namely designing a softcore processor with an instruction set to fit the purpose of control of drives. Furthermore the softcore processor is designed with a system for plug in of external logic. Doing so shortens development time, since functionality is simply added to or removed from the softcore. The designer can then choose between resource usage on the FPGA and execution speed in more degrees. The approach is tested for two different motor types, synchronous and hybrid switched reluctance motors, using a Spartan 3E FPGA. The impact of having ADC-communication in VHDL versus in assembler is also presented.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592417.pdf","startPage":"3048","endPage":"3053","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of a dedicated processor for AC motor control implemented in a low cost FPGA","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Pulse width modulation","Motor drives","Process control","Hardware","Current measurement","Rotors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware-software codesign","instruction sets","machine control","microprocessor chips","reluctance motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC motor control","low cost FPGA","field programmable gate array","specialized control logic","hardware-software co-design","softcore processor","instruction set","external logic","resource usage","execution speed","motor types","synchronous motors","hybrid switched reluctance motors","Spartan 3E FPGA","ADC-communication","VHDL"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of a dedicated processor for AC motor control implemented in a low cost FPGA","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592417/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154697","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of a dedicated processor for AC motor control implemented in a low cost FPGA","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p3048-p3053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059995S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4592418,"authors":[{"name":"A. de Castro","affiliation":["Digital Systems Laboratory, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain"],"firstName":"A.","lastName":"de Castro","id":"37270919200"},{"name":"E.

The wireless battery charging platform must allow the load to be placed anywhere on the charging surface. Therefore the relative position between the movable energy-receiving coil and the energy-transmitting coils on the charging platform must be flexible. In this paper, an extended formula is proposed for the mutual inductance calculation for two coaxial or non-coaxial planar spiral windings sandwiched between two double-layer substrates. It can quickly determine the mutual coupling of two planar windings that can have different relative positions and distance between them. This new calculation method provides a new and useful tool for determining the mutual inductance of a movable planar coil and the fixed planar coil on the wireless battery charging platform. The theory has been favorably tested and compared with practical measurements and also finite-element analysis.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","startPage":"3475","endPage":"3481","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592493.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual inductance calculation of movable planar coils on parallel surfaces","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592493/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4592493/","displayDocTitle":"Mutual inductance calculation of movable planar coils on parallel surfaces","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154715","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual inductance calculation of movable planar coils on parallel surfaces","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p3475-p3481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058407S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592493","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4592495,"authors":[{"name":"Grant A.

Each load requires a power pick-up and regulator that is coupled to a track, which carries a resonant current at VLF frequencies (typically 10-50 kHz). Modern pick-ups are tuned for resonance at the track frequency and their power delivery increasingly depends on accurate tuning of the resonant circuit. In this paper a new self tuning power regulator for inductive power transfer systems is proposed and a control strategy described. The system uses a binary weighted series of capacitors that can be switched via simple relays across a parallel resonant pick-up circuit. There are no additional switching losses during tuning, detection and operation so that the technique is applicable to high power pick-ups. The tuning circuit is evaluated under simulation and then made to operate on a practical 500 W pick-up regulator used in materials handling applications. In both simulation and experiment it is shown to successfully detect the tuning state of the system and correct for it during operation.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592495","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592495.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592495","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","startPage":"3489","endPage":"3494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Self tuning pick-ups for inductive power transfer","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592495/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10154717","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592495/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self tuning pick-ups for inductive power transfer","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p3489-p3494.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046606S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592495","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4592498,"authors":[{"name":"Kwang-Chan Lee","affiliation":["EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kwang-Chan Lee","id":"37087743391"},{"name":"Chang-Seok Chae","affiliation":["EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Chang-Seok Chae","id":"37087426698"},{"name":"Kang-Ho Lee","affiliation":["EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Kang-Ho Lee","id":"37087333058"},{"name":"Gyu-Hyeong Cho","affiliation":["EECS, KAIST, Daejeon, South Korea"],"lastName":"Gyu-Hyeong Cho","id":"37087156886"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592498","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":851},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power capacitors","Switches","Generators","Logic gates","Driver circuits","Chromium","Topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["audio-frequency amplifiers","CMOS integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast switching charge dump","Class-D audio amplifier","Class-K audio amplifier","charge dump amplifier","CMOS process","power output","size 0.35 mum","frequency 1 kHz","efficiency 81 percent","power 257 mW","resistance 4.1 ohm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592498","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592498","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592498","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592498.pdf","startPage":"3506","endPage":"3511","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast switching charge dump assisted Class-D audio amplifier with high fidelity and high efficiency","abstract":"A fast switching charge dump assisted Class-D audio amplifier is presented in this paper.

Using the voltage-oriented PI current control with converter current feedback, additional active damping of the filter resonance is necessary for stable operation. In the literature different methods are proposed that differ in number of sensors and complexity of control algorithms. If higher damping of the switching ripple current is required LCL-filters with lower resonance frequencies can be used. Resulting low ratios between resonance frequency and control frequency challenge the control with respect to damping of resonance. Moreover, some active damping methods are not suitable for these filter settings. Here the active damping concept based on virtual resistor is analyzed concerning stability for two significant filter configurations. It turns out that it is applicable for configurations with higher resonance frequency, whereas systems lower resonance frequencies can poorly be damped. Additionally the method exhibits the advantage of simple implementation but the disadvantage of additional current sensors. Theoretical analyses and of the selected method with time-discrete implementation are shown in this paper. Theory is verified by experimental results.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592502/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592502/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154773","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Active damping of LCL-filter resonance based on virtual resistor for PWM rectifiers \u2014 stability analysis with different filter parameters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Active damping of LCL-filter resonance based on virtual resistor for PWM rectifiers \u2014 stability analysis with different filter parameters","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p3532-p3538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055363S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"80","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592507,"authors":[{"name":"Jason T.

We describe the motivation for using pulse-density modulation (PDM) to achieve linear amplitude modulation of a nominally nonlinear switching power amplifier. The amplifier achieves linearity suitable for wideband wireless standards, with peak efficiency of 43.5% at 1.95 GHz and up to 20 dBm output power.

It is shown that a pulse-width modulation (PWM) discontinuity around buck/boost mode transition can result in substantial increases in output voltage ripple. The effect of the PWM nonlinearity is studied using periodic steady state analysis to quantify the worst case ripple voltage in terms of design parameters. Furthermore, a bifurcation analysis shows that the PWM discontinuity leads to quasi- periodic route to chaos, which results in erratic operation around the buck/boost mode transition. The increased ripple is a very significant problem when the converter is used as a power supply for an RF power amplifier, as is the case in WCDMA handsets. An approach is proposed to remove the discontinuity which results in reduced output voltage ripple, at the expense of reduced efficiency, as demonstrated on an experimental prototype.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592538","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592538.pdf","startPage":"3741","endPage":"3747","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592538","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of PWM nonlinearity in non-inverting buck-boost power converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592538","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592538/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of PWM nonlinearity in non-inverting buck-boost power converters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154652","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592538/","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of PWM nonlinearity in non-inverting buck-boost power converters","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p3741-p3747.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041782S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592538","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4592548,"authors":[{"name":"Grant E.

Load change produces voltage over- and undershoots and a design-point shift. In most cases, the controller is blind to these shifts. However, load knowledge is an essential design parameter and should precede optimal and adaptive control techniques. System identification algorithms implemented on digital processors open new opportunities in control and system performance. Typical studies in SMPS identification are based on offline steady-state measurements that form nonparametric frequency-domain models. This paper investigates real-time system identification algorithms that generate parametric models - a practical form for pole-placement and root-locus design. Two key metrics are introduced: parameter error and convergence time to describe algorithm accuracy and speed, respectively, after abrupt parameter changes - a common SMPS load scenario. Hardware and simulation results will show that an algorithm called recursive least squares, in its most basic form, could reasonable approximate the input-to-inductor current plant for static loads during startup, but not for abrupt load steps.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592548","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592548.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592548","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","startPage":"3807","endPage":"3813","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-time system identification for load monitoring and transient handling of Dc-Dc supplies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592548","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Real-time system identification for load monitoring and transient handling of Dc-Dc supplies","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592548/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592548/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154662","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-time system identification for load monitoring and transient handling of Dc-Dc supplies","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p3807-p3813.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054086S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592548","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4592552,"authors":[{"name":"Biranchinath Sahu","affiliation":["Texas Instruments (India) Private Limited, Bangalore, India"],"firstName":"Biranchinath","lastName":"Sahu","id":"37296845100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592552","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1025},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and design of a fully-integrated current sharing scheme for multi-phase adaptive on -time modulated switching regulators","abstract":"Multi-phase, interleaved dc-dc converters employing current mode control with adaptive on-time modulation are ideally suited for low-voltage, high current processor power supply applications because of their fast load transient response and minimal external components having simple feedback loop compensation, while maintaining almost constant switching frequency. Like other multi-phase converters, to achieve optimal thermal performance and utilize all the benefits of interleaving, accurate current balancing among all the phases is necessary and paramount. This paper introduces a novel current-sharing scheme for multi-phase, current-mode, adaptive on-time modulated, switching dc-dc converters where the on-time for each phase is adjusted based current sharing error between phase currents. Careful analysis of the share-loop transfer function reveals that a low gain but high bandwidth feedback loop can be designed to achieve accurate and fast current sharing without interfering with voltage and/or current loop of the power supply. As a result, the proposed scheme provides a low cost solution because it does not require any external phase compensation element and additional pin in the controller IC. Experimental results from two-phase prototype step-down converter utilizing the proposed current-sharing scheme with input voltage range of 7-28 V and output voltage of 0.3 -1.5 V with a maximum load current of 44 A are presented in this paper. During steady-state operation, current sharing error between two phases is less than 5% for half-to-full load current. Furthermore, accurate current balancing is maintained during transient events, such as phase add or drop, and load-step insertion or release.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592552","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","startPage":"3829","endPage":"3835","displayPublicationTitle":"2008

The proposed design is particularly well-suited for an integrated CMOS process, as it makes use of the available on-die device characteristics. In such a process, the two-stage architecture presented offers high efficiency, high power density, and high- bandwidth regulation. We show that by merging the switched-capacitor stage and the regulation stage in a specific manner, further performance improvements can be attained. When the fast-switching regulation stage is used to provide soft charging of the switched-capacitor stage, a substantial improvement in performance is possible. An experimental prototype, implemented using discrete components, validates the approach.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592581","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592581.pdf","startPage":"4008","endPage":"4015","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592581","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Merged two-stage power converterarchitecture with softcharging switched-capacitor energy transfer","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592581/","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154794","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592581/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Merged two-stage power converterarchitecture with softcharging switched-capacitor energy transfer","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4008-p4015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081621S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"58","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592581","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-15"},{"_id":4592584,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Yilmaz","affiliation":["Grainger Center for Electric Machinery and Electromechanics, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Murat","lastName":"Yilmaz","id":"38506031100"},{"name":"Philip T.

The most common known models are based on equivalent circuits and related analytical models, or on FEA. Analytical models use highly simplified magnetics, and have difficulty extending into saturation. FEA typically uses magnetic vector potential representations that model additional effects such as eddy currents, but requires detailed nonlinear models for saturation and hysteresis. MEC methods represent a third possibility for electrical machine analysis, based on permeance network models comprising reluctances and mmf sources. Advantages of the MEC method include reduced model complexity compared to FEA, enhanced accuracy compared to analytical approaches, ease of parameterization, methods for extension to 3-D capability, and fast computation time. One of the most significant concerns related to literature in this area is that very few papers report thorough comparisons between experimental measurements and simulation tools for electromechanical devices. Among those that do, even fewer compare electromechanical forces and torques. With less than 15 exceptions, the few papers providing such comparisons report ldquogood agreement, rdquo but in fact show errors of 10% or more between tests and simulations. Many papers with experimental results do not compare torque or force results or present error analysis. This is most unfortunate, as many authors deen to consider FEA results ldquodefinitiverdquo and use them as a basis for model comparisons. Saturation and iron losses appear to be the likely culprits. In a few papers, the reported analysis method takes full nonlinear magnetic effects into account. When magnetic saturation, eddy currents, hysteresis losses, and similar effects are modeled with care and in detail, differences between simulations and experiments typically are on the order of 5%.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592584","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592584.pdf","startPage":"4027","endPage":"4033","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capabilities of finite element analysis and magnetic equivalent circuits for electrical machine analysis and design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592584/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capabilities of finite element analysis and magnetic equivalent circuits for electrical machine analysis and design","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4592584/","accessionNumber":"10154797","publicationDate":"June 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capabilities of finite element analysis and magnetic equivalent circuits for electrical machine analysis and design","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4027-p4033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.170363S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4592585,"authors":[{"name":"M.

In order to avoid inaccuracies introduced by simplification or assumptions, the analysis is entirely performed using a versatile geometrical method in the normalized domain. Both the output voltage and the capacitor current are considered as varying references to establish a more accurate control law with enhanced performance. The proposed normalization technique provides remarkable insight into the behavior of system leading to a pure geometrical treatment that is general and applicable to any possible inverter. As a result, a control law for inverters defined as natural SS is proposed and thoroughly characterized. In addition to the enhanced dynamic response, fixed frequency operation is one of the key features of the proposed control scheme. In order to formally demonstrate fixed frequency operation, a transformation from the natural SS to its PWM equivalent is performed, revealing duality between boundary control using curved SS and traditional PWM. This is a significant advancement towards the unification and understanding of traditional modulation against modulation produced by curved SSs. Finally, an additional novel concept is explored: operation in mixed monopolar and bipolar mode using the natural SS. This new mixed operating mode overcomes physical limitations of the inverter structure in monopolar mode around the region of output voltage zero crossing (both the problem identification and solution are investigated). Experimental results of a 1.5 kVA inverter operating at fixed moderate frequency are presented to validate the natural SS performance, illustrate the benefits of the normalization technique, and demonstrate the monopolar and mixed operating mode.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Advanced boundary control of inverters using the natural switching surface: Normalized geometrical derivation","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592585","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592585.pdf","startPage":"4034","endPage":"4043","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Advanced boundary control of inverters using the natural switching surface: Normalized geometrical derivation","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592585/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154798","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Advanced boundary control of inverters using the natural switching surface: Normalized geometrical derivation","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4034-p4043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059812S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4592586,"authors":[{"name":"Hozefa Mukadam","affiliation":["Thayer School of Engineering, Hanover, NH, USA"],"firstName":"Hozefa","lastName":"Mukadam","id":"38096561100"},{"name":"Charles R.

For the PFC stage, how to reduce the boost inductor and the EMI filter size without compromising the efficiency is the key to meet the challenges. Lots of techniques has been studied and proposed during the last several years. Among these techniques, multi-channel interleaving is a quite promising one. By staggering the channels at uniform intervals, multichannel interleaved PFC can reduce the EMI filter size significantly due to the ripple cancellation effect. In addition, the interleaving multi-channel configuration makes it possible to implement the phase-shedding to improve the PFC light load efficiency. Today, the power supply industry is spending tremendous effort on improving the PFC light efficiency due to the economic reasons and environmental concerns. By decreasing the number of active channels according to the load, the PFC light load efficiency can be optimized. In this paper, the phase-shedding control is proposed to improve the PFC light load efficiency and the issues on the EMI filter design are investigated. To improve the light load efficiency without compromising the EMI filter size, the asymmetrical phase angle control strategy is proposed, and is verified and demonstrated by the experimental results.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","startPage":"4080","endPage":"4085","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592592.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592592","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Light load efficiency improvement for multi-channel PFC","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic interference","Noise","Power harmonic filters","Switching frequency","Harmonic analysis","Delta modulation","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AC-DC power convertors","power factor correction","power filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["light load efficiency improvement","multichannel PFC","AC-DC front-end power supply design","boost inductor","EMI filter size","ripple cancellation effect","power supply industry","environmental concerns","phase-shedding control","light load efficiency","asymmetrical phase angle control strategy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Light load efficiency improvement for multi-channel PFC","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592592/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592592/","accessionNumber":"10154897","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Light load efficiency improvement for multi-channel PFC","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4080-p4085.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042987S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4592602,"authors":[{"name":"Fred C.

The approach is demonstrated by presenting two case study designs and measurements on converter prototypes. The goals of high efficiency and high power density are reached by an optimal converter design including soft switched SAZZ topology, paralleled mosfets, integrated inductors, interleaved converter modules, advanced thermal management and optimized spatial design. The initial goals of the project were to reach as high efficiency as possible and to exceed power density of 10 kW/litre. The power density goal was exceeded by a large margin reaching the power density of 17.7 kW/litre even for air-cooled system. The measured efficiency of a single converter module operating at 200 kHz is as high as 95.4% and a larger efficiency is still expected from the complete interleaved converter prototype.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","startPage":"4142","endPage":"4148","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592604.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592604","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pursuing high power-density and high efficiency in DC-DC converters for automotive application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Switches","Inductors","Topology","Thermal management","Heating","Light emitting diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automobiles","DC-DC power convertors","design engineering","snubbers","switching convertors","zero current switching","zero voltage switching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DC-DC converters","automotive converters","soft switched SAZZ topology","paralleled MOSFET","integrated inductors","interleaved converter modules","advanced thermal management","air-cooled system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Pursuing high power-density and high efficiency in DC-DC converters for automotive application","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592604/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592604/","accessionNumber":"10154907","publicationDate":"June 2008","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pursuing high power-density and high efficiency in DC-DC converters for automotive application","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4142-p4148.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046569S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4592609,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid A.

The proposed configuration uses two bi-directional switches per leg of the converter resulting in 12 bi-directional switches for a three-phase to three-phase topology. Power transfer from input to output is accomplished via a link inductor which is first charged from the input phases, then discharged to the output phases with a precisely controllable current PWM technique. Capacitance in parallel with the link inductor produces low turn-off losses. Turn-on is always at zero voltage as each switch swings from reverse to forward bias. Reverse recovery is with low di/dt and also is buffered due to the link capacitance. The soft switching nature of the converter permits use of slower switches with high link frequencies. Converter operation is bi-directional and supports any input or output power factor or voltage, within the current and voltage capacity of the switches. Simulation results showing converter operation under different conditions are presented along with loss calculations. The topology is expected to offer relatively low weight, compact and efficient power converters and motor drives.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592609","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592609.pdf","startPage":"4168","endPage":"4176","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592609","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft switched ac-link AC/AC and AC/DC buck-boost converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592609","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592609/","displayDocTitle":"Soft switched ac-link AC/AC and AC/DC buck-boost converter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154911","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592609/","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft switched ac-link AC/AC and AC/DC buck-boost converter","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4168-p4176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083373S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592609","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4592615,"authors":[{"name":"Chia-Lin Chiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chia-Lin Chiu","id":"37088041706"},{"name":"Ke-Horng Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Control Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ke-Horng Chen","id":"37087173173"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592615","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":33,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1394},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592615","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Light emitting diodes","Pulse width modulation","Detectors","Brightness","Digital multimedia broadcasting","Voltage control","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["driver circuits","electric current control","light emitting devices","lighting control","operational amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["current-balanced control","LED backlight","light emitting diodes","current regulation","current matching","constant driving current","operational amplifiers","LED strings","driving circuit","forward voltage variation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Current Balance","PWM Dimming","Open-Loop Detection"]}],"abstract":"this paper proposes a new circuit to regulate current in parallel LED (Light Emitting Diodes) strings.

At transistor-level, a self-driving scheme is proposed which allows supplying the tapered buffer drivers from the floating capacitor, thereby reducing the voltage across the power MOSFETs gate dielectric and improving efficiency. The presented converter exhibits enhanced degrees of freedom in the design space defined by the switching frequency, inductor and capacitors values, which have an impact on the achievable efficiency, occupied silicon area and output ripple.

In Voltage Source Converter (VSC) IGCT applications a series di/dt limiting inductor and a clamp circuit must be used, in order to protect freewheel diodes from excessive current derivatives. The main parameter to be considered in the clamping circuit design is the characteristics of the DC bus current, which may depend both on the converter topology and the chosen modulation strategy. In this paper a current di/dt limiter circuit for a H-Bridge with Bipolar and Unipolar modulation is designed and experimentally validated. It is shown that if the same clamp parameters are used for both modulations strategies, the semiconductor current di/dt in the Bipolar case is 50% smaller than in the Unipolar one. In addition, the turn-on overcurrent and the turn off overvoltage with the Bipolar modulation are twice with respect to the Unipolar ones. Thus, if the aim is to obtain the same overvoltage in both cases, the maximum output current for the Bipolar case will have to be 50% smaller.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clamps","Switches","Inductors","Modulation","Converters","Voltage control","Transient analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bridge circuits","modulation","power inductors","power semiconductor diodes","thyristor convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["insulated gate commutated thyristor","IGCT current clamp design","single phase H-bridge converter","voltage source converter","VSC","limiter inductor circuit","freewheel diode protection","DC bus current","bipolar-unipolar modulation strategy"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592643","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592643.pdf","startPage":"4343","endPage":"4348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of IGCT current clamp design for single phase H-bridge converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592643","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of IGCT current clamp design for single phase H-bridge converters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592643/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592643/","accessionNumber":"10154814","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of IGCT current clamp design for single phase H-bridge converters","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4343-p4348.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047937S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592643","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592644,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Havanur","affiliation":["Principal Applications Engineer, Alpha and Omega semiconductor, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Havanur","id":"38096703200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592644","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":852},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logic gates","Inductance","MOSFETs","Clamps","Avalanche breakdown","Current measurement","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["avalanche breakdown","invertors","motor drives","power MOSFET","switching circuits","Zener diodes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quasi-clamped inductive switching behaviour","power MOSFETS","voltage spikes","avalanche breakdown","motor drives","inverters","gate drive parameters","peak voltage","gate zener diode","motor speed","PWM operation control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592644","abstract":"Turn off behaviour of power MOSFETS with quasi-clamped inductive switching (QIS) loads is analysed. In most real applications the main inductive load is clamped during turn off but there is enough unclamped inductance in the circuit to cause voltage spikes and avalanche breakdown. This is the QIS situation and occurs in almost all practical circuits from motor drives to inverters to VRMs. Analytical expressions are derived for turn off losses under QIS which take into account the unclamped inductance in the circuit, gate drive parameters and more importantly, the source inductance of the package. The equations also predict the peak voltage during turn off and the conditions that would drive the device into avalanche. A common solution for avalanche prevention during inductive turn off is the protected Mosfet with an integrated drain to gate zener diode. The zener diode forces the Mosfet to turn on, thereby clamping the drain voltage. The trade offs in the design of such protected Mosfets are analysed. The findings are verified in the practical case of a power tool where the motor speed is controlled by PWM operation of a single switch. The circuit has large unclamped inductances arising from wiring and very high peak currents under locked rotor conditions. It is shown that a well designed Mosfet with avalanche protection can survive the locked rotor condition for longer durations, thereby increasing the overall product reliability.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592644","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592644","startPage":"4349","endPage":"4354","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592644.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quasi-clamped Inductive Switching behaviour of power Mosfets","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Quasi-clamped Inductive Switching behaviour of power Mosfets","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592644/","accessionNumber":"10154815","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592644/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quasi-clamped Inductive Switching behaviour of power Mosfets","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4349-p4354.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060545S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592644","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592668,"authors":[{"name":"Haibing Hu","affiliation":["Aero-Power-Sci-Center, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Haibing Hu","id":"37292019000"},{"name":"Wenxi Yao","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Wenxi Yao","id":"37278460200"},{"name":"Yan Xing","affiliation":["Aero-Power-Sci-Center, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Yan Xing","id":"37270852600"},{"name":"Zhengyu Lu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Power Electronics, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, China"],"lastName":"Zhengyu Lu","id":"37277025100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1667-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1668-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0275-9306"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2377-6617"}],"articleNumber":"4592668","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","IP networks","Pulse width modulation","Switches","Hardware","Signal processing algorithms","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["geometry","PWM power convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["n-level space vector PWM","hardware implementation","geometrical symmetry","multilevel space vector PWM","intellectual property","SVPWM IP core"]}],"abstract":"Based on the close relationships on the dwelling time calculations and the on-time arrangement among all six sectors with geometrical symmetry, a generalized algorithm of multilevel space vector PWM (SVPWM) suitable for hardware implementation is proposed.

It is utilizing the ANPC5L topology as inverter on the grid-side and the simple 2-quadrant ANPC3L topology as rectifier for a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMG). ANPC stands for Active Neutral Point Clamped, which is the base for the derivation of multiple topologies, i.e. 3-, 5- and higher levels. The ANPC5L converter is realized as a hybrid converter based on IGCT (Integrated Gate Commutated Thyristor) presspack devices and IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) modules. The ANPC5L is modulated at 2 kHz. The IGCTs, used as inner switches, are operated at fundamental frequency, which allows a substantial reduction in silicon size. To meet the harmonic limits of the IEEE 519 no additional passive filter is required. To fulfill the more stringent VDEW requirements a simple LC filter is implemented. On the permanent generator side a simplified 2-quadrant 3 level converter (2Q-ANP3L), with 50% less turn-off switches than in a conventional NPC converter, is used. The operation of this simple topology with a discontinuous modulation allows the adjustment of the power factor of the permanent magnet synchronous generator for all operation conditions. The 6 MVA converter has been designed, built and tested in the power lab. The dimensions of the 6 MVA converter prototype, represents one of the most compact designs achieved for windpower applications today.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592678/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592678/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154993","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"6 MVA five-level hybrid converter for windpower","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"6 MVA five-level hybrid converter for windpower","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4532-p4538.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055623S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592678","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592685,"authors":[{"name":"M.

Both passive and active anti-islanding methods exist. Typically, active methods modify a given parameter, which also affects the shape and quality of the injected current. In this paper, an accurate and less-disturbing active method suitable for phase-locked loop (PLL) based controllers is proposed. The PLL structure is built using a second order generalized integrator (SOGI). Each output cycle the inverter current reference is slightly modified by an injected signal thus affecting the generated current in a negligible way. Therefore, a feedback signal can be extracted from the voltage of the point of common coupling (PCC) as a consequence of the injected signal. When the grid becomes unavailable, the feedback signal extracted from the voltage at PCC moves outside of a preset threshold value. This new active anti-islanding method meets both standard requirements IEEE 929-2000, IEEE 1547.1 and VDE 0126.1.1. The disturbance used by this method is small compared to other active anti-islanding methods, such as active frequency drift or frequency shift up/down. Moreover, this method does not present non-detection-zones (NDZ), it does not affect the zero-crossing of the injected current and it can also estimate the grid impedance. In addition, the method is highly robust to different grid disturbances and stiffness, and is effective for multiple inverters running in parallel. The performance of the proposed method has been studied through extensive simulations using MATLAB/Simulink for several operating conditions and load types and then successfully tested on an experimental setup. Selected results are presented in order to confirm the validity of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accurate and less-disturbing active anti-islanding method based on PLL for grid-connected PV Inverters","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592685","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592685.pdf","startPage":"4569","endPage":"4576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592685/","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Accurate and less-disturbing active anti-islanding method based on PLL for grid-connected PV Inverters","conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592685/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154999","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accurate and less-disturbing active anti-islanding method based on PLL for grid-connected PV Inverters","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4569-p4576.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063807S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592685","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4592695,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The quantification of ageing is made thanks to the monitoring of model parameters changes. The UC modeling uses a description of the main physical properties as porous nature of the electrodes. The model is defined by four main parameters which are identified thanks to specific characterization tests based on impedance spectroscopy. This model is validated for a new UC under different conditions of voltage and temperature. Then a power cycling methodology is applied. First, the specification of current profiles is made according to both power requirements in hybrid and electric vehicles applications and intrinsic properties of the UC. In order to have significant self heating, a current shape is chosen and used in a preliminary test allowing to verify that the thermal steady state is properly obtained. Then, the power cycling tests is started and the UC parameters changes are recorded thanks to periodic characterization tests. Finally, the results of the accelerated ageing are presented. They show two major effects that are opposed. The first one is the UC performances fading during power cycling tests and the second one is the performances recovery during the rest periods. The evolution of the impedance model parameters is presented and the link to physics is discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PESC.2008.4592695","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power Electronics Specialists Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4578427/4591876/04592695.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PESC.2008.4592695","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4591876","startPage":"4624","endPage":"4629","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parameters evolution of an ultracapacitor impedance model with ageing during power cycling tests","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parameters evolution of an ultracapacitor impedance model with ageing during power cycling tests","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-19 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592695/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"15-19 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10154742","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4592695/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameters evolution of an ultracapacitor impedance model with ageing during power cycling tests","confLoc":"Rhodes, Greece","sourcePdf":"PESC08-p4624-p4629.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041598S","chronDate":"15-19 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4578427","isNumber":"4591876","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4578427","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4591876","articleId":"4592695","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4592708,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Yeul Park","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Sung-Yeul","lastName":"Park","id":"37280896900"},{"name":"Hidekazu Miwa","affiliation":["Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA"],"firstName":"Hidekazu","lastName":"Miwa","id":"37533247400"},{"name":"Brian T.

Here, the MPDTC algorithm is augmented with a suitable infeasibility exit strategy which is activated when the voltage vector selection problem does not admit a solution, and provides a stable and reliable operation of the drive throughout its operating range. The algorithm is embedded in the control software environment of ABB's ACS6000 medium voltage drive, and experimental results are provided which verify the advantageous features of MPDTC in terms of average inverter switching frequency reduction.

Then use Matlab/Simulink software to set up the model including passive and semi-active control and simulate. The results show that the semi-active control is more effective than the passive control, the body acceleration has declined by 20% and ride quality has improved observably.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Suspensions","Mathematical model","Erbium","Fluids","Artificial neural networks","Control systems","Shock absorbers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrorheology","neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","suspensions (mechanical components)","variable structure systems","vibration control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sliding mode semiactive control","suspension","electrorheological fluid","ER damper","quarter car dynamic model","state space equation","pole assignment","proportion switching method","RBF neural network arithmetic","Matlab/Simulink software"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["electro-rheological","semi-active control","sliding mode control","RBF neural network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4592787","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04592787.pdf","startPage":"6143","endPage":"6148","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4592787","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A sliding mode semi-active control for suspension based on neural network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A sliding mode semi-active control for suspension based on neural network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592787/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592787/","accessionNumber":"10343067","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A sliding mode semi-active control for suspension based on neural network","confLoc":"Chongqing","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-1185.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066487S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4592787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4592788,"authors":[{"name":"Aiwen Guo","affiliation":["Department of Automation, College of Power&Mechanical Engineering, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Aiwen Guo","id":"37087798731"},{"name":"Jiandong Yang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Jiandong Yang","id":"37087492434"},{"name":"Haiyan Bao","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Science, Wuhan University of China, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Haiyan Bao","id":"37087796658"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4592788","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592788","abstract":"Proportional, integral and differential are defined as a neuron respectively, combined with neural network in this paper.

Finally, the improved WNN is applied to the fault diagnosis of piston compressor, in which the results show it is superior to the common WNN in the aspects of precision and convergence.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592852/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10343427","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592852/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fault diagnosis of piston compressor based on Wavelet Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault diagnosis of piston compressor based on Wavelet Neural Network and Genetic Algorithm","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-1157.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047828S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4592852","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4592892,"authors":[{"name":"Qingle Pang","affiliation":["School of Information and Electronic Engineering, Shandong Institute of Business and Technology, Yantai, Shandong, China"],"lastName":"Qingle Pang","id":"37087352022"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4592892","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Current measurement","Training","Harmonic analysis","Transient analysis","Feature extraction","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision tables","earthing","EMTP","fault currents","fault diagnosis","feature extraction","neural nets","power system harmonics","rough set theory","signal detection","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rough set neural network","fault line detection","neutral noneffectively grounded system","single-phase-to-earth fault experiment","ATP-EMTP simulation program","fault feature extraction","wavelet transform","fifth harmonic current method","zero sequence current active component method","fundamental current component amplitude comparison","fault measure","data table","data discretization","decision table","attribute reduction","rule reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Neutral non-effectively grounded system","Fault line detection","Rough set theory","Neural network"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592892","abstract":"A novel fault line detection method based on rough set neural network is proposed to avoid the longtime training and the complicated model structure for the neural network based fault line detection model.

The fault features are extracted from zero sequence currents by using wavelet transform method, the fifth harmonic current method, zero sequence current active component method and fundamental current component amplitude comparison. These fault features are transformed into fault measures according to properties of each fault feature. The fault measures of lines make up of the original data table and these discretized data construct decision table. Then the decision table is reduced through attribute reduction and rule reduction. The reduced condition attributes are regarded as inputs of the neural network and the reduced samples are used to training neural network. The neural network model trained can realize fault line detection. The simulation results show that the method reaches higher training speed and lower error rate.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4592892","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04592892.pdf","startPage":"6550","endPage":"6554","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4592892","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rough set neural network based fault line detection for neutral non-effectively grounded system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Rough set neural network based fault line detection for neutral non-effectively grounded system","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10343709","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4592892/","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rough set neural network based fault line detection for neutral non-effectively grounded system","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-1267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064363S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4592892","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4592909,"authors":[{"name":"Biao Luo","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Biao Luo","id":"37087065979"},{"name":"Jinhua Zheng","affiliation":["Institute of Information and Engineering, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan, Hunan, China"],"lastName":"Jinhua Zheng","id":"37087251968"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4592909","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"abstract":"Searching robust solutions in multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) usually optimize effective objective functions instead of original objective functions. It needs sampling in a \u03b4-neighborhood of an individual. Fitness of every sample must be evaluated, so large computation of MOEAs becomes an urgent problem. To solve the flaw of low efficiency resulted from fixed sample size, this paper combined NSGA-II with Random Sampling(RS) and Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) to search robust optimal solutions, and proposed an adaptive sampling technique which changes the sample size adaptively in the sampling process. It reduces unnecessary samples and fitness evaluations. Accordingly, two sampling methods named Adaptive RS (ARS) and Adaptive LHS (ALHS) were designed. The experimental results demonstrate that ARS and ALHS can reduce CPU time and fitness evaluations significantly compared with RS and LHS in the condition of not degrading the performance of MOEAs in searching robust optimal solutions. In a word, the adaptive sampling technique can improve the efficiency of MOEA obviously.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Approximation methods","Hypercubes","Sampling methods","Optimization","Accuracy","Reactive power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","random processes","sampling methods","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective evolutionary algorithms","adaptive sampling technique","searching robust optimal solutions","NSGA-II","random sampling","RS","Latin hypercube sampling"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MOEAs","efficient","robust optimal solutions","adaptive sampling","fitness evaluations"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4592909","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04592909.pdf","startPage":"117","endPage":"123","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4592909","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient MOEAs with an adaptive sampling technique in searching robust optimal solutions","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592909","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efficient MOEAs with an adaptive sampling technique in searching robust optimal solutions","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4592909/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4592909/","accessionNumber":"10354143","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient MOEAs with an adaptive sampling technique in searching robust optimal solutions","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-0023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066626S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4592909","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4592914,"authors":[{"name":"Haixiang Guo","affiliation":["College of Management and Economics, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Haixiang Guo","id":"37087350504"},{"name":"Kejun Zhu","affiliation":["College of Management and Economics, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Kejun Zhu","id":"37087349523"},{"name":"Jie Hu","affiliation":["College of Management and Economics, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Jie Hu","id":"37087187360"},{"name":"Ting Liu","affiliation":["College of Management and Economics, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Ting Liu","id":"37087157999"},{"name":"Jingjing Zhou","affiliation":["College of Management and Economics, China University of Geoscience, Wuhan, Hubei, China"],"lastName":"Jingjing Zhou","id":"37087946677"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4592914","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4592914","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Petroleum","Data mining","Reservoirs","Feature extraction","Accuracy","Gallium","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","data analysis","feature extraction","genetic algorithms","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data driven","feature selection","soft computing","data-information-cognition","BP neural network","genetic algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["feature selection","reservoir","well log attribute"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposed an algorithm of feature selection used in fusion of soft computing and based on the chain of data-information-cognition.

A chaotic optimization-based simple particle swarm optimization equation with constriction factor is developed. Piecewise linear chaotic map is employed to perform chaotic optimization due to its ergodicity and stochasticity. Consequently, the particles are accelerated to overstep the local extremum in sCFPSO algorithm. The experiment results of six classic benchmark functions show that the proposed algorithm improves extraordinarily the convergence velocity and precision in evolutionary optimization, and can break away efficiently from the local extremum. Furthermore, the algorithm obtains better optimization results with smaller populations and evolutionary generations.

The features are attained by localizing the fast Fourier transformations (FFT) of the signals to specific windows localized in time. An interpolation approach is applied to reduce intra-class variations by smoothing the spectra for each signal. Some important parameters such as the overlaps of the FFT window, the points of interpolation during feature extraction are optimized by genetic algorithm (GA).

Unlike other method taking the wavelet coefficients directly as features, our method using the wavelet energy density features instead. The proposed approach consists of a feature extraction stage for extracting wavelet energy density features with wavelets transform, and a classification stage for classifying handwritten characters with a simple neural network. In order to verify the performance of the proposed method, experiments are carried out on handwritten numerals recognition. Experimental results indicate that the WEDF is stable and reliable in handwritten character recognition and performs better than wavelet coefficient feature, it provides high recognition rate on both training samples and testing samples.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4593084/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10344145","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4593084/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Unconstrained handwritten character recognition based on WEDF and Multilayer Neural Network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unconstrained handwritten character recognition based on WEDF and Multilayer Neural Network","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-0214.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06303S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4593084","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4593086,"authors":[{"name":"Yanfang Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Yanfang Zhang","id":"37578371600"},{"name":"Saicong Xu","affiliation":["College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Saicong Xu","id":"37286817300"},{"name":"Nongliang Sun","affiliation":["College of Information and Electrical Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, Qingdao, China"],"lastName":"Nongliang Sun","id":"37287665900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4593086","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"abstract":"Skull recognition system based on embedded hidden Markov model (EHMM) has been developed.

Experiments are carried out on a database of 480 different skull images, which consists of 12 different head orientations, performed by 40 individuals. The recognition accuracy is 93.3%, which proves that this method is robust against the variation of skull orientation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04593086.pdf","startPage":"1153","endPage":"1158","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593086","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4593086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Skull recognition based on Embedded Hidden Markov models","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Skull","Hidden Markov models","Image segmentation","Image recognition","Viterbi algorithm","Databases","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete cosine transforms","hidden Markov models","image recognition","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["skull recognition","embedded hidden Markov models","two dimensional discrete cosine transform","frontal skull images","skull deflection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["skull recognition","Embedded Hidden Markov Model","Two dimensional discrete cosine transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4593086/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Skull recognition based on Embedded Hidden Markov models","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4593086/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10344146","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Skull recognition based on Embedded Hidden Markov models","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-0216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082513S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4593086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4593101,"authors":[{"name":"Bingjie Guo","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Bingjie Guo","id":"37087220319"},{"name":"Yuru Xu","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yuru Xu","id":"37087158913"},{"name":"Lei Wan","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Lei Wan","id":"37087220633"},{"name":"Xibin Li","affiliation":["College of Shipbuilding Engineering, Harbin Engineering of Technology, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Xibin Li","id":"37087986300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4593101","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4593101","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Fuzzy neural networks","Underwater vehicles","Artificial neural networks","Genetic algorithms","Adaptation model","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","underwater vehicles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["T-S norm fuzzy neural network controller","underwater vehicles","hybrid learning algorithm","immune genetic algorithm","membership functions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["T-S norm fuzzy neural network","underwater vehicles","immune genetic algorithm","hybrid learning algorithms"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593101","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04593101.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","startPage":"1241","endPage":"1246","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"T-S norm fuzzy neural network controller for underwater vehicles based on hybrid learning algorithm","abstract":"Aiming at the problems that fuzzy neural network controller has heavy computation and response lag, a T-S fuzzy neural network based on hybrid learning algorithm was proposed.

This paper presents a two-level control structure for the active magnetic bearing system. The analog proportional derivative (PD) controllers are used in the low-level, a supervision controller in the upper-level. In this application, the step response models of the plant are identified from experimental data using frequency sampling filter method.

and linear feedback based trajectory control method for robot manipulators","abstract":"This paper addresses the issue of trajectory tracking control based on a neural network controller for industrial manipulators. A new control scheme is proposed based on neural network technology and linear feedback approach for tracking a planned trajectory. The control system is established with two parallel subsystems designed separately. One is a linear controller based on state feedback with respect to a manifold that prescribed the desirable trajectory tracking performance, and another one is a learning controller designed with two neural networks. The former ensures trajectory tracking error regulation, the later is for force/torque generation required by the designed dynamic trajectory. A leaning law for online weight updating of the neural networks is derived such that the trajectory tracking accuracy is improved while the system remains in stable. Stability is analyzed using Lyapunov stability theory. Dynamic trajectory tracking control simulations are carried out on an industrial robot AdeptOne arm. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and usefulness of the proposed control scheme.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4593158/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10343078","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4593158/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A neural network and linear feedback based trajectory control method for robot manipulators","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network and linear feedback based trajectory control method for robot manipulators","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-0305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072324S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4593158","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4593184,"authors":[{"name":"Zhibin Xie","affiliation":["School of Information Science Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Zhibin Xie","id":"37690671300"},{"name":"Jinkuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Jinkuan Wang","id":"37280537400"},{"name":"Yun Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Yun Wang","id":"37697569700"},{"name":"Jing Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Science Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Jing Gao","id":"37405516000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4593184","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Antennas","MIMO","Artificial neural networks","Transmitting antennas","Receivers","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","error statistics","fading channels","matrix algebra","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna selection","MIMO system","spatial correlated fading","multiple input multiple output system","frame error rate","sorted QR decomposition","channel matrix"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems","frame error rate (FER)","wireless communication","antenna selection"]}],"abstract":"Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems are considered as potential candidates for future high data rates wireless networks.

The two patterns indicate that the listed companies are divided into two groups in terms of their business conditions: credit default group (ST and *ST listed companies) and credit non-default group (normal listed companies). Four main financial indexes are considered: earning per share, net asset per share, return on equity, cash flow per share. The simulating results showed that, after 20 training steps, SOM neural network enters into a steady state and the overall discriminant accuracy rate is 99.75%. The LVQ neural network, but nevertheless, becomes steady after 300 training epochs and the overall discriminant accuracy rate is 92.79%. Therefore this indicates that the credit risk evaluation model based on self-organizing feature map neural network we established is better than the one based on learning vector quantization neural network.

It is difficult and challenging in view of the complicated effects on load by a variety of factors. To appropriately capture the complex features of load, this paper presents a novel similar day-based wavelet neural network method. The key idea is to use a similar day technique to select good input load, use wavelet to decompose the load into low and high frequency components, and then use separate neural networks to predict the different frequency components. Factors affecting these frequency components are identified. Numerical testing shows that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-term load forecasting: Similar day-based wavelet neural networks","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593457","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04593457.pdf","startPage":"3353","endPage":"3358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4593457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4593457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Short-term load forecasting: Similar day-based wavelet neural networks","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4593457/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10343342","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Short-term load forecasting: Similar day-based wavelet neural networks","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-0638.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079382S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4593457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4593497,"authors":[{"name":"Yun Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Yun Wang","id":"37697569700"},{"name":"Jinkuan Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Jinkuan Wang","id":"37280537400"},{"name":"Zhibin Xie","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China"],"lastName":"Zhibin Xie","id":"37690671300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4593497","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":231},"abstract":"We present a new receiver structure able to deliver high data rates in a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) frequency selective wireless environment.

Because of the complexity of steam turbine and particularity of its running environment, the fault rate of steam turbine is high and its harm is serious. So the fault diagnosis of steam turbine is a difficult problem. A novel approach for fault diagnosis of steam turbine based on improved neural network is brought forward, aimed at overcoming shortages of some current knowledge attaining methods. An application of artificial neural networks methodology was investigated using experimental data. Multiplayer backpropagation neural network with two hidden layers, hyperbolic tangent as the activation function and target function were studied. Neuro-fuzzy systems were also applied. Based on the ontology of neural network, the data mining algorithm for classified fault diagnosis rules about steam turbine is brought forward; its realization process is as follows: (1) computing the measurement matrix of effect; (2) extracting rules; (3) computing the importance of rules; (4) shearing the rules by genetic algorithm. An experimental system for data mining and fault diagnosis of steam turbine based on neural network is implemented. Its diagnosis precision is 84%.

Through analysis of electrics and mechanics of the RF switch, a novel MEMS four-resonance switch is presented in this paper. The actuation voltage, insertion loss and isolation of the switch are 7 V, 0.69 dB@10.4 GHz, 30.8 dB@10.4 GHz respectively. The alternating direction implicit finite-difference time-domain (ADI-FDTD) method for a full three-dimensional (3-D) wave presented is used for modeling and analyzing the micromachine switch for the first time. The numerical method is unconditionally stable. The limitation of the maximum the time-step size of the method does not depend on the Courant-Friedrich-Levy (CFL) condition, but rather on numerical errors. Therefore, the time-step size can be arbitrarily set within numerical errors when this method is used. Associated with practical model, Murpsilas superabsorbing boundary condition was developed. It has been demonstrated that, with this technique, space discretization with only a few cells per wavelength gives accurate results, leading to a reduction of CPU computation time and improvement of computation efficiency. Based on ADI-FDTD simulation techniques, a novel concept of multi-resonance switch and its equivalent circuit are proposed. Computed results shows that the multi-resonance switch not only can work in multiple frequency bands, but also has better isolation performance in lower frequency, and thus extending the application to the lower band.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04593613.pdf","startPage":"4295","endPage":"4298","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593613","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4593613","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algorithm of four-resonances MEMS capacitive switch using ADI-FDTD","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Switches","Time domain analysis","Artificial neural networks","Microwave theory and techniques","Microswitches","Optical switches","Finite difference methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite difference time-domain analysis","microswitches","resonance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["four-resonances MEMS capacitive switch","ADI-FDTD","radio frequency field","alternating direction implicit finite-difference time-domain method","full three-dimensional wave","micromachine switch","multi-resonance switch"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Micro/nano electronic mechanical system","four-resonance switch","ADI-FDTD method","Mur\u2019s superabsorbing boundary condition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4593613/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Algorithm of four-resonances MEMS capacitive switch using ADI-FDTD","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4593613/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10344160","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algorithm of four-resonances MEMS capacitive switch using ADI-FDTD","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-0819.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.112341S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4593613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4593621,"authors":[{"name":"Liangfeng Li","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Liangfeng Li","id":"37087363835"},{"name":"Xiaoyun Liu","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Xiaoyun Liu","id":"37087364154"},{"name":"Wufan Chen","affiliation":["School of Automation Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, Sichuan, China"],"lastName":"Wufan Chen","id":"37087179666"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4593621","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy control","Fuzzy neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Inference algorithms","Simulation","Adaptation model","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","fuzzy neural nets","fuzzy reasoning","learning (artificial intelligence)","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","pendulums"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["variable universe fuzzy control algorithm","fuzzy neural network","contraction-expansion factors","fuzzy inference","quadruple inverted pendulum system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["variable universe","fuzzy neural network","contraction-expansion factor","inverted pendulum"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4593621","abstract":"In the conventional variable universe fuzzy control system, it was hard to select the function models of the contraction-expansion factors and parameters of the models.

An asymptotic stability of CNNs with time delays was considered by constructing a new suitable Lyapunov functional and some matrix inequality technique. A novel delay-independent stability criterion which considered the excitatory and inhibitory connection was given in terms of matrix inequalities. This condition was expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which can be easily checked by various recently developed algorithms in solving convex optimization problems. Numerical examples are provided to show that the proposed stability result is less conservative than some previously established ones in the literature.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593636","startPage":"4430","endPage":"4433","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04593636.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel criterion for global asymptotic stability of cellular neural networks with time delays","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Asymptotic stability","Stability analysis","Cellular neural networks","Artificial neural networks","Numerical stability","Stability criteria","Delay effects"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asymptotic stability","cellular neural nets","convex programming","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","stability criteria"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["global asymptotic stability","cellular neural networks","CNN","time delays","Lyapunov functional","delay-independent stability criterion","linear matrix inequalities","convex optimization problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Novel criterion","Global asymptotic stability","Cellular neural networks (CNN)","Time delay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4593636/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel criterion for global asymptotic stability of cellular neural networks with time delays","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4593636/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10344250","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel criterion for global asymptotic stability of cellular neural networks with time delays","confLoc":"Chongqing","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-0846.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079132S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4593636","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4593642,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"p":["Wu Rui (1976~), female, lecturer, Ph.D candidate lsqwurui@sina.com;"]},"lastName":"Rui Wu","id":"37675906000"},{"name":"Chang Su","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Chang Su","id":"38090997400"},{"name":"Kewen Xia","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xia Kewen (1965~), male, Ph.D, Professor, Ph.D candidate supervisor."]},"lastName":"Kewen Xia","id":"37411882100"},{"name":"Yi Wu","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Hebei University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Yi Wu","id":"38090956900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4593642","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"abstract":"Support vector machines (SVM) can overcome the disadvantage of traditional anomaly detection, which need large sample data and have great effect in real-time detection, but has the disadvantage of slow training velocity.

So a weighted LS-SVM (WLS-SVM) based on quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is presented, which builds a mixed kernel function, adds self adapting weights in LS-SVM, and solves the linear system of equations with QPSO algorithm. It can increase the performance of LS-SVM, accelerate the rate of convergence, save the memory and always get the least square solution.

Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain good approximation ability and tracing control of nonlinear dynamic system.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593689","startPage":"4736","endPage":"4740","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04593689.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593689","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Fuzzy Neural Network Approximator with Exponential Fast Terminal Sliding Mode","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Approximation methods","Fuzzy neural networks","Approximation algorithms","Approximation error","Algorithm design and analysis","Fuzzy control","Convergence"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural nets","Lyapunov methods","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear functions","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy neural network approximator","exponential fast terminal sliding mode","learning algorithm","unknown nonlinear continuous functions","Lyapunov stability analysis","unstable nonlinear system","nonlinear dynamic system","tracing control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fuzzy neural network","Sliding mode","Learning algorithm","Approximator"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4593689/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Fuzzy Neural Network Approximator with Exponential Fast Terminal Sliding Mode","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4593689/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","accessionNumber":"10343015","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Fuzzy Neural Network Approximator with Exponential Fast Terminal Sliding Mode","confLoc":"Chongqing","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-0908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056239S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4593689","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4593704,"authors":[{"name":"Gangquan Si","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Gangquan Si","id":"37087152791"},{"name":"Hui Cao","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Hui Cao","id":"37087448531"},{"name":"Yanbin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Yanbin Zhang","id":"37087153120"},{"name":"Lixin Jia","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Xi''an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"lastName":"Lixin Jia","id":"37087739434"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4593704","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":103},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Sensors","Niobium","Sensor fusion","Temperature sensors","Fuzzy control","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ball milling","fuzzy control","MIMO systems","neurocontrollers","pulverised fuels","radial basis function networks","sensor fusion","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information fusion","RBF neural network","fuzzy control","ball mill pulverizing system","MIMO system","mathematic model","conventional control strategy","feature extraction","time-varying characteristic","multisensor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ball mill pulverizing system","Information fusion","RBF neural networks","Fuzzy control"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4593704","abstract":"Ball mill pulverizing system is a typical multi-input and multi-output (MIMO) system with the characteristics as strong coupling, nonlinearity, large delay and time-varying. The running conditions and the precise mathematic model of the system can not be obtained easily for its complex characteristics, so the conventional control strategy is not effective. An information fusion based method including multi-sensors, data preprocessing, RBF neural networks, fuzzy controller is put forward in this article. By combining multiple sensorspsila information, the RBF neural networks extract features and estimate the running conditions, and then the adjustments of outputs are decided by fuzzy control. By using the fusion method, the running conditionspsila measurements are more accurate and reliable than that using single sensor method and the control system can adapt to the time-varying characteristic of the ball mill pulverizing system. The practical application indicates that the information fusion based control system runs stably and efficiently.","doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593704","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04593704.pdf","startPage":"4813","endPage":"4818","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Information Fusion based on RBF Neural Networks and Fuzzy Control to Ball Mill Pulverizing System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4593704/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of Information Fusion based on RBF Neural Networks and Fuzzy Control to Ball Mill Pulverizing System","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10343100","publicationDate":"June 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4593704/","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Information Fusion based on RBF Neural Networks and Fuzzy Control to Ball Mill Pulverizing System","confLoc":"Chongqing","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-0923.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081169S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4593704","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4593711,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Junsong","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Wang Junsong","id":"37087878220"},{"name":"Lu Shengli","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tianjin University of Technology, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Lu Shengli","id":"37087452040"},{"name":"Xie Chao","affiliation":["Department of Automation, Tianjin University, TJU, Tianjin, China"],"lastName":"Xie Chao","id":"37087945592"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4593711","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4593711","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Robots","Elbow","Artificial neural networks","Intelligent control","Shoulder","Manipulator dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["couplings","neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","robot dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent control","robotic elbow joint","RBF neural network","radial basis function neural network","robotic joint dynamics"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Redial basis function","Robotic elbow joint","Intelligent control"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593711","pdfPath":"/iel5/4577718/4592780/04593711.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 7th World Congress on Intelligent Control and Automation","startPage":"4859","endPage":"4863","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4592780","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WCICA.2008.4593711","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intelligent control of robotic elbow joint based on RBF neural network","abstract":"This paper proposed a robotic elbow joint intelligent control method based on Redial Basis Function neural network(RBF_NN), which is capable of tracking the desired trajectory with high accuracy.

As to signal with samples from abnormal states, approximate coefficients and detail coefficients that correspond to the abnormal data are reserved. Otherwise, only approximate coefficients are retained. As a consequence, the cost related with data storage and transmission is reduced.

Distinct difference from other analytical approaches lies in \u201clinearization\u201d of the neural network model, by which the considered neural network model is transformed into a linear time-variant system.

The first concept consists of the use of the parameter modulation based on chaotic sequence in order to minimize interference caused by the power line and to secure the transmission information. The second idea consists of the use of wavelet transform based on modulus maxima to reduce the noise from a chaotic sequence.

asymptotic stability criteria of Hopfield neural network with time-varying delays","abstract":"In this paper, the global stability of Hopfield neural networks with time-varying delays is investigated by utilizing Lyapunov functional method and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Distinct difference from other analytical approach lies in \u201clinearization\u201d of neural network model, by which the considered neural network model is transformed into a linear time-variant system. Then, a process, which is called parameterized first-order model transformation, is used to transform the linear process. Novel criteria for global asymptotic stability of the unique equilibrium point of Hopfield neural network with time-varying delays are obtained. the obtained results are less conservative and restrictive than those established in the earlier references. Numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our proposed method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594023/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10343250","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4594023/","publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"25-27 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"New global asymptotic stability criteria of Hopfield neural network with time-varying delays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New global asymptotic stability criteria of Hopfield neural network with time-varying delays","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"WCICA08-1383.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050742S","chronDate":"25-27 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4577718","isNumber":"4592780","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4577718","xplore-issue":"4592780","articleId":"4594023","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4594040,"authors":[{"name":"Haixia Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science and Engineering, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China","Department of Computer and Modern Education Technology, Chongqing Education College, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Haixia Wu","id":"37087280615"},{"name":"Wei Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Modern Education Technology, Chongqing Education College, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Zhang","id":"37087173341"},{"name":"Wei Feng","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Modern Education Technology, Chongqing Education College, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Wei Feng","id":"37087189269"},{"name":"Pengcheng Wei","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Modern Education Technology, Chongqing Education College, Chongqing, China"],"lastName":"Pengcheng Wei","id":"37087845328"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2113-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2114-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4594040","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":34},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Uncertainty","Symmetric matrices","Robust stability","Delay","Cellular neural networks","Stability analysis","Asymptotic stability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular neural nets","delays","linear matrix inequalities","Lyapunov methods","stability criteria","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-dependent robust stability criteria","cellular neural networks","variable delays","LMI","time-varying delays","parametric uncertainties","Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional","linear matrix inequality"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["robust stability","DCNNs","LMI","uncertainties"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594040","abstract":"The stability of cellular neural networks (CNNs) with time-varying delays and parametric uncertainties is investigated in the present paper.

Because traditional GM (1, 1) forecasting model is not accurate and the value of parameter alpha is constant, so this paper put forward a improved genetic algorithm - GM (1, 1) (IGA-GM (1, 1)), the proposed algorithm were used to solve the problem of short-term load forecasting (STLF) in power system. In order to construct optimal grey model GM (1, 1) to enhance the accuracy of forecasting, the improved decimal-code genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to search the optimal alpha value of grey model GM (1, 1). Whatpsila s more, this paper also proposes the one-point linearity arithmetical crossover, which can greatly improve the speed of crossover and mutation. Then, a comparison of the performance has been made between IGA-GM (1, 1) and traditional GM (1, 1) forecasting model. Finally, a daily load forecasting example is used to test the IGA-GM (1, 1) model.

In the hybrid algorithm, estimation function is composed of a linear combination of a series of feature spaces, which is optimized by linear programming, and particle swarm optimization is used effectively for the regression parameters selection.

The algorithm possesses the capability of ergodic random search due to chaos mechanism, and it can control the departure of chaos state by annealing strategy.

Based on analysis of pixel vector sampled among multi-images, VSAR may effectively suppress the strong ground clutter and improve moving target detection and location. In this paper, different Doppler-distributed properties are derived for the moving target and clutter, respectively. Then, we propose a novel parametric statistical model for VSAR by dividing the pixel vector into three components, namely, target, clutter, and noise. Furthermore, a method of adaptive implementation of optimal processing (AIOP-VSAR) is presented for moving target detection. It is shown that the optimum detection performance may be obtained via AIOP-VSAR, particularly for the slowly moving target in an inhomogeneous clutter environment. Also, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) are derived for the estimation of unknown model parameters, as well as the azimuth locations of moving targets, and the maximum-likelihood methods are proposed to reach these CRBs. Based on the proposed target detection and parameter estimation methods, we present a complete parametric flowchart for VSAR. It is demonstrated that the proposed flowchart may effectively mitigate the \"azimuth location ambiguity\" of VSAR and has the super-resolution ability to resolve \"velocity layover\" for multiple targets. Finally, some detailed numerical experiments and scene simulations are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2008.918016","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/4603104/04594619.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603104","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2008.918016","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","startPage":"2463","endPage":"2480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parametric Velocity Synthetic Aperture Radar:Signal Modeling and Optimal Methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594619","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Parametric Velocity Synthetic Aperture Radar:Signal Modeling and Optimal Methods","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594619/","volume":"46","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4594619/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177356","dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parametric Velocity Synthetic Aperture Radar:Signal Modeling and Optimal Methods","sourcePdf":"46tgrs09-xu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.150958S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"4603104","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"4603104","articleId":"4594619","onlineDate":"08 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4594621,"authors":[{"name":"Jasper A.

The main focus in this research has been on the development of a single universal genetic operator for population evolution that is always efficient for a diverse set of optimization problems. In this paper, we argue that significant advances to the field of evolutionary computation can be made if we embrace a concept of self-adaptive multimethod optimization in which multiple different search algorithms are run concurrently, and learn from each other through information exchange using a common population of points. We present an evolutionary algorithm, entitled A Multialgorithm Genetically Adaptive Method for Single Objective Optimization (AMALGAM-SO), that implements this concept of self adaptive multimethod search. This method simultaneously merges the strengths of the covariance matrix adaptation (CMA) evolution strategy, genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimizer (PSO) for population evolution and implements a self-adaptive learning strategy to automatically tune the number of offspring these three individual algorithms are allowed to contribute during each generation. Benchmark results in 10, 30, and 50 dimensions using synthetic functions from the special session on real-parameter optimization of CEC 2005 show that AMALGAM-SO obtains similar efficiencies as existing algorithms on relatively simple unimodal problems, but is superior for more complex higher dimensional multimodal optimization problems. The new search method scales well with increasing number of dimensions, converges in the close proximity of the global minimum for functions with noise induced multimodality, and is designed to take full advantage of the power of distributed computer networks.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2008.924428","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","pdfPath":"/iel5/4235/4808349/04594621.pdf","startPage":"243","endPage":"259","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4808349","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2008.924428","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Self-Adaptive Multimethod Search for Global Optimization in Real-Parameter Spaces","volume":"13","issue":"2","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4594621/","dateOfInsertion":"31 March 2009","publicationDate":"April 2009","accessionNumber":"10547374","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594621/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Self-Adaptive Multimethod Search for Global Optimization in Real-Parameter Spaces","sourcePdf":"tevc-vrugt-924428.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142155S","chronDate":"April  2009","xplore-pub-id":"4235","isNumber":"4808349","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4235","citationCount":"249","xplore-issue":"4808349","articleId":"4594621","onlineDate":"08 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":4594622,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Therefore, the method is more accurate and computationally attractive. Furthermore, the method does not rely on the eigenvalues of a covariance matrix or the signal/noise power, making it robust against deviations from the assumption of spatially white noise model.

Theorems proposed under this topic form the bridge between the continuous-time signals and discrete-time signals. Several sampling theorems, which aid in the reconstruction of signals in the linear canonical transform (LCT) domain, have been proposed in the literature. However, two main practical issues associated with the sampling of the LCT still remain unresolved. The first one relates to the reconstruction of the original signal from nonuniform samples and the other issue relates to the fact that only a finite number of samples are available practically. Focusing on these issues, this paper seeks to address the above from the LCT point of view. First, we extend several previously developed theorems for signals band-limited in the Fourier domain to signals band-limited in the LCT domain, followed by the derivation of the reconstruction formulas for finite uniform or recurrent nonuniform sampling points associated with the LCT. Simulation results and the potential applications of the theorem are also proposed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4652320","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.929333","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4652320/04594627.pdf","startPage":"5454","endPage":"5464","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.929333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Sampling of Band-Limited Signals Associated With the Linear Canonical Transform","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2008","displayDocTitle":"On Sampling of Band-Limited Signals Associated With the Linear Canonical Transform","volume":"56","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/4594627/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2008","accessionNumber":"10265498","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594627/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Sampling of Band-Limited Signals Associated With the Linear Canonical Transform","sourcePdf":"56tsp11-tao.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075296S","chronDate":"Nov.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4652320","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"4652320","articleId":"4594627","onlineDate":"08 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4594628,"authors":[{"name":"Saeed Sharifi Tehrani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, QUE, Canada"],"firstName":"Saeed","lastName":"Sharifi Tehrani","id":"37286463800"},{"name":"Christophe Jego","affiliation":["TELECOM Bretagne, CNRS Laboratory-STICC FRE, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Jego","id":"37271502500"},{"name":"Bo Zhu","affiliation":["Nortel Networks Limited, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38088631000"},{"name":"Warren J.

This approach provides a new solution for traffic modeling and characterization, workload and performance prediction, capacity planning, and statistical anomaly detection of network intrusions.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586225/4594630/04594705.pdf","startPage":"378","endPage":"383","publicationTitle":"2008 8th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2008.4594705","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2008.4594705","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594630","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Periodic hidden Markov model-based workload clustering and characterization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Web sites","Distance measurement","Clustering algorithms","Computational modeling","Manganese","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["file servers","hidden Markov models","pattern clustering","security of data","Web sites"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["periodic hidden Markov model","workload clustering","Web server","stochastic process","Websites","performance prediction","statistical anomaly detection","network intrusions","capacity planning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594705/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Periodic hidden Markov model-based workload clustering and characterization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4594705/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156752","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"8-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic hidden Markov model-based workload clustering and characterization","confLoc":"Sydney, NSW, Australia","sourcePdf":"CI080076.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055212S","chronDate":"8-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586225","isNumber":"4594630","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586225","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4594630","articleId":"4594705","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4594716,"authors":[{"name":"Chen-Tung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Information Management, National United University, Miaoli, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chen-Tung Chen","id":"37087711856"},{"name":"Hui-Ling Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Cultural Development, Hungkuang University, Taichung, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hui-Ling Cheng","id":"37087981151"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2357-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2358-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4594716","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":85},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision making","Distance measurement","Information systems","Transforms","Numerical models","Aggregates","Electronic mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","decision theory","fuzzy set theory","information systems","operations research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["group decision making model","2-tuple linguistic variable assessment","information system selection","TOPSIS concept","linguistic positive-ideal solution","linguistic negative-ideal solution","multicriteria decision making problem","fuzzy set theory"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594716","abstract":"In decision making problems with multiple experts as group decision making (GDM), each expert expresses his/her preferences or judgments depending on his/her own knowledge or experiences.

These receiver designs can also be used to obtain reduced complexity. The performance of the SOMA schemes are compared to achievable rate bounds for multi-level D-BLAST based schemes. The D-BLAST receivers illustrate general limitations of non-iterative approaches.

The core of LBS is an effective positioning system. As wireless LAN (WLAN) costs less and is easy to access, using WLAN for indoor positioning has been widely studied recently. K nearest neighbors (KNN) is one of the basic deterministic fingerprint based algorithms and widely used for WLAN-based indoor positioning. However, KNN takes all the nearest K neighbors for calculating the estimated result, which could be improved if some selective work could be done to those neighbors beforehand. In this paper we propose a new scheme called \"cluster filtered KNN\" (CFK). CFK utilizes clustering technique to partition those neighbors into different clusters and chooses one cluster as the delegate. In the end, the final estimate can be calculated only based on the elements of the delegate. With experiments, we found that CFK does outperform KNN.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586176/4594794/04594840.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2008.4594840","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2008.4594840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594840","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cluster filtered KNN: A WLAN-based indoor positioning scheme","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Distance measurement","Wireless LAN","Fingerprint recognition","Nearest neighbor searches","Databases","Wireless communication","Buildings"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cluster approximation","filtering theory","position control","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["KNN","WLAN","indoor positioning","location based service","wireless LAN","K nearest neighbors","fingerprint","cluster filtering"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cluster filtered KNN: A WLAN-based indoor positioning scheme","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4594840/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10156023","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cluster filtered KNN: A WLAN-based indoor positioning scheme","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"20027_87579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076244S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586176","isNumber":"4594794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586176","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4594794","articleId":"4594840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4594846,"authors":[{"name":"Jia Tang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Jia Tang","id":"37276757500"},{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Xi Zhang","id":"37279333400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4594846","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":220},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Resource management","Delay","Bandwidth","Wireless networks","Wireless communication","Relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","OFDM modulation","power consumption","quality of service","queueing theory","resource allocation","stochastic processes","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-delay tradeoff","wireless networks","stochastic traffic flows","queuing-delay bound","power consumption","delay quality-of-service constraint","queue-length decaying rate","orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing communications","point-to-point link","multihop amplify-and-forward network","multiuser cellular network","optimal resource-allocation policies"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power control","quality-of-service (QoS)","resource allocation and management","scheduling","convex optimization","information theory"]}],"abstract":"When transmitting stochastic traffic flows over wireless networks, there exists an inherent tradeoff between average transmit power and corresponding queuing-delay bound. In this paper, we investigate such a trade-off and show how average power increases as delay-bound requirement becomes stringent. Specifically, we propose the resource allocation schemes to minimize the power consumption subject to a delay quality-of-service (QoS) constraint, where the delay constraint is in terms of queue-length decaying rate when an arrival traffic is transmitted through the wireless networks. We focus on orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) communications under three different network infrastructures, namely, point-to-point link, multihop amplify-and-forward (AF) network, and multiuser cellular network. We derive the optimal resource allocation policies for each scenario, and compare their performances with other existing resource-allocation policies. The obtained simulation and numerical results show that using our proposed optimal resource-allocation policies, significant power saving can be achieved. Furthermore, our OFDM-based communications systems can significantly save the power consumption, especially under stringent delay constraint.","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2008.4594846","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586176/4594794/04594846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2008.4594846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594794","startPage":"1","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power-delay tradeoff over wireless networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Power-delay tradeoff over wireless networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594846/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10156029","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4594846/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power-delay tradeoff over wireless networks","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"20033_87754.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093102S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586176","isNumber":"4594794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586176","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4594794","articleId":"4594846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4594853,"authors":[{"name":"Hang Su","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Hang Su","id":"37280809500"},{"name":"Xi Zhang","affiliation":["Networking and Information Systems Laboratory, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Xi Zhang","id":"37279333400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2099-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2100-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4594853","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":796},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Protocols","Media Access Protocol","Cognitive radio","Sensors","Analytical models","Transceivers","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","time-varying channels","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio-enabled multichannel MAC protocol","wireless networks","interference","multichannel hidden terminal problem","time-varying channel availability","medium access control layer","transceiver","multiple channel sensors","frequency spectrum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radios","multi-channel MAC protocols","opportunistic spectrum access","IEEE 802.11 DCF"]}],"abstract":"Cognitive radio technology has emerged as the novel and effective approach to improve the utilization of precious radio spectrum. Employing the cognitive radio technology, secondary (unlicensed) users can opportunistically utilize the unused licensed spectrum in a way that constrains the level of interference to the primary (licensed) users. However, there are many new challenges associated with cognitive radio based wireless networks, such as the multi-channel hidden terminal problem and the fact that the time-varying channel availability is different for different secondary users, in the medium access control (MAC) layer. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient cognitive radio-enabled multi-channel MAC (CREAM-MAC) protocol, which integrates the spectrum sensing at physical layer and packet scheduling at MAC layer, over the wireless networks. Under the proposed CREAM-MAC protocol, each secondary user is equipped with a cognitive radio-enabled transceiver and multiple channel sensors. The proposed CREAM-MAC enables the secondary users to best utilize the unused frequency spectrum while avoiding the collisions among secondary users and between secondary users and primary users. In addition, we develop the analytical models to quantitatively analyze our proposed CREAM-MAC protocol in the saturated network case. We also conduct simulation experiments to validate our developed analytical models.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CREAM-MAC: An efficient Cognitive Radio-enAbled Multi-Channel MAC protocol for wireless networks","publicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","doi":"10.1109/WOWMOM.2008.4594853","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Symposium on a World of Wireless, Mobile and Multimedia Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586176/4594794/04594853.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOWMOM.2008.4594853","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594794","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-26 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"CREAM-MAC: An efficient Cognitive Radio-enAbled Multi-Channel MAC protocol for wireless networks","conferenceDate":"23-26 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4594853/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10156037","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CREAM-MAC: An efficient Cognitive Radio-enAbled Multi-Channel MAC protocol for wireless networks","confLoc":"Newport Beach, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"20040_87001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116107S","chronDate":"23-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586176","isNumber":"4594794","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586176","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4594794","articleId":"4594853","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4594888,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Henkel","affiliation":["University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Henkel","id":"37692015600"},{"name":"Timothy X.

The goal is for the ferry to autonomously find routes which minimize the average packet delay in the network. We prove that paths which visit all nodes in a round-trip fashion, i.e., solutions to the traveling salesman problem, do not yield the lowest average packet delay. We propose two novel ferry path planning algorithms based on stochastic modeling and machine learning. We model the path planning task as a Markov decision process with the ferry acting as an independent agent. We apply reinforcement learning to enable the ferry to make optimal decisions.

Previously the properties of interference were known only when the nodes are distributed as a homogeneous Poisson point process on the plane. We show the effect of a singular path loss model on the tail distribution of the interference. When the path loss function has a singularity at the origin, the interference is shown to be a heavy-tailed distribution under very mild conditions. When the path loss is bounded, the distribution of the interference is predominantly dictated by the fading. We also provide asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on the CDF of the interference, and discuss the effectiveness of using a Gaussian approximation for modelling the interference.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference in ad hoc networks with general motion-invariant node distributions","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594936","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04594936.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594936","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Interference in ad hoc networks with general motion-invariant node distributions","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4594936/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156184","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference in ad hoc networks with general motion-invariant node distributions","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000001.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052769S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4594936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-28"},{"_id":4594942,"authors":[{"name":"Randy Cogill","affiliation":["Department of Systems and Information Engineering, University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Randy","lastName":"Cogill","id":"37297180300"},{"name":"Brooke Shrader","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, USA"],"firstName":"Brooke","lastName":"Shrader","id":"37300947000"},{"name":"Anthony Ephremides","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, USA"],"firstName":"Anthony","lastName":"Ephremides","id":"37265761500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4594942","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":89},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594942","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Encoding","Transmitters","Upper bound","Joining processes","Delay","Stability analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","linear codes","multicast communication","random codes","receivers","stability","telecommunication channels","transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["stability analysis","random linear coding","multicast session management","packet stream transmission","head-of-line packet decoding","channel reliability","maximum stable arrival rate"]}],"abstract":"We consider a problem of managing separate multicast sessions from a single transmitter. Each of K sessions has an associated packet stream, and a single transmitter must transmit these packet streams to a group of receivers. The multicast sessions are separate in the sense that each receiver only wants packets from one of the K streams. We will compare the maximum stable arrival rates that can be supported with and without using random linear coding across the K sessions. Intuitively, it seems that coding across sessions is not beneficial. Coding across sessions appears to introduce unnecessary additional delay since each receiver does not receive its next packet until it can decode the head-of-line packets from all K streams. However, we show that in many cases the maximum stable arrival rate that can be supported when coding across sessions is significantly greater than maximum stable arrival rate that can be supported when not coding across sessions. We provide a sufficient condition that indicates when coding across sessions is preferable. This condition is expressed in terms of the number of sessions, the number of receivers per session, and the reliability of the channels connecting the transmitter to the receivers.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594942","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04594942.pdf","startPage":"31","endPage":"35","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594942","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis of random linear coding across multicast sessions","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of random linear coding across multicast sessions","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4594942/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156190","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594942/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of random linear coding across multicast sessions","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000031.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075055S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4594942","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4594946,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"lastName":"Nan Ma","id":"37087699210"},{"name":"Prakash Ishwar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Prakash","lastName":"Ishwar","id":"37284366600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4594946","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":139},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Source coding","Random variables","Entropy","Error probability","Complexity theory","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","block codes","Boolean functions","integral equations","source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["two-terminal distributed source coding","function computation","doubly symmetric binary sources","Bernoulli sources","Boolean AND function computation","infinite-message sum-rate","infinitesimal rate","two-dimensional definite integral"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594946","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-terminal distributed source coding with alternating messages for function computation","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594946","startPage":"51","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04594946.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594946","abstract":"A two-terminal interactive distributed source coding problem with alternating messages is studied.

However, many channels cause erasures in addition to errors. In principle, decoding over such channels can be accomplished by deleting the erased symbols and decoding the resulting vector with respect to a punctured code. For any given linear code and any given maximum number of correctable erasures, we introduce parity-check matrices yielding parity-check equations that do not check any of the erased symbols and which are sufficient to characterize all punctured codes corresponding to this maximum number of erasures. This allows for the separation of erasures from errors to facilitate decoding. The parity-check matrices typically have redundant rows. We give several constructions of such matrices and prove general bounds on their minimum sizes.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594979","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594979","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04594979.pdf","startPage":"215","endPage":"219","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Separating erasures from errors for decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Separating erasures from errors for decoding","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4594979/","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156263","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594979/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Separating erasures from errors for decoding","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000215.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061176S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4594979","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4594985,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohu Shang","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaohu Shang","id":"37087184281"},{"name":"Gerhard Kramer","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Alcatel-Lucent, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Kramer","id":"37275136700"},{"name":"Biao Chen","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA"],"lastName":"Biao Chen","id":"37087183658"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4594985","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":153},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits","Receivers","Interference","USA Councils","Noise","Electronic mail","Noise measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","Gaussian channels","interference (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channels capacity region","Gaussian interference channels","sum-rate capacity","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["capacity","Gaussian noise","interference"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594985","abstract":"An outer bound on the capacity region of the two-user Gaussian interference channel is derived.

For example, the ML redundancy of a Simplex code of length n is shown to be no greater than (n\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n - 4n + 9)/6.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Iterative decoding","Decoding","Upper bound","Kernel","Distance measurement","Binary codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","graph theory","maximum likelihood decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maximum likelihood redundancy","parity-check matrix","message-passing decoder","Tanner graph","erasure channel","q-ary code","dual code"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594992","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594992","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04594992.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594992","startPage":"280","endPage":"284","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On ML redundancy of codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On ML redundancy of codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594992/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4594992/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156276","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On ML redundancy of codes","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000280.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05839S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4594992","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4594993,"authors":[{"name":"Satish Babu Korada","affiliation":["School of Computer & Communication Sciences, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Satish Babu","lastName":"Korada","id":"37393186000"},{"name":"Rudiger Urbanke","affiliation":["School of Computer & Communication Sciences, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Rudiger","lastName":"Urbanke","id":"37283327000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4594993","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":129},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error probability","Noise","Evolution (biology)","Iterative decoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","channel coding","error statistics","iterative decoding","memoryless systems","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channel","low-density parity-check code","message passing decoding","density evolution threshold","maximum channel parameter","bit error probability"]}],"abstract":"We consider communication over a family of binary-input memoryless output-symmetric channels using low-density parity-check codes under message passing decoding. The asymptotic (in the length) performance of such a combination for a fixed number of iterations is given by density evolution. It is customary to define the threshold of density evolution as the maximum channel parameter for which the bit error probability under density evolution converges to zero as a function of the iteration number. In practice we often work with short codes and perform a large number of iterations. It is therefore interesting to consider what happens if in the standard analysis we exchange the order in which the blocklength and the number of iterations diverge to infinity. In particular, we can ask whether both limits give the same threshold. Although empirical observations strongly suggest that the exchange of limits is valid for all channel parameters, we limit our discussion to channel parameters below the density evolution threshold. Specifically, we show that under some suitable technical conditions the bit error probability vanishes below the density evolution threshold regardless of how the limit is taken.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594993","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04594993.pdf","startPage":"285","endPage":"289","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594993","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exchange of limits: Why iterative decoding works","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594993","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594993/","displayDocTitle":"Exchange of limits: Why iterative decoding works","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156277","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4594993/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exchange of limits: Why iterative decoding works","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000285.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045637S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4594993","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4594994,"authors":[{"name":"Nandakishore Santhi","affiliation":["Theoretical Division, CCS Division and the Center, Los Alamos, NM, USA"],"firstName":"Nandakishore","lastName":"Santhi","id":"37283022400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4594994","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":131},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maximum likelihood decoding","Parity check codes","Linear code","Polynomials","Vectors","Transforms","Construction industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary codes","computational complexity","linear codes","maximum likelihood decoding","parity check codes","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sparse representations","decoding LDPC codes","maximum likelihood decoding","NP-hard","binary linear codes","belief propagation decoding","polynomial time reduction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594994","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04594994.pdf","startPage":"290","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594994","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse representations for codes and the hardness of decoding LDPC codes","abstract":"The maximum likelihood decoding problem is known to be NP-hard for binary linear codes, while belief propagation decoding is known to work well in practice for several LDPC codes.

These codes can be considered as a generalization of classical serial turbo-codes. As their classical cousins, they can be iteratively decoded and with well chosen constituent convolutional codes, we observe an important reduction of the word error rate as the number of encoded qubits increases. Our construction offers several advantages over quantum LDPC codes. First, the Tanner graph used for decoding can be chosen to be free of 4-cycles that deteriorate the performances of iterative decoding. Secondly, the iterative decoder makes explicit use of the code's degeneracy. Finally, there is complete freedom in the code design in terms of length, rate, memory size, and interleaver choice. We address two issues related to the encoding of convolutional codes that are directly relevant for turbo-codes, namely the character of being recursive and non-catastrophic. We define a quantum analogue of a state diagram that provides an efficient way to verify these properties on a given quantum convolutional encoder. Unfortunately, we also prove that all recursive quantum convolutional encoder have catastrophic error propagation. In our constructions, the convolutional codes have thus been chosen to be non-catastrophic and non-recursive. While the resulting families of turbo-codes have bounded minimum distance, from a pragmatic point of view the effective minimum distances of the codes that we have simulated are large enough for not degrading iterative decoding performance up to reasonable word error rates and block sizes.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4594998","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Convolutional codes","Turbo codes","Distance measurement","Encoding","Iterative decoding","Parity check codes","Construction industry"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes","quantum theory","telecommunication channels","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["quantum serial turbo-code","depolarization channel","classical serial turbo-codes","convolutional codes","quantum LDPC codes","Tanner graph","iterative decoding","quantum convolutional encoder","catastrophic error propagation"]}],"publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04594998.pdf","startPage":"310","endPage":"314","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594998","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4594998","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum serial turbo-codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4594998/","displayDocTitle":"Quantum serial turbo-codes","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156303","htmlLink":"/document/4594998/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum serial turbo-codes","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090594S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4594998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595010,"authors":[{"name":"Salah A.

Two distinct network models, namely the interference channel with confidential messages and the one with an external eavesdropper, are analyzed. Using interference alignment along with secrecy pre-coding at each transmitter, it is shown that each user in the network can achieve non-zero secure degrees of freedoms (DoFs) in both scenarios. In particular, the proposed coding scheme achieves K-2/2K-2 secure DoFs for each user in the interference channel with confidential messages model, and K-2/2K secure DoFs in the case of an external eavesdropper. The fundamental difference between the two scenarios stems from the lack of channel state information (CSI) about the external eavesdropper. Remarkably, the results establish the positive impact of interference on the secrecy capacity of wireless networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595013.pdf","startPage":"384","endPage":"388","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595013","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595013","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the secure degrees of freedom in the K-user Gaussian interference channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Interference","Transmitters","Interference channels","Time frequency analysis","Indexes","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","encoding","Gaussian channels","interference suppression","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["K-user Gaussian interference channel","secrecy constraints","confidential messages","external eavesdropper","interference alignment","secrecy precoding","nonzero secure degrees of freedoms","coding scheme","channel state information","wireless networks"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595013/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the secure degrees of freedom in the K-user Gaussian interference channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595013/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156318","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the secure degrees of freedom in the K-user Gaussian interference channel","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000384.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049741S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595013","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595014,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaojun Tang","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"lastName":"Xiaojun Tang","id":"37292493700"},{"name":"Ruoheng Liu","affiliation":["Princeton University, USA"],"lastName":"Ruoheng Liu","id":"37401291300"},{"name":"Predrag Spasojevic","affiliation":["Rutgers University, USA"],"firstName":"Predrag","lastName":"Spasojevic","id":"37282992100"},{"name":"H.

This paper describes how eavesdropping can potentially be defeated by exploiting the superposition nature of the wireless medium. A Gaussian wire-tap channel with a helping interferer (WTC-HI) is considered in which a transmitter sends confidential messages to its intended receiver in the presence of a passive eavesdropper and with the help of an interferer. The interferer, which does not know the confidential message assists the confidential message transmission by sending a signal that is independent of the transmitted message. An achievable secrecy rate and a Sato-type upper bound on the secrecy capacity are given for the Gaussian WTC-HI. Through numerical analysis, it is found that the upper bound is close to the achievable secrecy rate when the interference is weak for symmetric interference channels, and under more general conditions for asymmetric Gaussian interference channels.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595014","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595014.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","startPage":"389","endPage":"393","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Gaussian wiretap channel with a helping interferer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595014","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The Gaussian wiretap channel with a helping interferer","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595014/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156319","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595014/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Gaussian wiretap channel with a helping interferer","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000389.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052636S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595014","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595018,"authors":[{"name":"Ravi Narasimhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ravi","lastName":"Narasimhan","id":"37269577300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595018","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Protocols","Gain","Signal to noise ratio","Probability","Delay","Steady-state"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","multi-access systems","probability","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delay-limited throughput","cooperative multiple access channels","hybrid-ARQ","quasi-static multiple access channel","hybrid-automatic repeat request","user cooperation","incremental redundancy HARQ packet transmission","packet delay constraint","individual outage probability","packet error probability","cooperative protocol","quality-of-service constraints"]}],"abstract":"This paper considers a two-user, quasi-static multiple access channel with hybrid-automatic repeat request (HARQ) and user cooperation. The protocol uses incremental redundancy HARQ packet transmission from both users until at least one userpsilas packet is successfully decoded. If one userpsilas packet is successful before the other, the successful user begins to act as a relay for the other user until packet success or until a maximum number of HARQ rounds L, where L represents the packet delay constraint. The performance of this cooperative multiple access channel is evaluated using the delay-limited throughput, defined as a measure of the throughput of an arbitrary packet, as well as the conventional long-term average throughput. The throughput metrics depend on each userpsilas individual outage probability, which is approximately equal to the userpsilas packet error probability as a function of the number of HARQ rounds. Compared to no user cooperation, this cooperative protocol provides significantly higher throughputs, with increasing gains for more stringent quality-of-service (QoS) constraints.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595018","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595018.pdf","startPage":"409","endPage":"413","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595018","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Delay-limited throughput of cooperative multiple access channels with hybrid-ARQ","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595018","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595018/","displayDocTitle":"Delay-limited throughput of cooperative multiple access channels with hybrid-ARQ","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156344","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595018/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Delay-limited throughput of cooperative multiple access channels with hybrid-ARQ","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000409.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039009S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595018","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595020,"authors":[{"name":"En-hui Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ONT, Canada"],"lastName":"En-hui Yang","id":"37272530400"},{"name":"Da-ke He","affiliation":["IBM Thomas J.

The method is based on efficient enumeration of input vectors with small distances to a reference vector whose elements are selected to be the most reliable values from the input alphabet. Several techniques, including modified cycle enumeration, are employed to reduce the complexity of the enumeration. The error rate estimate is derived by testing the input vectors of small distances and estimating the contribution of larger distance vectors. We demonstrate by a number of examples that the proposed method provides accurate estimates of error rate with computational complexity much lower than that of Monte Carlo simulations, especially at the error floor region.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595024/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10156350","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595024/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Error rate estimation of finite-length low-density parity-check codes decoded by soft-decision iterative algorithms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error rate estimation of finite-length low-density parity-check codes decoded by soft-decision iterative algorithms","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000439.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057884S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595024","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4595025,"authors":[{"name":"Pamela Lee","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Pamela","lastName":"Lee","id":"37401304400"},{"name":"Lara Dolecek","affiliation":["EECS Department, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Lara","lastName":"Dolecek","id":"37295938100"},{"name":"Zhengya Zhang","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Zhengya Zhang","id":"37292206800"},{"name":"Venkat Anantharam","affiliation":["EECS Department, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Venkat","lastName":"Anantharam","id":"37283320500"},{"name":"Borivoje","affiliation":["EECS Department University of California, Berkeley, 94720, USA"],"lastName":"Borivoje"},{"name":"Martin J.

Furthermore, we find that the spectral efficiency of MMSE detection grows discontinuously with the length of pilot sequences for large system loads, and that the critical length is close to the optimal length. While it is indistinguishable from that of LMMSE detection for short pilot sequences, the gap between the two is significantly large if the length of pilot sequences is longer than the critical length.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Replica analysis of general multiuser detection in MIMO DS-CDMA channels with imperfect CSI","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595039","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595039.pdf","startPage":"514","endPage":"518","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595039","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595039","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595039/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Replica analysis of general multiuser detection in MIMO DS-CDMA channels with imperfect CSI","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595039/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156384","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Replica analysis of general multiuser detection in MIMO DS-CDMA channels with imperfect CSI","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000514.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.121715S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595039","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595040,"authors":[{"name":"Kazutaka Nakamura","affiliation":["Department of Systems Science, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Kazutaka Nakamura","id":"37931119300"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Tanaka","affiliation":["Department of Systems Science, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Toshiyuki Tanaka","id":"37277531900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595040","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":42},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Detectors","Microscopy","Mathematical model","Multiaccess communication","Analytical models","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear vector channel","decoupling principle","CDMA","MIMO","scalar-channel characterization","Gaussian channels"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies decoupling principle of a linear vector channel, which is an extension of CDMA and MIMO channels.

A two- source, two-receiver network with the relay is considered. The focus is on the scenario in which, due to channel conditions, the relay can observe the signal from only one source. The relay can thus help the intended receiver of this message, via message forwarding, to decode it. In addition, the relay can simultaneously help the unintended receiver subtract the interference associated with this message. We call the latter strategy interference forwarding. An achievable rate region employing decode-and-forward (that simultaneously does message and interference forwarding) at the relay is derived and analyzed. This strategy is shown to achieve the capacity region under certain conditions. Our results demonstrate that the relay can help both receivers, despite the fact that it forwards only the message intended for one of them. This applies in general to communications in the presence of an interferer transmitting at any arbitrary rate. Interference forwarding improves reception of interfering signals at the receivers. This facilitates decoding of the unwanted messages and eliminating the resulting interference. Therefore, in networks with multiple source-destination pairs, in addition to relaying messages, interference forwarding may also be employed to help in combating interference.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595047","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595047.pdf","startPage":"554","endPage":"558","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595047","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the capacity of the interference channel with a relay","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595047","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595047/","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity of the interference channel with a relay","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156392","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595047/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity of the interference channel with a relay","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000554.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056662S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595047","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595048,"authors":[{"name":"Minqi Shen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"lastName":"Minqi Shen","id":"37850361200"},{"name":"Anders Host-Madsen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"firstName":"Anders","lastName":"Host-Madsen","id":"37284887100"},{"name":"Josep Vidal","affiliation":["Department of Signal Theory and Communications, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Josep","lastName":"Vidal","id":"37273645500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595048","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":515},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Transmitters","Fading","Interference channels","Gain"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","channel coding","frequency selective surfaces","multiplexing","multiuser channels","precoding","radiofrequency interference","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency selective channels","K-user interference channel","single antenna","zero forcing","pre-coding methods","Cadambe-Jafar interference alignment scheme","degree-of-freedom","multiplexing gain","wireless channel"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the achievable rate of a K-user interference channel with single antenna at individual node is studied.

For such design problems, perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI) at both the transmitter and the receiver is usually required. However, in the wireless communications environment, it is often difficult to provide sufficiently timely and accurate feedback of CSI from the receiver to the transmitter for such designs to be practically viable. In this paper, we consider the optimum design of a precoder for a wireless communication link having M transmitter antennas and N receiver antennas (M < N), in which the channels are assumed to be flat fading and may be correlated. We assume that full knowledge of CSI is available at the receiver. At the transmitter however, only the second order statistics of the channels are available. Our goal here is to come up with an efficient design of the optimal precoder for such a MIMO system by minimizing the average arithmetic mean-squared error (MSE) of zero-forcing (ZF) decision feedback detection subject to a constraint on the total transmitting power. Applying some of the properties of the matrix parameters, this non-convex optimization problem can be transformed into a convex geometrical programming problem which can then be efficiently solved using an interior point method. The superior performance of our MIMO system equipped with the optimum precoder is verified by computer simulations.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595051","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595051.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595051","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","startPage":"574","endPage":"578","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal precoder design for correlated MIMO systems using decision feedback receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595051","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal precoder design for correlated MIMO systems using decision feedback receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595051/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156396","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595051/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal precoder design for correlated MIMO systems using decision feedback receivers","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067869S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595051","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595052,"authors":[{"name":"Chih-Cheng Kuo","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chih-Cheng Kuo","id":"37292175900"},{"name":"Wern-Ho Sheen","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Wern-Ho Sheen","id":"37277915500"},{"name":"Chang-Lung Hsiao","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chang-Lung Hsiao","id":"37289136400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595052","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Complexity theory","Transforms","MIMO","Optimized production technology","Lattices","Artificial neural networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MMSE channel factorization","minimum mean square error methods","maximum-likelihood detection","MIMO signals","multiple-input multiple-output signals","channel factorization-aided detection","low-complexity signal detection","channel factorization-aided detector","lattice-reduction-aided detector","LRAD","Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz algorithm","LLL","Seysen lattice-basis reduction algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","ML detection","channel factorization-aided detectors","minimum mean square error"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates channel factorization-aided detection for MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) spatial multiplexing signals. In essence, this technique transforms, through channel factorization, the MIMO system into an equivalent one with a better-conditioned channel that is more suitable for low-complexity detection. The detected signal in the transform domain is then transformed back to the original domain and decision is made to the transmitted signal. Channel factorization-aided detector has recently become of great interest for MIMO systems because of its ability to cope with noise enhancement incurred by an ill-conditioned channel. Lattice-reduction-aided detector (LRAD) is such an example, where channel factorization is done with the Lenstra-Lenstra-Lovasz (LLL) or Seysen lattice-basis reduction algorithm. In this paper, a new minimum mean square error (MMSE)-based channel factorization is proposed. By minimizing mean square error in the transform domain, the proposed method can approach nearly to the performance of maximum likelihood detection and outperform the LLL factorization by up to 0.5 dB, depending on the types of used low-complexity detectors and/or antennas numbers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MMSE channel factorization for near maximum-likelihood detection of MIMO signals","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595052","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595052.pdf","startPage":"579","endPage":"583","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595052","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595052","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595052/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"MMSE channel factorization for near maximum-likelihood detection of MIMO signals","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595052/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156397","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MMSE channel factorization for near maximum-likelihood detection of MIMO signals","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000579.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066466S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595052","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595053,"authors":[{"name":"Rafael F.

The terminals are then allowed to communicate with each other, possibly interactively in many rounds and without rate restrictions, over a noiseless two-way public channel. Randomization is permitted at each terminal. The goal is for the terminals to generate a SK comprising discrete common randomness which is concealed from an eavesdropper that has access to the public interterminal communication. We establish that this maximum rate of SK generation, i.e., SK capacity, is, as expected, the per-symbol mutual information I of the correlated sources. Our main technical contribution is a new scheme for achieving SK capacity using structured codes. In our scheme, vector quantization at rate R nats/source symbol of the source at terminal 1 is performed by employing nested lattice codes with dithering. Then, a SK is generated by the terminals from the quantized random sequence at terminal 1 and the (unquantized) Gaussian source at terminal 2, using both lossy and lossless data compression techniques. Our algorithm, using a rate-R lattice quantizer, achieves a maximum SK rate of 1/2 log 1/(e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2I</sup>\n+(1-e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2I</sup>\n)e\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-2R</sup>\n), which tends to the SK capacity I with increasing R. Thus, our result also specifies the associated tradeoff between quantization rate R and the maximum achievable SK rate. This tradeoff is shown to be optimum among a certain restricted class of schemes for SK generation that involve quantization at rate R of a Gaussian source at one terminal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Secret key generation for correlated Gaussian sources","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595077","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595077.pdf","startPage":"702","endPage":"706","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595077","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595077","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595077/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Secret key generation for correlated Gaussian sources","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595077/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10159835","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret key generation for correlated Gaussian sources","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000702.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10494S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4595078,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Lei Zhao","id":"37087454031"},{"name":"Haim Permuter","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Haim","lastName":"Permuter","id":"37063917800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595078","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":45},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Dynamic programming","Power capacitors","Channel capacity","Decoding","Transmitters","Chemicals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","dynamic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["zero-error capacity","finite state channels","feedback","channel state information","transmitter","receiver","dynamic programming problem"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we study the zero-error capacity for finite state channel with feedback when channel state information is known to both the transmitter and the receiver.

First, based on numerous observations, a conjecture is stated that when the belief propagation decoder converges on a set of equal-capacity channels, it would also converge on any convex combination of those channels. Then, it is proved that when the stability condition is satisfied for a number of channels, it is also satisfied for any channel in their convex hull. For the purpose of code design, a method is proposed which can decompose every symmetric channel with capacity C into a set of identical-capacity basis channels. We expect codes that work on the basis channels to be suitable for any channel with capacity C. Such codes are found and in comparison with existing LDPC codes that are designed for specific channels, our codes obtain considerable coding gains when used across a multitude of channels.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595097","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595097.pdf","startPage":"802","endPage":"806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595097","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the design of universal LDPC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595097","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the design of universal LDPC codes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595097/","publicationDate":"July 2008","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10156476","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595097/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the design of universal LDPC codes","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054451S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595097","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4595098,"authors":[{"name":"Hossein Bahramgiri","affiliation":["Wireless Multimedia Communications Laboratory, School of ECE, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Hossein","lastName":"Bahramgiri","id":"37670392200"},{"name":"Farshad Lahouti","affiliation":["Wireless Multimedia Communications Laboratory, School of ECE, College of Engineering, University of Tehran, Iran"],"firstName":"Farshad","lastName":"Lahouti","id":"37284780900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595098","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595098","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Receivers","Maximum likelihood decoding","Error correction","Encoding","Error correction codes","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error statistics","maximum likelihood decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["syndrome-based maximum likelihood decoding","BNEC","block network error control codes","three-stage syndrome","error detection","bounded-distance decoding","probability","Singleton bound"]}],"abstract":"The block network error control coding, BNEC, is presented to combat error and erasure for multicast in directed acyclic networks.

In contrast with previous schemes which assume a constant channel during the cooperative frame (several slots), here, we relax this constraint and assume a classical quasi-static block-fading channel (constant for one slot). This additional degree of freedom modifies the behavior of the conventional non-orthogonal (NAF) schemes and generates a new block-fading NAF (BFNAF) protocol where the source can usefully retransmit the same data during the cooperative slot. This new protocol is interesting at low spectral efficiencies where diversity against fading is more important. Another issue which is discussed throughout the paper is the optimal power allocation of the investigated schemes. The proposed power allocation strategy uses as an optimization criterion well-defined asymptotic expressions of the outage probabilities, averaged over the fading statistics.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595105","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595105","startPage":"842","endPage":"846","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595105.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward for block-fading channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Non-orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward for block-fading channels","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595105/","accessionNumber":"10156505","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595105/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-orthogonal Amplify-and-Forward for block-fading channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000842.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054932S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595105","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595106,"authors":[{"name":"Ankit Gupta","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Ankit","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37309188500"},{"name":"Sergio Verdu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Sergio","lastName":"Verdu","id":"37274351500"},{"name":"Tsachy Weissman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel","Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Tsachy","lastName":"Weissman","id":"37283290800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595106","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":113},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Complexity theory","Decoding","Rate-distortion","Construction industry","Electrical engineering","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","data compression","decoding","linear codes","memoryless systems","rate distortion theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["rate-distortion function","computational complexity","lossy compression","memoryless source","decoding complexity","encoding complexity","arbitrary nondecreasing unbounded function","ergodic source"]}],"abstract":"We present two results related to the computational complexity of lossy compression.

In this paper, we show that the posterior matching scheme achieves the mutual information for a large family of channels and input distributions, and provide closed-form expressions for the attainable error probability over a range of rates. Moreover, we derive the achievable rates in a mismatched setting, where the scheme is designed according to the wrong channel model. In particular, our results hold for discrete memoryless channels, thereby confirming a longstanding conjecture that the Horstein scheme achieves capacity. The proof techniques employed utilize novel relations between information rates and convergence properties of iterated function systems.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595117","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","startPage":"900","endPage":"904","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595117","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595117.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probability density function","Decoding","AWGN","Error probability","Mutual information","Delta modulation","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","error statistics","iterative methods","maximum likelihood estimation","pattern matching","sequential codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["posterior matching feedback scheme","error analysis","Horstein schemes","Schalkwijk-Kailath schemes","sequential communication scheme","general memoryless channels","closed-form expressions","error probability","iterated function systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The posterior matching feedback scheme: Capacity achieving and error analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595117/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595117/","accessionNumber":"10156517","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The posterior matching feedback scheme: Capacity achieving and error analysis","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000900.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057752S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595117","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4595118,"authors":[{"name":"Ekine Akuiyibo","affiliation":["Packard Electrical Engineering Building, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ekine","lastName":"Akuiyibo","id":"37546434800"},{"name":"Olivier Leveque","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Olivier","lastName":"Leveque","id":"37283975200"},{"name":"Christophe Vignat","affiliation":["Institut Gaspard Monge, Universit\u00e9 de Marne la Vallee, Marne la Vallee, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Vignat","id":"37300087400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595118","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":17,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":124},"abstract":"The rate region achievable by two transmitter-receiver pairs who wish to communicate over a Gaussian interference channel has been the subject of intense study over the last decades.

The source operates each of the transmit antennas via finite-capacity links, and likewise the destination is connected to the receiving antennas through capacity-constrained channels. Targeting a nomadic communication scenario, in which the distributed MIMO transceiver is designed to serve different standards or services, transmitters and receivers are assumed to be oblivious to the encoding functions shared by source and destination. Adopting a Gaussian symmetric interference network as the channel model (as for regularly placed transmitters and receivers), achievable rates are investigated and compared with an upper bound.

As a byproduct, on the conceptual level, we find an interesting relation between the DM tradeoff framework and the notion of dominant error event regions which was first introduced in the AWGN case by Gallager, IEEE Trans. IT, 1985. This relation allows to accurately characterize the error mechanisms in MIMO fading multiple-access channels. In particular, we find that, for a given rate tuple, the maximum achievable diversity order is determined by the error event that dominates the total error probability exponentially in SNR. Finally, we show that the distributed space-time code construction proposed recently by Badr and Belfiore, Int. Zurich Seminar on Commun., 2008, satisfies the code design criteria derived in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595120.pdf","startPage":"915","endPage":"919","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595120","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595120","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595120","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in selective-fading multiple-access MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Delta modulation","MIMO","Fading","Receiving antennas","Transmitting antennas","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","error statistics","fading channels","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multiplexing","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","selective-fading multiple-access MIMO channels","multiple-input multiple-output channels","code design criteria","maximum achievable diversity order","error probability","distributed space-time code construction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595120/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in selective-fading multiple-access MIMO channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595120/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156540","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff in selective-fading multiple-access MIMO channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000915.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.13294S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595120","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595121,"authors":[{"name":"Xiao Li","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiao Li","id":"37406895300"},{"name":"Shi Jin","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China","University College London, UK"],"lastName":"Shi Jin","id":"37290425400"},{"name":"Xiqi Gao","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, South-East University, Nanjing, China"],"lastName":"Xiqi Gao","id":"37277462600"},{"name":"Matthew R.

The inner encoder is optimized in order to guarantee the best tradeoff between error floor and threshold.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595127.pdf","startPage":"950","endPage":"954","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595127","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595127","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-binary decoding of structured LDPC codes: Density evolution","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Evolution (biology)","Encoding","Equations","Algorithm design and analysis","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative decoding","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC codes","serial turbo codes","low-density parity-check codes","nonbinary iterative decoding algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595127/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Non-binary decoding of structured LDPC codes: Density evolution","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595127/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156547","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-binary decoding of structured LDPC codes: Density evolution","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0000950.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039363S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595127","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595128,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian Voicila","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Adrian","lastName":"Voicila","id":"37078732900"},{"name":"David Declercq","affiliation":["UCP CNRS UMR, ETIS ENSEA, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Declercq","id":"37269103100"},{"name":"Francois Verdier","affiliation":["UCP CNRS UMR, ETIS ENSEA, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Francois","lastName":"Verdier","id":"37393902000"},{"name":"Marc Fossorier","affiliation":["UCP CNRS UMR, ETIS ENSEA, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Fossorier","id":"37274927600"},{"name":"Pascal Urard","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Crolles, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Urard","id":"37394509500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595128","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":212},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Memory management","Sparse matrices","Bipartite graph","Construction industry","Iterative decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["split non-binary LDPC codes","error correcting codes","iterative decoding","binary-input noisy channel"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose and study a new family of error-correcting codes.

The terminals are then allowed to communicate interactively in multiple rounds over a public noiseless channel of unlimited capacity, with all such communication being observed by all the terminals. The objective is to generate a secret key shared by a given subset of terminals at the largest rate possible. All the terminals cooperate in generating the secret key, with secrecy being required from an eavesdropper which has access to the public interterminal communication. We provide a (single-letter) formula for the secrecy capacity for this model, and show a natural connection between the problem of secret key generation and the combinatorial problem of maximal packing of Steiner trees in an associated multigraph. In particular, we show that the maximum number of Steiner tree packings in the multigraph is always a lower bound for the secrecy capacity. The bound is tight for the case when all the terminals seek to share a secret key; the mentioned connection yields an explicit capacity-achieving algorithm. This algorithm, which can be executed in polynomial time, extracts a group-wide secret key of the optimum rate from the collection of optimum and mutually independent secret keys for pairs of terminals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595140/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10156577","publicationDate":"July 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595140/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Secret key generation for a pairwise independent network model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Secret key generation for a pairwise independent network model","confLoc":"Toronto, ON","sourcePdf":"0001015.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06822S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595140","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-16"},{"_id":4595143,"authors":[{"name":"David G.

When used in conjunction with successive decoding, the MIMO channel is converted into a set of AWGN scalar channels, allowing for standard coding and decoding techniques to be employed. By superimposing multiple layers of orthogonal-design codes, the well known drawback of loss of degrees of freedom of the latter is alleviated. When used in a closed-loop mode, the scheme allows to approach the white-input capacity of a MIMO channel with limited feedback, i.e., with feedback of the eigenvalues of the channel matrix. When used in an open-loop mode, the scheme exhibits good performance in terms of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. Further, the computational complexity is linear in the transmission rate.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595150.pdf","startPage":"1063","endPage":"1067","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595150","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595150","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595150","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-layer SISO coding for MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Modulation","Noise","Receivers","Transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","block codes","channel capacity","communication complexity","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","matrix algebra","MIMO communication","orthogonal codes","space-time codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multilayer SISO coding","MIMO channels","dithered orthogonal design space-time block codes","AWGN scalar channels","orthogonal-design codes","white-input capacity","eigenvalues","channel matrix","open-loop mode","diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","computational complexity"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595150/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Multi-layer SISO coding for MIMO channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595150/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156587","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-layer SISO coding for MIMO channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037926S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595150","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595152,"authors":[{"name":"Jean Creignou","affiliation":["IMB, Universite Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Jean","lastName":"Creignou","id":"38094558300"},{"name":"Herve Diet","affiliation":["IMB, Universite Bordeaux 1, Talence, France"],"firstName":"Herve","lastName":"Diet","id":"38094558200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595152","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":48},"abstract":"The linear programming method is applied to the space U\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</sub>\n(Copf) of unitary matrices in order to obtain bounds for codes relative to the diversity sum and the diversity product.

The MMSE can be regarded as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), as well as a functional or transform of the input distribution. This paper shows that the MMSE is analytic in SNR for every random variable. Simple expressions for the derivatives of the MMSE as a function of the SNR are obtained. Since the input-output mutual information can be written as the integral of the MMSE as a function of SNR, the results also lead to higher derivatives of the mutual information. The MMSE and mutual informationpsilas convexity in the SNR and concavity in the input distribution are established. It is shown that there can be only one SNR for which the MMSE of a Gaussian random variable and that of a non-Gaussian random variable coincide. Application of the properties of the MMSE to the scalar Gaussian broadcast channel problem is presented.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595154","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","startPage":"1083","endPage":"1087","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Estimation of non-Gaussian random variables in Gaussian noise: Properties of the MMSE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595154","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Estimation of non-Gaussian random variables in Gaussian noise: Properties of the MMSE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595154/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156591","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595154/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Estimation of non-Gaussian random variables in Gaussian noise: Properties of the MMSE","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081739S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595154","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595160,"authors":[{"name":"Hans-Andrea Loeliger","affiliation":["Department Information Technology & Electrical Engineering, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Hans-Andrea","lastName":"Loeliger","id":"37269552300"},{"name":"Mehdi Molkaraie","affiliation":["Department Information Technology & Electrical Engineering, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Molkaraie","id":"37283356500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595160","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595160","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computational modeling","Information rates","Monte Carlo methods","Convergence","Numerical models","Information theory","Junctions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intersymbol interference","Ising model","Monte Carlo methods","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulation-based estimation","partition function","information rate","graphical models","source model","channel model","cycle breaking subset","sum-product computations","two-dimensional Ising model","intersymbol interference channel"]}],"abstract":"Monte Carlo methods are considered to compute, first, the partition function of graphical models, and second, the information rate of source/channel models, in both cases for factor graphs with cycles.

It is also observed that when exceeding the capacity of the erasure channel, the performance of such codes exhibits graceful degradation as measured by the residual erasure fraction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595164/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595164/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156615","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Bounds on rates of LDPC codes for BEC with varying erasure rate","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounds on rates of LDPC codes for BEC with varying erasure rate","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001133.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068701S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595164","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4595166,"authors":[{"name":"Gokul Sridharan","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Gokul","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37994456900"},{"name":"Abishek Kumarasubramanian","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Abishek","lastName":"Kumarasubramanian","id":"38094577800"},{"name":"Andrew Thangaraj","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Thangaraj","id":"37324698100"},{"name":"Srikrishna Bhashyam","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, India"],"firstName":"Srikrishna","lastName":"Bhashyam","id":"37294831000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595166","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595166","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Simulated annealing","WiMAX","Optimization","Computational modeling","Iterative decoding","Magnetic recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic codes","error correction codes","iterative decoding","parity check codes","simulated annealing","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["burst erasure correction optimization","LDPC codes","iterative decoding","low density parity check codes","optimal permutation","combinatorial optimization problem","simulated annealing based approach","quasi-cyclic codes","WiMax standard"]}],"abstract":"The performance of iterative decoding of low density parity check (LDPC) codes over binary erasure channels can be completely characterized by the study of stopping sets. Therefore, the burst erasure correction capability of a given LDPC code can be readily quantified by searching for stopping sets within consecutive bit nodes. In this work we study the optimal permutation of the bit nodes that will result in the maximum possible burst erasure correction capability for a given LDPC code. Noting that this is essentially a combinatorial optimization problem that is highly likely to be NP-hard, we adopt a simulated annealing based approach for finding the optimal permutation. We present bounds based on stopping sets that limit the burst erasure correction capability. As part of our results, we provide interleavers that greatly improve the burst erasure correction capability of protograph quasi-cyclic LDPC codes used in the WiMax standard.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595166","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595166","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595166.pdf","startPage":"1143","endPage":"1147","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing burst erasure correction of LDPC codes by interleaving","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing burst erasure correction of LDPC codes by interleaving","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595166/","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156617","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595166/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing burst erasure correction of LDPC codes by interleaving","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001143.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050176S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595166","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4595167,"authors":[{"name":"Noam Presman","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Noam","lastName":"Presman","id":"37660780600"},{"name":"Eran Sharon","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Eran","lastName":"Sharon","id":"37283962000"},{"name":"Simon Litsyn","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Simon","lastName":"Litsyn","id":"37267257400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595167","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":13,"totalDownloads":199},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Schedules","Parity check codes","Probability density function","Floods","Convergence","Algorithm design and analysis","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","iterative decoding","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LDPC codes","iterative decoding","serial decoding","Tanner graph","lifted graphs","low density parity check code"]}],"abstract":"Efficient serial decoding schedules for LDPC codes are described.

The symmetric capacity I(W) is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel equiprobably and equals the capacity C(W) if the channel has certain symmetry properties. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of N independent copies of a given B-DMC W, a different set of N binary-input channels such that the capacities of the latter set, except for a negligible fraction of them, are either near 1 or near 0.

The classical information-theoretic approach neglects the energy expended in processing the data at the encoder and the decoder and only minimizes the energy required for transmissions. Since there is no cost associated with using more degrees of freedom, the traditionally optimal strategy is to communicate at rate zero. In this work, we use our recently proposed model for the power consumed by iterative message passing. Using generalized sphere-packing bounds on the decoding power, we find lower bounds on the total energy consumed in the transmissions and the decoding, allowing for freedom in the choice of the rate. We show that contrary to the classical intuition, the rate for green codes is bounded away from zero for any given error probability. In fact, as the desired bit-error probability goes to zero, the optimizing rate for our bounds converges to 1.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green codes: Energy-efficient short-range communication","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595173","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595173.pdf","startPage":"1178","endPage":"1182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595173","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595173/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Green codes: Energy-efficient short-range communication","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595173/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156623","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green codes: Energy-efficient short-range communication","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001178.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06711S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595173","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595178,"authors":[{"name":"J.

When both the users are equipped with the same code alphabet, it is shown that, rotation of one of the userpsilas alphabets by an appropriate angle can make the new pair of alphabets not only uniquely decodable, but will result in enlargement of the capacity region. For this set-up, we identify the primary problem to be finding appropriate angle(s) of rotation between the alphabets such that the capacity region is maximally enlarged. It is shown that the angle of rotation which provides maximum enlargement of the capacity region also minimizes the union bound on the probability of error of the sum-alphabet and vice-verse. The optimum angle(s) of rotation varies with the SNR. Through simulations, optimal angle(s) of rotation that gives maximum enlargement of the capacity region of GMAC with some well known alphabets such as M-QAM and M-PSK for some M are presented for several values of SNR. It is shown that for large number of points in the alphabets, capacity gains due to rotations progressively reduce. As the number of points N tends to infinity, our results match the results in the literature wherein the capacity region of the Gaussian code alphabet doesnpsilat change with rotation for any SNR.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595178.pdf","startPage":"1203","endPage":"1207","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595178","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite signal-set capacity of two-user Gaussian Multiple Access Channel","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Mutual information","Gain","Adders","Additive noise","Computational modeling","Distance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel coding","error statistics","Gaussian channels","multi-access systems","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite signal-set capacity","two-user Gaussian multiple access channel","GMAC","complex finite input alphabet","continuous output alphabet","error probability","Gaussian code alphabet"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595178/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Finite signal-set capacity of two-user Gaussian Multiple Access Channel","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595178/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156628","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite signal-set capacity of two-user Gaussian Multiple Access Channel","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046118S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595178","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595179,"authors":[{"name":"Jochen Sommerfeld","affiliation":["Heinrich Hertz Chair for Mobile Communications, Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Jochen","lastName":"Sommerfeld","id":"38096766500"},{"name":"Igor Bjelakovic","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Berlin, DE"],"firstName":"Igor","lastName":"Bjelakovic","id":"37713411200"},{"name":"Holger Boche","affiliation":["Technische Universitat Berlin, Berlin, Berlin, DE"],"firstName":"Holger","lastName":"Boche","id":"37276597900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595179","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":95},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Covariance matrix","Mutual information","MIMO","Power measurement","Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions","Finite element methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","fading channels","radiocommunication","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Rayleigh fading channels","wireless multiple antenna communication system","Rayleigh flat fading","channel state information"]}],"abstract":"We consider transmission over a wireless multiple antenna communication system operating in a Rayleigh flat fading environment with no channel state information at the receiver and the transmitter.

We first provide a proof of our recent conjecture on the optimality of a discrete input distribution in this scenario. Specifically, we show that for any given output quantizer choice with K quantization bins (i.e., a precision of log\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\n K bits), the input distribution, under an average power constraint, need not have any more than K + 1 mass points to achieve the channel capacity. The cutting-plane algorithm is employed to compute this capacity and to generate optimum input distributions. Numerical optimization over the choice of the quantizer is then performed (for 2-bit and 3-bit symmetric quantization), and the results we obtain show that the loss due to low-precision output quantization, which is small at low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as expected, can be quite acceptable even for moderate to high SNR values. For example, at SNRs up to 20 dB, 2-3 bit quantization achieves 80-90% of the capacity achievable using infinite-precision quantization.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity of the discrete-time AWGN channel under output quantization","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595181","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595181.pdf","startPage":"1218","endPage":"1222","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595181","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595181","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595181/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capacity of the discrete-time AWGN channel under output quantization","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595181/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156598","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity of the discrete-time AWGN channel under output quantization","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060786S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595181","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595183,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Hu","affiliation":["QUALCOMM, Inc.orporated, San Diego, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Hu","id":"37403956500"},{"name":"Tolga M.

It is seen that the optimal power allocation follows a multi-level waterfilling structure.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595184","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595184.pdf","endPage":"1237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation in Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595184","startPage":"1233","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595184","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation in Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595184/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10156601","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595184/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Likelihood Channel Estimation in Decode-and-Forward Relay Networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001233.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074703S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595184","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595186,"authors":[{"name":"Gilad Bukai","affiliation":["Gzeht Investments, Tel-Aviv, Israel"],"firstName":"Gilad","lastName":"Bukai","id":"38094581300"},{"name":"Neri Merhav","affiliation":["Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel"],"firstName":"Neri","lastName":"Merhav","id":"37267255000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595186","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":61},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","Equations","Estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Receivers","Training","Transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel estimation","feedback","information theory","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","feedback","memoryless channel","channel capacity","Cramer-Rao bound","channel parameter estimator","radio receiver","information theory"]}],"abstract":"It is well known from the information theory literature that in the presence of a memoryless channel, as well as some channels with memory, the existence of feedback does not improve channel capacity, but can contribute dramatically to the simplification of the encoder and the decoder. In this paper, we focus on estimating the parameters of an unknown channel when a feedback link from the decoder to the encoder is given. We examine different types of channels and study the conditions under which feedback improves the estimation in the sense of the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We additionally find what is the best strategy for designing channel input signals and the channel parameter estimator of the receiver. By assuming a certain class of parametric models for the channel, we show that feedback is essential when some nuisance parameters of the model are unknown, but it is superfluous when there are no unknown nuisance parameters.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595186","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595186.pdf","endPage":"1247","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel estimation using feedback","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595186","startPage":"1243","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595186","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Channel estimation using feedback","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595186/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10156603","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595186/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel estimation using feedback","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001243.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062659S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595186","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595187,"authors":[{"name":"Hidetoshi Saito","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communications Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Kogakuin University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Hidetoshi Saito","id":"37088050864"},{"name":"Masayuki Hayashi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Division of Physics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Masayuki Hayashi","id":"37088049302"},{"name":"Ryuji Kohno","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, Division of Physics, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Yokohama National University, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Ryuji Kohno","id":"37087387007"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595187","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":46},"abstract":"A number of multitrack recording systems with multiple-head arrays have been developed for the future high density magnetic recoding systems. In this recording system, the signal detection scheme is needed to estimate the received sequence with media noise, intersymbol interference and inter-track interference. From the recent trend of high density magnetic recording, it is indispensable for any signal processing scheme to mitigate or reduce the effect of media noise such as mixture signal-dependent transition noise and colored Gaussian thermal noise. This paper proposes the statistical inference using the cointegrated process based on vector autoregressive (VAR) models for such a finite mixture of known number of noise and interference components. Our signal detection scheme is applied to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection with the cointegrated VAR processes. Furthermore, a high rate low-density parity-check (LDPC) code is used for the error correcting code which satisfies the specific run-length limited condition in the proposed multitrack recording system. We show that the proposed multi-track system of error correcting and signal detection scheme is effective to estimate degraded signal sequences and improve the error rate performances with respect to the conventional multitrack system which has the LDPC coding scheme and MAP detector employing the BCJR algorithm.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Media","Magnetic recording","Reactive power","Interference","Matrix decomposition","Magnetic domains"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital magnetic recording","parity check codes","signal processing","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cointegrated vector autoregressive model","digital magnetic recording","multitrack recording systems","multiple-head arrays","high density magnetic recoding systems","signal processing","media noise reduction","statistical inference","cointegrated process","maximum a posteriori detection","low-density parity-check code"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595187","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595187.pdf","startPage":"1248","endPage":"1252","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595187","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cointegrated vector autoregressive models for multitrack systems in digital magnetic recording","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595187","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Cointegrated vector autoregressive models for multitrack systems in digital magnetic recording","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595187/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595187/","accessionNumber":"10156604","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cointegrated vector autoregressive models for multitrack systems in digital magnetic recording","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001248.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07241S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595187","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4595190,"authors":[{"name":"Viveck R.

Thereby, in contrast to existing approaches, the code is arranged over a number of OFDM frames rather than over the carriers. Given the initial OFDM frames all linear combinations thereof are generated; from that the best are selected. The corresponding generator matrix is identical to that of the Simplex code. Specifically, we consider multi-antenna transmission, where the proposed scheme does not cause any additional delay, but utilize the dimension space adequately. The scheme is very flexible; due to the selection step any criterion of optimality can be taken into account. Performance is derived analytically and is covered by numerical results which are in very good agreement with theory.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595198","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595198.pdf","startPage":"1303","endPage":"1307","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595198","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM peak-to-average power ratio reduction based on the simplex code","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595198","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595198/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM peak-to-average power ratio reduction based on the simplex code","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156633","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595198/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM peak-to-average power ratio reduction based on the simplex code","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057441S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595198","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595199,"authors":[{"name":"Clemens Stierstorfer","affiliation":["Lehrstuhl fur Informationsubertragung, Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Stierstorfer","id":"37563798000"},{"name":"Robert F.H.

Numerical results show a performance in terms of the bit-error ratio comparable to established bit-loading algorithms.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate loading in OFDM based on bit-level capacities","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595199","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595199.pdf","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1312","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595199","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595199","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595199/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Rate loading in OFDM based on bit-level capacities","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595199/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156634","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate loading in OFDM based on bit-level capacities","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098192S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595199","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595202,"authors":[{"name":"Shengshan Cui","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, New Jersey Institute of Technology, Newark, NJ, USA"],"lastName":"Shengshan Cui","id":"37529526600"},{"name":"Alexander M.

Then, we use complex user-specific algebraic-phase scrambling sequences to distinguish users. The receiver is based on the iterative multiuser decoding suggested in [5,8]. Next, we design complex algebraic phase scrambling sequences to mitigate multiple access interferences for overloaded PS-CDMA, i.e., the number of users is greater than the spreading factor. By analyzing extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) curves and the trajectories, we demonstrate that PS-CDMA using the proposed scrambling sequences has faster iterative decoding convergency and better system performance, when compared to the PS-CDMA using random-phase scrambling sequences and some previously known multiple access schemes.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiuser detection","Iterative decoding","Convolutional codes","Trajectory","Receivers","Multiaccess communication","Decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","decoding","encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["algebraic-phase scrambling sequence","code-spread code-division multiple-access","Gaussian multiple access channel","iterative multiuser decoding","algebraic phase scrambling sequences","extrinsic information transfer"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595211","startPage":"1368","endPage":"1372","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595211.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595211","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Algebraic-phase scrambling sequences for code-spread code-division multiple-access","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Algebraic-phase scrambling sequences for code-spread code-division multiple-access","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10156645","publicationDate":"July 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595211/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595211/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Algebraic-phase scrambling sequences for code-spread code-division multiple-access","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001368.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044073S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595211","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4595212,"authors":[{"name":"Kouichiro Kitagawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Kouichiro Kitagawa","id":"38092675200"},{"name":"Toshiyuki Tanaka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University, Sakyo, Kyoto, Japan"],"lastName":"Toshiyuki Tanaka","id":"37277531900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595212","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":40},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial intelligence","Barium","Copper"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","correlation methods","Hilbert transforms","optimal systems","statistical mechanics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal spreading sequences","large CDMA systems","statistical mechanics approach","CDMA channels","correlation matrix","orthogonally invariant random Welch bound equality spreading sequences"]}],"abstract":"We discuss optimal spreading sequences for CDMA channels under assumption of an arbitrary data modulation.

Although a high percentage of the overloading factor degrades the system performance in noisy channels, simulation results show that this degradation is not significant.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Errorless codes for over-loaded synchronous CDMA systems and evaluation of channel capacity bounds","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595213","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595213.pdf","startPage":"1378","endPage":"1382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595213","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Errorless codes for over-loaded synchronous CDMA systems and evaluation of channel capacity bounds","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595213/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156647","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Errorless codes for over-loaded synchronous CDMA systems and evaluation of channel capacity bounds","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001378.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08154S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595216,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Cuff","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Cuff","id":"37860470800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595216","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":51,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":397},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Joints","Random variables","Mutual information","Memoryless systems","Program processors","Decoding","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication requirements","correlated random variables","discrete memoryless channel","Shannonpsilas mutual information"]}],"abstract":"Two familiar notions of correlation are re-discovered as extreme operating points for simulating a discrete memoryless channel, in which a channel output is generated based only on a description of the channel input.

The inner bound is based on a generalization of the multilayer scheme previously proposed by Puri et al., through a more flexible binning method. The resulting achievable region has the same geometric structure as the rate region of the lossless multilevel diversity coding problem, which reveals a strong connection between them. The outer bound is derived by combining the bounding technique for the sum rate in our earlier work, together with the alpha-resolution method introduced by Yeung and Zhang. Comparison between the inner and outer bounds shows that the gap in between is upper bounded by some constants. Particularly for the three description problem, the bounds can be written explicitly, and both the inner and outer bounds can be represented by ten planes with matching normal directions, between which the pairwise difference is small.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Approximating the Gaussian multiple description rate region under symmetric distortion constraints","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595220","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595220.pdf","startPage":"1413","endPage":"1417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595220","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595220","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595220/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Approximating the Gaussian multiple description rate region under symmetric distortion constraints","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595220/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156108","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Approximating the Gaussian multiple description rate region under symmetric distortion constraints","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001413.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052643S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595226,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremie Ezri","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jeremie","lastName":"Ezri","id":"37832319400"},{"name":"Andrea Montanari","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Statistics Departments, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Montanari","id":"37283172800"},{"name":"Sewoong Oh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Statistics Departments, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Sewoong","lastName":"Oh","id":"37404800500"},{"name":"Ruediger Urbanke","affiliation":["School of Computer and Communication Sciences, EPF Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ruediger","lastName":"Urbanke","id":"37283327000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595226","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Error probability","Evolution (biology)","Optimization","Computational modeling","Quantization","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","iterative decoding","optimisation","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["slope scaling parameter","scaling laws","iterative decoding","sparse graph codes","finite-length optimization","error probability","binary erasure channel","quantized message-passing decoders","low-density parity-check codes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595226","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595226.pdf","startPage":"1443","endPage":"1447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595226","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595226","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The slope scaling parameter for general channels, decoders, and ensembles","abstract":"Scaling laws are a powerful way to analyze the performance of moderately sized iteratively decoded sparse graph codes. Our aim is to provide an easily usable finite-length optimization tool that is applicable to the wide variety of channels, blocklengths, error probability requirements, and decoders that one encounters for practical systems. The tool is aimed at non-experts in the field, who need to quickly find code designs that are comparable with the best known codes available today but do not have the luxury of spending months in doing so. In previous work we have shown how to compute scaling parameters for transmission over the binary erasure channel, as well as general channels and general quantized message-passing decoders when applied to regular ensembles. In this paper we show how to compute the message variance for a fixed number of iterations for irregular low-density parity-check ensembles. From these calculations the basic scaling parameter alpha can be deduced by determining the leading term of the limiting expression when the number of iterations tends to infinity and the channel parameter approaches the density evolution threshold.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595226/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10156114","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595226/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"The slope scaling parameter for general channels, decoders, and ensembles","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The slope scaling parameter for general channels, decoders, and ensembles","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001443.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053779S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595226","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4595227,"authors":[{"name":"Jeremie Ezri","affiliation":["LTHC, EPF Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jeremie","lastName":"Ezri","id":"37832319400"},{"name":"Rudiger Urbanke","affiliation":["LTHC, EPF Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Rudiger","lastName":"Urbanke","id":"37283327000"},{"name":"Andrea Montanari","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, USA"],"firstName":"Andrea","lastName":"Montanari","id":"37283172800"},{"name":"Sewoong Oh","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of Stanford, USA"],"lastName":"Sewoong Oh","id":"37404800500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595227","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":54},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random variables","Decoding","Error probability","Noise level","Computational modeling","Evolution (biology)","Covariance matrix"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","message passing","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-density parity check codes","threshold shift computing","code ensemble","noise level","block error probability","binary erasure channel","finite-blocklength shift parameter","binary memoryless symmetric channels","message passing"]}],"abstract":"The dasiathresholdpsila of a code ensemble can be defined as the noise level at which the block error probability curve crosses 1/2.

Combined with previous results, that have shown that the LP decoder can correct some fixed fraction of errors, we conclude that this error correction can be achieved with linear computational complexity.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","startPage":"1498","endPage":"1502","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595237","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595237.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative approximate linear programming decoding of LDPC codes with linear complexity","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595237/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Iterative approximate linear programming decoding of LDPC codes with linear complexity","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156125","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595237/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative approximate linear programming decoding of LDPC codes with linear complexity","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001498.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045428S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595237","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595238,"authors":[{"name":"Mark F.

The bounds apply to peak-constrained inputs; they are explicit in the channelpsilas scattering function, are useful for a large range of bandwidth, and allow one to coarsely identify the capacity-optimal combination of bandwidth and number of transmit antennas. Furthermore, a closed-form expression is obtained for the first-order Taylor series expansion of capacity in the limit of infinite bandwidth. From this expression, it is concluded that in the wideband regime: (i) it is optimal to use only one transmit antenna when the channel is spatially uncorrelated; (ii) rank-one statistical beamforming is optimal if the channel is spatially correlated; and (iii) spatial correlation, be it at the transmitter, the receiver, or both, is beneficial.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595254.pdf","startPage":"1582","endPage":"1586","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595254","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595254","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity bounds for peak-constrained multiantenna wideband channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time frequency analysis","Receiving antennas","Scattering","Receivers","Approximation methods","Correlation","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband antennas","channel capacity","correlation methods","MIMO communication","statistical analysis","transmitting antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","peak-constrained multiantenna wideband channel","multiple-input multiple-output channel","spatial correlation","transmit antenna","first-order Taylor series expansion","infinite bandwidth","statistical beamforming"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595254/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Capacity bounds for peak-constrained multiantenna wideband channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595254/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156142","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity bounds for peak-constrained multiantenna wideband channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001582.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.120675S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595255,"authors":[{"name":"Ada Poon","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Ada","lastName":"Poon","id":"37269766800"},{"name":"David Tse","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Tse","id":"37274371600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595255","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":261},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Gain","Scattering","Dipole antennas","Antenna radiation patterns","Geometry","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","electromagnetic wave polarisation","electromagnetic wave scattering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["polarization degree of freedom","multiple-antenna channel","multiplicative gain","antenna array geometry","scattering condition"]}],"abstract":"This paper unifies the different conclusions on the polarization degrees of freedom in multiple-antenna channels.

Taking a general view of a sensor as any device whose observations depend statistically on target position, we consider the binary hypothesis testing problem of choosing between the correct target location and an incorrect location at a distance r from it, given the outputs of all sensors in the network. By considering a random placement of sensors in an infinitely large sensing area, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the error probability of this hypothesis testing problem. The error bounds depend only on the type of sensor and are independent of the detailed geometry of the sensor network deployment. This provides a compact comparison of the localization performance of sensors whose characteristics might differ widely (e.g., received signal strength, proximity and time of arrival sensors). Also the bounds decrease exponentially with the density of sensors, and the rate of decrease is shown to have a simple geometric interpretation.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595258","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595258.pdf","startPage":"1602","endPage":"1606","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595258","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information theoretic bounds for sensor network localization","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595258/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Information theoretic bounds for sensor network localization","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156146","htmlLink":"/document/4595258/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information theoretic bounds for sensor network localization","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001602.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05696S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595258","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595260,"authors":[{"name":"Lav R.

The algorithm has the feature that the encoding process is truly online, as opposed to a block-by-block approach. The setup assumes a packet erasure broadcast channel with stochastic arrivals and full feedback, but the proposed scheme is potentially applicable to more general lossy networks with link-by-link feedback. The algorithm guarantees that the physical queue size at the sender tracks the backlog in degrees of freedom (also called the virtual queue size). The new notion of a node ldquoseeingrdquo a packet is introduced. In terms of this idea, our algorithm may be viewed as a natural extension of ARQ schemes to coded networks. Our approach, known as the drop-when-seen algorithm, is compared with a baseline queuing approach called drop-when-decoded.

The BS is assumed to have limited Channel State Information (CSI) obtained by explicit feedback from the downlink users. Given that the feedback rate and the coherence time of the channel are fixed, the question asked in this paper is: how to allocate the feedback resources optimally? Specifically, what is the optimal number of tones grouped as a subchannel, the number of users that feedback for any subchannel and the number of bits used for quantization of CSI? Analytical expressions are derived for the i.i.d. Rayleigh fading case and it is shown that there is a definite hierarchy in the importance of the three design variables. Feedback resources are first allocated to create the maximum number of subchannels possible, then to allow for more users to feedback for any subchannel and lastly to increase the precision of the channel value. Monte-Carlo simulations are performed to verify the accuracy of the derived analytical expressions.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal allocation of feedback bits for downlink OFDMA systems","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595275","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595275.pdf","startPage":"1686","endPage":"1690","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595275","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal allocation of feedback bits for downlink OFDMA systems","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595275/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156163","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal allocation of feedback bits for downlink OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001686.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.113377S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595276,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Wang","affiliation":["Department of EE, Florida Atlantic University, Boca Raton, FL, USA"],"lastName":"Xin Wang","id":"37293614100"},{"name":"Georgios B.

The optimization problem for deterministic channels reduces to an integer program known to be exponentially complex. Interestingly, the present paper shows that almost surely optimal allocation is possible at low complexity in the wireless setup, provided that the random fading channel has continuous distribution function. Specifically, it is established that the ergodic capacity achieving allocation follows a greedy water-filling scheme with linear complexity in the number of users and subcarriers. The result extends to accommodate fairness through general utility functions and constraints on the minimum average user rates. When the channel distribution is known, the optimal on-line scheme relies on low-complexity provably convergent subgradient iterations to obtain pertinent dual variables off line. To accommodate channel uncertainties, stochastic subgradient iterations provide dual variables on line with guaranteed convergence to their off-line counterparts.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595276.pdf","startPage":"1691","endPage":"1695","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595276","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595276","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ergodic capacity and average rate-guaranteed scheduling for wireless multiuser OFDM systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless communication","Optimization","Fading","Complexity theory","OFDM","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","convergence","fading channels","greedy algorithms","integer programming","iterative methods","OFDM modulation","resource allocation","stochastic processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ergodic capacity","average rate-guaranteed scheduling","wireless multiuser OFDM systems","subcarriers allocation","rate allocation","power resources allocation","optimization problem","deterministic channels","integer program","random fading channel","continuous distribution function","greedy water-filling scheme","linear complexity","general utility functions","channel distribution","optimal online scheme","convergent subgradient iterations","stochastic subgradient iterations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595276/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Ergodic capacity and average rate-guaranteed scheduling for wireless multiuser OFDM systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595276/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156164","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ergodic capacity and average rate-guaranteed scheduling for wireless multiuser OFDM systems","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053642S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595278,"authors":[{"name":"Hsiao-feng Lu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chung Cheng University, Chiayi, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Hsiao-feng Lu","id":"37065238800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595278","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Multiplexing","Encoding","Gain","OFDM"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["delays","multiplexing","OFDM modulation","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity-multiplexing tradeoff optimal codes","OFDM-based asynchronous cooperative networks","time delays","OFDM modulation","nonorthogonal selection decode-and-forward protocol","matrix codes","systematic construction","vector code","transmitted codeword vector"]}],"abstract":"An asynchronous cooperative network where different time delays among nodes exist is considered in this paper. With OFDM modulation, it is first shown that the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) achieved by the non-orthogonal selection decode-and-forward (NSDF) protocol for this network is the same as that for the synchronous one. In sharp contrast to the currently available complicated approximately universal \"matrix\" codes, a systematic construction of an extremely simple \"vector\" code is proposed. Given the transmitted codeword vector, the same codeword will be sent by all nodes during transmission, hence it will greatly reduce the complexities of relay deployment and decoding. Furthermore, it is proved that the proposed scheme achieves the optimal DMT of the NSDF protocol for this asynchronous cooperative network.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595278","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595278.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","startPage":"1701","endPage":"1705","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff optimal codes for OFDM-based asynchronous cooperative networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595278","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff optimal codes for OFDM-based asynchronous cooperative networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595278/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156166","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595278/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity-multiplexing tradeoff optimal codes for OFDM-based asynchronous cooperative networks","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001701.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045472S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595278","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595279,"authors":[{"name":"Chandra Nair","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Sha Tin, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chandra","lastName":"Nair","id":"37283169400"},{"name":"Abbas El Gamal","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, Stanford, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"El Gamal","id":"37295359000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595279","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":110},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Decoding","Random variables","Indexes","Encoding","Electronic mail","Electrical engineering"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["receiver broadcast channels","degraded message sets","Korner-Marton region"]}],"abstract":"Korner and Marton established the capacity region for the 2-receiver broadcast channel with degraded message sets.

We establish the capacity region for a class of 3-receiver broadcast channels with 2 degraded message sets and show that it can be strictly larger than the straightforward extension of the Korner-Marton region. The key new idea is indirect decoding, whereby a receiver who cannot directly decode a cloud center, finds it indirectly by decoding satellite codewords. This idea is then used to establish new inner bounds on the capacity region of the general 3-receiver broadcast channel with 2 and 3 degraded message sets. These bounds are tight for some nontrivial cases.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595279","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595279.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595279","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","startPage":"1706","endPage":"1710","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity region of a class of 3-receiver broadcast channels with degraded message sets","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595279","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The capacity region of a class of 3-receiver broadcast channels with degraded message sets","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595279/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156167","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595279/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity region of a class of 3-receiver broadcast channels with degraded message sets","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001706.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068393S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595279","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595280,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Kang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"lastName":"Wei Kang","id":"37087172792"},{"name":"Gerhard Kramer","affiliation":["Communications and Statistical Sciences Department, Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Kramer","id":"37275136700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595280","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595280","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Joints","Sufficient conditions","Decoding","Entropy","Random variables","Reliability theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channels","combined source-channel coding","Markov processes","random processes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadcast channel","joint source-channel coding","source random variables","receiver side information","Markov property","reliable transmission"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595280","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadcast channel with degraded source random variables and receiver side information","startPage":"1711","endPage":"1715","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595280","abstract":"The problem of sending a pair of correlated sources through a broadcast channel with correlated side information at the receivers is studied from a joint source-channel coding perspective.

In this paper, we study the properties of error correction in rank modulation codes. We show that the adjacency graph of permutations is a subgraph of a multi-dimensional array of a special size, a property that enables code designs based on Lee- metric codes. We present a one-error-correcting code whose size is at least half of the optimal size. We also present additional error-correcting codes and some related bounds.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595285/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595285/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10156173","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Error-correcting codes for rank modulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-correcting codes for rank modulation","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001736.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054187S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595285","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595286,"authors":[{"name":"Anxiao Jiang","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Texas A and M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"lastName":"Anxiao Jiang","id":"37065614800"},{"name":"Jehoshua Bruck","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Jehoshua","lastName":"Bruck","id":"37271794000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595286","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":6,"totalDownloads":155},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595286","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Construction industry","Indexes","Encoding","Flash memory","Indexing","Error correction codes","Nonvolatile memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["codes","flash memories"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint coding","flash memory storage","electronic memory","nonvolatile memory","block erasure","writing schemes","floating codes"]}],"abstract":"Flash memory is an electronic non-volatile memory with wide applications. Due to the substantial impact of block erasure operations on the speed, reliability and longevity of flash memories, writing schemes that enable data to be modified numerous times without incurring the block erasure is desirable. This requirement is addressed by floating codes, a coding scheme that jointly stores and rewrites data and maximizes the rewriting capability of flash memories.

We say that a network and a polynomial collection are solvably equivalent if for each field F the network has a scalar-linear solution over F if and only if the polynomial collection is solvable over F. Koetter and Medardpsilas work implies that for any directed acyclic network, there exists a solvably equivalent polynomial collection. We provide the converse result, namely that for any polynomial collection there exists a solvably equivalent directed acyclic network. (Hence, the problems of network scalar-linear solvability and polynomial collection solvability have the same complexity.) The construction of the network is modeled on a matroid construction using finite projective planes, due to MacLane in 1936. A set psi of prime numbers is a set of characteristics of a network if for every qisinpsi, the network has a scalar-linear solution over some finite field with characteristic q and does not have a scalar-linear solution over any finite field whose characteristic lies outside of psi. We show that a collection of primes is a set of characteristics of some network if and only if the collection is finite or co-finite. Two networks N and N' are ls-equivalent if for any finite field F, N is scalar-linearly solvable over F if and only if N' is scalar-linearly solvable over F. We further show that every network is ls-equivalent to a multiple-unicast matroidal network.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595306.pdf","startPage":"1838","endPage":"1842","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595306","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear network codes and systems of polynomial equations","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Galois fields","Encoding","Construction industry","Algorithm design and analysis","Channel coding","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear codes","polynomials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear network codes","linear network systems","polynomial equation","nonnegative integers","polynomial collection","scalar-linear solution","directed acyclic network","finite projective planes","multiple-unicast matroidal network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595306/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Linear network codes and systems of polynomial equations","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595306/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10174966","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear network codes and systems of polynomial equations","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001838.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076889S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595306","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595311,"authors":[{"name":"Ori Shental","affiliation":["Center for Magnetic Recording Research, University of California, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Ori","lastName":"Shental","id":"37300803300"},{"name":"Paul H.

The relay is used to manage the interference at the receivers. We pose a fundamental question: What benefits are achieved by exploiting the direct links from the sources to the receivers and whether a two-hop strategy suffices considering the pre- log factor in the capacity formula? Using a number of hybrid encoding strategies and power allocation policies, we obtain non-asymptotic achievable sum-rates, subsequently leading to achievable degrees of freedom. The results are generalized from a two-user to a if-user network. Our main result is that only k/2 degrees of freedom are achievable in an interference channel with MIMO relay, assuming global channel knowledge at the relay but not at other nodes. Thus, appropriate signaling in a two-hop scenario captures the degrees of freedom gains without the need for the direct links. We also investigate the case where the relay (unlike other nodes) has access to abundant power, showing that when sources have power P and the relay is allowed power proportional to O(P\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n), the full degrees of freedom K are available to the network.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595320","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595320.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595320","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","startPage":"1908","endPage":"1912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The interference channel with MIMO relay: Degrees of freedom","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595320","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The interference channel with MIMO relay: Degrees of freedom","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595320/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156245","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595320/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The interference channel with MIMO relay: Degrees of freedom","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0001908.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058284S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595320","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":4595321,"authors":[{"name":"Jorg Wagner","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Communication Technology Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jorg","lastName":"Wagner","id":"37402634600"},{"name":"Armin Wittneben","affiliation":["ETH Zurich, Communication Technology Laboratory, Zurich, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Armin","lastName":"Wittneben","id":"37264987800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595321","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":35},"abstract":"We consider coherent wireless MIMO multi-hop communication where n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">S</sub>\n non-cooperating source antennas communicate to n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">D</sub>\n fully cooperating destination antennas via L clusters of n\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">R</sub>\n non-cooperating relay antennas each.

Such large MIMO systems are of interest because of the high spectral efficiencies possible in such systems. The proposed detection algorithm, termed as multistage likelihood-ascent search (M-LAS) algorithm, is rooted in Hopfield neural networks, and is shown to possess excellent performance as well as complexity attributes. In terms of performance, in a 64 x 64 V-BLAST system with 4-QAM, the proposed algorithm achieves an un-coded BER of 10 3 at an SNR of just about 1 dB away from AWGN-only SISO performance given by Q(radic(SNR)). In terms of coded BER, with a rate-3/4 turbo code at a spectral efficiency of 96 bps/Hz the algorithm performs close to within about 4.5 dB from theoretical capacity, which is remarkable in terms of both high spectral efficiency as well as nearness to theoretical capacity.

Joint maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation and signal detection is of great theoretical and practical interest, especially for multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) systems where the multiple channel coefficients need to be estimated. However, this is a hard combinatorial optimization problem, for which obtaining efficient exact algorithms has been elusive for the general MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose an efficient branch-estimate-bound non-coherent optimization framework which provably achieves the exact ML joint channel estimation and data detection for general MIMO systems. Numerical results indicate that the exact joint ML method can achieve substantial performance improvements over suboptimal methods including iterative channel estimation and signal detection.

Unlike in erasure channels, the decoder for such codes needs to use all received symbols in noisy channels because each of them have some information about the transmitted message. To reduce the complexity, the receiver can discard some unreliable symbols, but it must receive more symbols due to the lost information. This results in a performance-complexity tradeoff. We also consider another scenario where a rateless code is concatenated with a fixed-rate code, which is typically used in practice, e.g., in [1]. The fixed-rate code provides a soft-decision decoding and only correctly decoded blocks are used in the rateless code decoder. If some soft information of error-detected blocks is also used, the receiver can decode the message with less received symbols at the expense of increased processing. This results in another type of performance-complexity tradeoff. For these scenarios, we find the optimal tradeoffs and show sub-optimal tradeoffs achievable by practical rateless codes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance\u2014complexity tradeoffs of rateless codes","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595351","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595351.pdf","startPage":"2056","endPage":"2060","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595351","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595351/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance\u2014complexity tradeoffs of rateless codes","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595351/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156296","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance\u2014complexity tradeoffs of rateless codes","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002056.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04675S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4595356,"authors":[{"name":"K.

To implement cooperation among receivers, we propose distributed compression: the cooperative BSs, upon receiving their signals, compress them using a distributed Wyner-Ziv code. Then, they send the compressed vectors to the central unit (also a BS), which implements decoding. In this paper, the achievable rate region of such a network is studied (particularized for the 2-user case). We devise an iterative algorithm that solves the weighted sum-rate optimization, and derives the optimum compression codebooks at the BSs.

However, in the presence of noise all known sufficient conditions require that the per-sample signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) grows without bound with the dimension of the signal. If the noise is due to quantization of the samples, this means that an unbounded rate per sample is needed. In this paper, it is shown that an unbounded SNR is also a necessary condition for perfect recovery, but any fraction (less than one) of the support can be recovered with bounded SNP. This means that a finite rate per sample is sufficient for partial support recovery. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given for both stochastic and non-stochastic signal models. This problem arises in settings such as compressive sensing, model selection, and signal denoising.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595378","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595378.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595378","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","startPage":"2187","endPage":"2191","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling bounds for sparse support recovery in the presence of noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595378","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling bounds for sparse support recovery in the presence of noise","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595378/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156343","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595378/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling bounds for sparse support recovery in the presence of noise","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062415S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595378","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595384,"authors":[{"name":"Ersen Ekrem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Ersen","lastName":"Ekrem","id":"37395816700"},{"name":"Sennur Ulukus","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA"],"firstName":"Sennur","lastName":"Ulukus","id":"37273214000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595384","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Receivers","Random variables","Encoding","Transmitters","Probability distribution","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","Gaussian channels","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative relay broadcast channels","channel secrecy","user cooperation","Marton coding scheme","compress-and-forward scheme","relay channels","rate-equivocation region","auxiliary random variables","scalar Gaussian broadcast channels"]}],"abstract":"We investigate the effects of user cooperation on the secrecy of broadcast channels by considering a cooperative relay broadcast channel.

Both constructions are convolutionally structured - one is based on faster-than-Nyquist (ftN) signaling, while the other on a diagonal layering (DL) structure. Moreover, both employ successive cancellation decoding. We show that ftN rateless codes are asymptotically capacity achieving at any signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and induce a time-invariant scalar channel.

The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) is used to analyze the system performance for all possible transmission rates. It is revealed from the analysis that the design of such rateless codes follows the design principle of approximately universal codes for parallel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels, in which each sub-channel is a MIMO channel. More specifically, it is shown that for a single-input single-output (SISO) channel, the previously developed permutation codes of unit length for parallel channels having rate LR can be transformed directly into rateless codes of length L having multiple rate levels (R, 2R,..., LR), to achieve the DMT performance limit.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595391","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595391.pdf","startPage":"2252","endPage":"2256","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595391","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rateless coding for MIMO block fading channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595391","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595391/","displayDocTitle":"Rateless coding for MIMO block fading channels","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156375","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595391/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rateless coding for MIMO block fading channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002252.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063009S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595391","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595392,"authors":[{"name":"Auguste Venkiah","affiliation":["ETIS - CNRS - ENSEA - Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Auguste","lastName":"Venkiah","id":"37868897400"},{"name":"Pablo Piantanida","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunications, Supelec, Gif-sur-Yvette, France","Department of Telecommunications, Supelec"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Piantanida","id":"37293979700"},{"name":"Charly Poullia","affiliation":["ETIS - CNRS - ENSEA - Univ Cergy Pontoise, F-95000 Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"Charly","lastName":"Poullia"},{"name":"Pierre Duhamel","affiliation":["LSS - CNRS - Supelec, Gif sur Yvette, France"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Duhamel","id":"37268164900"},{"name":"David Declercq","affiliation":["ETIS - CNRS - ENSEA - Univ Cergy Pontoise, Cergy-Pontoise, France"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Declercq","id":"37269103100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595392","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595392","abstract":"The design of efficient rateless coding schemes for multicast applications in wireless environments is investigated. First, the rateless paradigm for non-ergodic channels is introduced by making use of the dynamic-decoding nature of rateless codes that allows them to adapt opportunistically the code rate to the channel realization (assumed unknown at the transmitter). The information theoretical limits of such codes can be interpreted in terms of the notion of outage capacity. Then, we consider a quasi-static Rayleigh-fading channel with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the receiver. We show that the optimal consistent measure of information for decoding with imperfect CSI, is given by the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the received bits via a composite (more noisy) channel. The optimization of Raptor codes, which depends on the delay requirements of decoding, is obtained by using Information content evolution under Gaussian approximation. Simulation results show that optimized Raptor codes can operate very close to the theoretical limits on a wide range of delay requirements.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595392","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","startPage":"2257","endPage":"2261","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595392.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008

Our architecture is motivated by the noisy nature of personal biometrics and the requirement to provide security without storing the true biometric at the device. The principal difficulty is that real biometric signals, such as fingerprints, do not obey the i.i.d. or ergodic statistics that are required for the underlying typicality properties in the Slepian-Wolf coding framework. To meet this challenge, we propose to transform the biometric data into binary feature vectors that are i.i.d. Bernoulli(0.5), independent across different users, and related within the same user through a BSC-p channel with small p< 0.5. Since this is a standard channel model for LDPC codes, the feature vectors are now suitable for LDPC syndrome coding. The syndromes serve as secure biometrics for access control. Experiments on a fingerprint database demonstrate that the system is information-theoretically secure, and achieves very low false accept rates and low false reject rates.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595400","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595400.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","startPage":"2297","endPage":"2301","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Feature extraction for a Slepian-Wolf biometric system using LDPC codes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595400/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10156404","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595400/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Feature extraction for a Slepian-Wolf biometric system using LDPC codes","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068688S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4595401,"authors":[{"name":"Brian P.

In this paper, we first derive the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for the case that the transmitter and receiver are connected by multiple parallel and independent MIMO channels, each of which may be utilized for some limiting fraction of the total time. Our main result in this respect is an elegant geometric characterization of the tradeoff curve in terms of the Zheng-Tse tradeoff for a single MIMO channel. We then apply this result to compute bounds on the DMT for a three phase bi-directional cooperation (or two-way relay) protocol. These bounds are shown to be tight in the case of single antenna nodes and the optimal relative time duration of each phase that maximizes the diversity of the end-users is determined. The DMT derived here may also be of importance to problems where a node can be seen to receive information over channels that can be decomposed into parallel independent components, which is often the case in protocols for half-duplex cooperative networks.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595414.pdf","startPage":"2366","endPage":"2370","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for independent parallel MIMO channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Multiplexing","MIMO","Gain","Receivers","Transmitting antennas","Limiting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fading channels","MIMO communication","multiplexing","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity-multiplexing tradeoff","parallel MIMO channels","fading channels","three phase bidirectional cooperation protocol","single antenna nodes","half-duplex cooperative networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diversity multiplexing tradeoff","fading channels","MIMO","bi-directional cooperation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for independent parallel MIMO channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595414/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156418","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The diversity-multiplexing tradeoff for independent parallel MIMO channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067408S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595416,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Lusina","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Lusina","id":"37268530100"},{"name":"Robert Schober","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Schober","id":"37281221400"},{"name":"Lutz Lampe","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada"],"firstName":"Lutz","lastName":"Lampe","id":"37273228000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595416","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595416","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Protocols","Signal to noise ratio","Upper bound","Random variables","Noise","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity reception","multiplexing","protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity-multiplexing trade-off","nonorthogonal amplify-decode and forward protocol","half-duplex relay nodes","amplify and forward nodes","heterogeneous devices"]}],"abstract":"We propose a hybrid non-orthogonal amplify- decode and forward (NADF) transmission protocol for two half- duplex relay nodes.

Each transmitted block is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise that has one of two power spectral densities. The smaller of the two is the power spectral density of the thermal noise, and the difference between the two spectral densities is the power spectral density of the interference noise. The average power in the interference is constant, so the power spectral density of the interference is inversely proportional to the average fraction of the blocks that have interference. This block interference channel has been used to model partial-band interference in frequency-hop communications and to model pulsed interference in a number of communication systems. Throughput results for turbo-product and low-density parity-check codes that are used on Gaussian block interference channels are compared with the capacity bounds for such channels. For some code rates, we show that the throughput of the codes and the capacity bounds are both nonmonotonic functions of the fraction of the blocks that have interference. Applications to adaptive-rate coding are discussed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Interference","Parity check codes","Product codes","Encoding","Modulation","Protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","AWGN","block codes","channel capacity","channel coding","Gaussian channels","interference (signal)","modulation coding","parity check codes","product codes","spectral analysis","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Shannon bounds","Gaussian channel","bilevel channel","block interference channel","channel coding","channel capacity","nonbinary modulation","noncoherent demodulation","soft-decision decoding","additive white Gaussian noise","power spectral density","thermal noise","interference noise","turbo-product code","low-density parity-check code","adaptive-rate coding"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595427","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595427","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595427.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595427","startPage":"2429","endPage":"2433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shannon bounds on the throughput for Gaussian, bi-level, block interference channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Shannon bounds on the throughput for Gaussian, bi-level, block interference channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595427/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595427/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156449","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Shannon bounds on the throughput for Gaussian, bi-level, block interference channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002429.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043312S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595427","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595428,"authors":[{"name":"Sirikiat Lek Ariyavisitakul","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Sirikiat Lek","lastName":"Ariyavisitakul","id":"37349391000"},{"name":"Jun Zheng","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, USA"],"lastName":"Jun Zheng","id":"37290251000"},{"name":"Eric Ojard","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Ojard","id":"37698274000"},{"name":"Joonsuk Kim","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, USA"],"lastName":"Joonsuk Kim","id":"37657365000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595428","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Bit error rate","MIMO","Array signal processing","Complexity theory","Error analysis","Silicon carbide"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel capacity","maximum likelihood detection","MIMO communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity-balancing channel decomposition","subspace beamforming method","MIMO channel","channel capacity","geometric mean decomposition","maximum likelihood detection","ML beamforming","ML detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","SVD","GMD","subspace","maximum likelihood"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595428","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595428","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","abstract":"A subspace beamforming method is presented that decomposes a MIMO channel into multiple pairs of subchannels.

This new capacity balancing concept is key to achieving high performance with low complexity. We apply the subspace idea to geometric mean decomposition (GMD) and maximum likelihood (ML) detection. The proposed subspace GMD scheme requires only two layers of detection/decoding, regardless of the total number of subchannels, thus alleviating the latency issue associated with conventional GMD. We also show how the subspace concept makes the optimization of ML beamforming and ML detection itself feasible for any K times K MIMO system.

This has led to a large body of research in the design of codes with good distance profiles which are also used for transmission over Gaussian channels. In this paper we analyze the computational complexity of a stack decoder working on a specific tree code with real (as opposed to binary) symbols, transmitted over a memoryless Gaussian channel. In contrast to prior work that used random coding arguments, we use the intuition provided by the original proof to prove that decoding effort exhibits similar behavior even for a memoryless Gaussian channel. Our result is applicable to convolutional codes with antipodal signaling, sequence detection over Gaussian ISI channels and some sensor networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595443/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156482","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"An analysis of the computational complexity of sequential decoding of specific tree codes over Gaussian channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An analysis of the computational complexity of sequential decoding of specific tree codes over Gaussian channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002508.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061029S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595443","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595445,"authors":[{"name":"Randall Berry","affiliation":["Department of EECS, Northwestern University, USA"],"firstName":"Randall","lastName":"Berry","id":"37278715600"},{"name":"David Tse","affiliation":["Wireless Foundations, University of California, USA"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Tse","id":"37274371600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595445","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":21,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":208},"abstract":"We provide a natural formulation of information theoretic games on interference channels.

Unfortunately, the prior condition to achieve this gain requires perfect channel knowledge at both transmitter and receiver, which is impractical on account of limited feedback link. Therefore, for the practical system, codebook based feedback scheme is often employed, where the beamforming vector is selected from the codebook to maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at receiver, and the receiver only sends back the index of the best beamforming vector to the transmitter. In this paper we derive analytical expression of average bit error rate (BER) for the codebook based transmit beamforming MISO system over the feedback error channel. Using this analytical result, we present optimum codebook indexing scheme to improve the performance of this system. From some selected numerical examples we show that our proposed codebook indexing scheme can provide nonnegligible performance improvements in terms of average BER over the severe feedback error channel.","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595453/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10156492","htmlLink":"/document/4595453/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of transmit beamforming MISO system using optimum codebook indexing over feedback error channel","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of transmit beamforming MISO system using optimum codebook indexing over feedback error channel","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002558.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044853S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595456,"authors":[{"name":"Hong Wan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"lastName":"Hong Wan","id":"37392478800"},{"name":"Rong-Rong Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Utah, Salt Lake, UT, USA"],"lastName":"Rong-Rong Chen","id":"37276945900"},{"name":"Yingbin Liang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawai, USA"],"lastName":"Yingbin Liang","id":"37275171000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595456","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":135},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","MIMO","Signal to noise ratio","Wireless communication","Covariance matrix","Transmitters","Channel capacity"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","covariance matrices","MIMO communication","multi-access systems","multifrequency antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO multiaccess channels","beamforming scheme","multiple-input multiple-output point-to-point channel","multiple antennas","channel matrices","optimal beamforming angle","signal-to-noise ratio","covariance matrices","optimal input distribution"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the optimality of the beamforming scheme for both the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) point-to-point channel and the MIMO multiple access channel (MAC), where all communication terminals are assumed to be equipped with multiple antennas.

For the point-to-point channel, i.e., the single user case, we show that the optimal beamforming angle is unique and is independent of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We further show that there exists a certain SNR threshold below which beamforming is optimal and above which beamforming is strictly suboptimal. For the MIMO MAC, we show that to achieve sum capacity, the inputs from different users are independent and their covariance matrices are diagonal. We also derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimal input distribution to achieve the sum capacity. Based on these results, we investigate the conditions under which beamforming achieves the sum capacity. We show that the optimal beamforming angles are not unique, and are dependent on both the value of SNR and beamforming angles of other users. We further provide explicit conditions to determine the optimal beamforming angles for a special class of correlated MIMO MACs.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595456","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595456.pdf","startPage":"2573","endPage":"2577","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimality of beamforming in MIMO multi-access channels via virtual representation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595456","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595456/","displayDocTitle":"Optimality of beamforming in MIMO multi-access channels via virtual representation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156495","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595456/","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimality of beamforming in MIMO multi-access channels via virtual representation","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002573.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048399S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595456","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4595457,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey Loyka","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Sergey","lastName":"Loyka","id":"37276601300"},{"name":"Charalambos D.

Within this framework, two types of classes are investigated, namely, additive and multiplicative uncertainties subject to a spectral norm constraint, using partial channel state information at the transmitter side. The compound capacity is defined as a maxmin of the mutual information, corresponding to the capacity of the class, in which the minimization is done over the class of channels while the maximization is done over the transmit covariance. Closed form solutions for the compound capacity of the classes are obtained while several properties related to transmit and received eigenvectors are presented. It is also shown that capacity of the class of channels is equal to the worst-case channel capacity, while establishing a saddle-point property. Additionally, explicit closed-from solutions are given for the capacity-achieving Tx covariance matrix and the worst-case channel uncertainty. The effect of uncertainty is shown to be equivalent to an SNR loss which is proportional to the size of the uncertainty of the channel matrix measured by the spectral norm.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the capacity of a class of MIMO channels subject to normed uncertainty","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595457","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595457.pdf","startPage":"2578","endPage":"2582","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595457","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595457","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595457/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the capacity of a class of MIMO channels subject to normed uncertainty","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595457/","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156496","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the capacity of a class of MIMO channels subject to normed uncertainty","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002578.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046616S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595457","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595458,"authors":[{"name":"Lingjia Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, USA"],"firstName":"Lingjia","lastName":"Liu","id":"37293117400"},{"name":"Jean-Francois Chamberland","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A and M University, College Station, USA"],"firstName":"Jean-Francois","lastName":"Chamberland","id":"37265048300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595458","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":48,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":744},"abstract":"The concept of effective capacity offers a novel methodology to investigate the impact that design decisions at the physical layer may have on system performance at the link layer. Assuming a constant flow of incoming data, the effective capacity characterizes the maximum arrival rate that a wireless system can support as a function of its service requirements. Service requirements in this framework are defined in terms of the asymptotic decay-rate of buffer occupancy. This article studies the effective capacity of a class of multiple-antenna wireless systems subject to Rayleigh flat fading. The effective capacity of the multi-antenna Gaussian channel is characterized, and system performance is evaluated in the low signal-to-noise ratio regime. Additional to the power gain of the multiple receive antenna system, we show that there is a statistical gain associated with a multiple transmit antenna system. When the number of transmit and/or receive antennas becomes large, the effective capacity of the system is bounded away from zero, even under very stringent service constraints. This phenomena, which results from channel-hardening, suggests that a multiple-antenna configuration is especially beneficial to delay-sensitive traffic.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595458.pdf","startPage":"2583","endPage":"2587","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595458","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the effective capacities of multiple-antenna Gaussian channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Receiving antennas","Delay","Gain","Quality of service","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","Gaussian channels","MIMO communication","Rayleigh channels","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-antenna Gaussian channels","effective capacity","wireless system","asymptotic decay-rate","buffer occupancy","multiple-antenna wireless systems","Rayleigh flat fading","multiple receive antenna system","statistical gain","delay-sensitive traffic"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the effective capacities of multiple-antenna Gaussian channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595458/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156497","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the effective capacities of multiple-antenna Gaussian channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002583.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048452S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4595459,"authors":[{"name":"Krishnan Padmanabhan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Krishnan","lastName":"Padmanabhan","id":"37566857300"},{"name":"Sundeep Venkatraman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"firstName":"Sundeep","lastName":"Venkatraman","id":"37672897300"},{"name":"Oliver M.

The paper then goes on to analyze the optimal receiver and uses it to generate tight upper and lower bounds on the constrained capacity. Knowing this constrained capacity is essential to judge the efficiency of coding schemes for the channel; it performs the same function as BPSK capacity for the AWGN channel in judging LDPC codes. The paper then goes on to present a practicable correlation based receiver that uses a novel iterative channel estimation technique. The performance of this receiver remains close to the constrained capacity as long as the per-user SNR is low; there is no requirement on the aggregate SNR. With 50 users, 50 receivers and a brickwall fading channel with a coherence length of 200 symbols, for example, the correlation based receiver achieves a sum rate of 36 bits/sec/Hz, significantly greater than any current cellular standards.","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595459","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","startPage":"2588","endPage":"2592","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595459.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fading","Receivers","Channel estimation","Correlation","Signal to noise ratio","MIMO","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","channel capacity","channel coding","channel estimation","iterative methods","parity check codes","radio receivers","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noncoherent multi-antenna channels","optimal receiver","channel coding scheme","noncoherent Rayleigh flat fading channel","channel constrained capacity","BPSK capacity","AWGN channel","LDPC codes","iterative channel estimation technique","brickwall fading channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Tight upper and lower bounds on the constrained capacity of non-coherent multi-antenna channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595459/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595459/","accessionNumber":"10156498","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tight upper and lower bounds on the constrained capacity of non-coherent multi-antenna channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002588.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040512S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595463,"authors":[{"name":"Pascale Charpin","affiliation":["Codes, Domaine deVoluceau-Rocquencourt, INRIA, Le Chesnay, France"],"firstName":"Pascale","lastName":"Charpin","id":"37283987600"},{"name":"Tor Helleseth","affiliation":["Selmer Center, Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway"],"firstName":"Tor","lastName":"Helleseth","id":"37274281500"},{"name":"Victor Zinoviev","affiliation":["Institute for Problems of Information Trans, Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russia"],"firstName":"Victor","lastName":"Zinoviev","id":"37283902600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2256-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2257-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2157-8095"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2157-8117"}],"articleNumber":"4595463","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":70},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595463","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Electronic mail","Lead","Galois fields","Distance measurement","Joining processes","Informatics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BCH codes","exponential distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["classical Kloosterman sums","exponential sums","cubic sums","primitive narrow sense extended BCH codes","coset weight distribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BCH code","coset weight distribution","Kloosterman sum","cubic sum","inverse cubic sum"]}],"abstract":"Let K(a) be the so-called classical Kloosterman sums over F\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sub>\nm, where m is even.

A structured precoding scheme is proposed, where the precoder structure evolves fairly slowly at a rate comparable with the statistical evolution of the channel, and in addition, enjoys low-complexity. A particular case of the proposed scheme, semiunitary precoding, is shown to be near- optimal in matched channels where the dominant eigenvalues of the transmit covariance matrix are well-conditioned and their number equals the number of independent data-streams, and the receive covariance matrix is also well-conditioned. In mismatched channels where the above conditions do not hold, it is shown that the loss in performance with semiunitary precoding when compared with a perfect channel information benchmark is substantial. This loss can be mitigated via limited feedback techniques that provide partial channel information to the transmitter. We also develop matching metrics that capture the degree of matching of a channel to the precoder structure continuously, and allow ordering two matrix channels in terms of their mutual information or error probability performance.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4594928","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595473","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586217/4594928/04595473.pdf","startPage":"2654","endPage":"2658","doi":"10.1109/ISIT.2008.4595473","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Structured statistical precoding for correlated MIMO channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-11 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Structured statistical precoding for correlated MIMO channels","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-11 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595473/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10156533","dateOfInsertion":"08 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595473/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Structured statistical precoding for correlated MIMO channels","confLoc":"Toronto, ON, Canada","sourcePdf":"0002654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040619S","chronDate":"6-11 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586217","isNumber":"4594928","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586217","xplore-issue":"4594928","articleId":"4595473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4595474,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios K.

Under the assumption that data transmission, downlink training, and feedback are performed within the same channel coherence interval of length T symbols, the optimization of a lower bound on the achievable ergodic rate sum yields a non-trivial resource allocation tradeoff.We solve this tradeoff and provide the optimal training and feedback resource allocation for the case of zero-forcing beamforming.

We also consider a Costa-type extension of the Gaussian MAC with conferencing encoders. In this extension, the channel can be described as a two-user MAC with Gaussian noise and Gaussian interference where the interference is known non-causally to the encoders but not to the decoder.

Thus, an improved PSO algorithm for ME is empirically given to reduce computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Block Matching Algorithm Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Motion Estimation","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICESS.2008.35","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595521/4595522/04595558.pdf","startPage":"191","endPage":"195","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESS.2008.35","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595558","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Block Matching Algorithm Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Motion Estimation","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595558/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10131578","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Block Matching Algorithm Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Motion Estimation","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3287a191.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039783S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595521","isNumber":"4595522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595521","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4595522","articleId":"4595558","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4595559,"authors":[{"name":"Chung-chi Lin","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chung-chi","lastName":"Lin","id":"37291396500"},{"name":"Ming-hwa Sheu","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ming-hwa","lastName":"Sheu","id":"37271383700"},{"name":"Huann-keng Chiang","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Huann-keng","lastName":"Chiang","id":"37273839000"},{"name":"Zeng-chuan Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Zeng-chuan","lastName":"Wu","id":"38087914000"},{"name":"Jia-yi Tu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Jia-yi","lastName":"Tu","id":"38097398900"},{"name":"Chia-hung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, National Yunlin University of Science and Technology, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Chia-hung","lastName":"Chen","id":"38090374800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3287-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4595559","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":421},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interpolation","Pixel","Computer architecture","Hardware","Convolution","Digital images","Real time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","interpolation","thyristor applications","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLSI design","extended linear interpolation","real time digital image processing","image interpolation method","bicubic convolution interpolation","computational complexity","weighting coefficients","hardware architecture design","Virtex-II FPGA","digital image scaling","HDTV"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["convolution interpolation","scaling","VLSI"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a novel image interpolation method, extended linear interpolation, which is a low-cost architecture with the interpolation quality compatible to that of bi-cubic convolution interpolation.

However, unlike hard disk, flash memory does not support update-in-place operation, and each block on flash memory has the limited erasure cycles. Therefore, flash memory needs a different storage management scheme designed specifically for flash memory characteristics. Many researches adopt the log-based approach which needs an efficient cleaning mechanism to reclaim the storage space occupied by obsolete data. In this paper, we have designed and implemented a new flash translation layer for flash memory management and proposed a fast cleaning mechanism for space reclamation. It is based on the DAC technique to separately cluster hot and cold data in flash memory. For the NAND-type flash memory with large capacity, it maintains multiple LRU lists to reduce the time of selecting blocks for erasure in cleaning activity. Moreover, we modify the cost-benefit policy with different weight that considers the attribute of each block on flash memory in selecting a block for cleaning. Simulation results show that our proposed flash memory management scheme with the proposed fast cleaning mechanism could efficiently decrease the number of erase operations, speed up the cleaning activity, and enhance system performance.","doi":"10.1109/ICESS.2008.87","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595521/4595522/04595560.pdf","startPage":"205","endPage":"214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESS.2008.87","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New FTL-based Flash Memory Management Scheme with Fast Cleaning Mechanism","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595560/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A New FTL-based Flash Memory Management Scheme with Fast Cleaning Mechanism","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10131579","htmlLink":"/document/4595560/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New FTL-based Flash Memory Management Scheme with Fast Cleaning Mechanism","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3287a205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128063S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595521","isNumber":"4595522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595521","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4595522","articleId":"4595560","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595571,"authors":[{"name":"Sami Khanfir","affiliation":["Ecole Superieuredes Sciences et TechniquesDe Tunis, Research Unit of Technology of Information and Communication, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Sami","lastName":"Khanfir","id":"37886538200"},{"name":"Mohamed Jemni","affiliation":["Ecole Superieuredes Sciences et TechniquesDe Tunis, Research Unit of Technology of Information and Communication, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Jemni","id":"37265473900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3287-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4595571","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":215},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transforms","Wavelet transforms","Discrete wavelet transforms","Computer architecture","Hardware","Random access memory","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image processing","parallel algorithms","parallel architectures","pipeline processing","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reconfigurable hardware implementation","lifting-based DWT image processing algorithm","discrete wavelet transform","FPGA-based parallel implementation","pipeline processing","parallel processing","multi framed image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","DWT","Lifting","Reconfigurable","Image Processing"]}],"abstract":"A novel fast scheme for Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) was lately introduced under the name of lifting scheme.

The reduction of energy consumption is crucial to prolong the lifetime of wireless sensor networks. Dynamic power management (DPM), which is to reduce power dissipation by putting the sensor node into different states, should be carefully taken into account in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, a new method of DPM is proposed. In this method, the next eventpsilas time which is a non-stationary series is predicted as accurate as possible by wavelet neural networks. Nodes in deeper sleep states consume lower energy while asleep, but incur a longer delay and higher energy cost to awaken. So the nodes state is decided to move through the predictable time associated with the threshold time and residual power. The simulation results show that the energy consumption is significantly reduced and the whole lifetime of the wireless sensor networks is greatly prolonged with the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/ICESS.2008.36","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595521/4595522/04595585.pdf","startPage":"376","endPage":"381","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESS.2008.36","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595522","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelet Neural Network Approach for Dynamic Power Management in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595585/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet Neural Network Approach for Dynamic Power Management in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10131601","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595585/","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet Neural Network Approach for Dynamic Power Management in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3287a376.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052656S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595521","isNumber":"4595522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595521","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4595522","articleId":"4595585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4595589,"authors":[{"name":"Yongqiang Guo","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center for Metallurgical Automation and Detecting Technology Ministry of Education, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Yongqiang","lastName":"Guo","id":"38087257200"},{"name":"Kangling Fang","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center for Metallurgical Automation and Detecting Technology Ministry of Education, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Kangling","lastName":"Fang","id":"37287627100"},{"name":"Hongjun Zhou","affiliation":["Engineering Research Center for Metallurgical Automation and Detecting Technology Ministry of Education, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, China"],"firstName":"Hongjun","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37537807400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3287-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4595589","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of Fuzzy Feed-forward Decoupling System based on FPGA","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595589","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Couplings","Mathematical model","Fuzzy control","Hardware","Algorithm design and analysis","Control systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","feedforward","field programmable gate arrays","fuzzy control","hardware description languages","joining processes","process control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy feed-forward decoupling system","FPGA","field programmable logical component","EDA technology","hardware describing language","fuzzy control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Coupling","Multi-channel","Fuzzy control","FPGA","Feed-forward decoupling"]}],"abstract":"Coupling is a common phenomenon in process control system, which will decrease the performance of control systems. And what's worse, if the coupling is serious, the system can not work[1]. Therefore, it is significant to research decoupling in the fields of control theory and project practice. Nowadays, decoupling is always implemented by software. However, this method canpsilat satisfy the controlled plant for high speed because of bad real-time effect. Conversely, adopting the hardware decoupling could control the objects timely. There are many ways to realize decoupling by hardware, FPGA is an ideal method. FPGA is a kind of field programmable logical component, which adopts the EDA technology and uses hardware describing language as an expression of logic. It has many traits, such as shorter developing periods, higher speed, upgradeable online, and is suitable for teamwork. A kind of fuzzy feed-forward decoupling algorithm based on error[2] is applied in this paper. On one hand, with adopting fuzzy control, the algorithm does not rely on a mathematic model, and is able close to non-linearity. On the other hand, the speed of algorithm based on error is faster than the decoupling arithmetic based on output.Based on the analyses of a lot of coupling phenomenons, a kind of fuzzy feed-forward decoupling controller based on FPGA is designed in this paper. As a carrier with FPGA, the controller has smaller size, higher reliability, lower consumption and so on. With adopting the method of converting software idea to hardware circuit, the controller could improve the response speed. This paper chooses different plants as researching objects in the course of simulation and practice. According to the experimental results, the decoupling effect of the controller is obvious, which provides a feasible way for the development of the decoupling technology.","doi":"10.1109/ICESS.2008.51","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESS.2008.51","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595521/4595522/04595589.pdf","startPage":"405","endPage":"409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595522","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595589/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of Fuzzy Feed-forward Decoupling System based on FPGA","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10143624","htmlLink":"/document/4595589/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of Fuzzy Feed-forward Decoupling System based on FPGA","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3287a405.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048501S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595521","isNumber":"4595522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595521","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4595522","articleId":"4595589","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595606,"authors":[{"name":"Te-Shun Chou","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Te-Shun","lastName":"Chou","id":"37645626300"},{"name":"Sharon Fan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Sharon","lastName":"Fan","id":"37654750300"},{"name":"Wei Zhao","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37278812100"},{"name":"Jeffrey Fan","affiliation":["Department of ECE, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Fan","id":"37287543100"},{"name":"Asad Davari","affiliation":["Department of ECE, West Virginia University, Montgomery, WV, USA"],"firstName":"Asad","lastName":"Davari","id":"37294700700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3287-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4595606","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":83},"abstract":"In this paper, we have proposed a System-on-a-Chip (SoC) architectural design to avoid potential intrusion or attacks from external devices. Either using misuse detection or anomaly detection techniques to design intrusion detection systems, a large amount of traffic data is needed to be collected in advance for analysis. However, it is not feasible in the limited resources available in SoC systems. We propose to incorporate fuzzy clustering technique along with Dempster-Shafer theory into our intrusion detection design to solve uncertainty problems caused by ambiguous and limited information. Also, the k-NN technique is applied to speed up the detection process. We compare the results of our proposed approach with those of k-NN classifier, fuzzy k-NN classifier and evidence-theoretic k-NN classifier. It indicates that our approach is able to achieve higher detection rates than those from the other three classifiers, thus is more useful in the implementation of intrusion aware mechanism in SoC design.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595521/4595522/04595606.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"531","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICESS.2008.28","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESS.2008.28","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595522","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Intrusion Aware System-on-a-Chip Design with Uncertainty Classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["System-on-a-chip","Training","Intrusion detection","Testing","Uncertainty","Probes","IEEE 802.11 Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","pattern clustering","security of data","system-on-chip","uncertainty handling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion aware system-on-a-chip","uncertainty classification","external devices","misuse detection","anomaly detection techniques","intrusion detection","SoC systems","fuzzy clustering technique","Dempster-Shafer theory","uncertainty problems","k-NN classifier","fuzzy k-NN classifier","evidence-theoretic k- NN classifier"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["System-on-a-Chip (SoC)","intrusion detection","fuzzy logic","Dempster-Shafer theory"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595606/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Intrusion Aware System-on-a-Chip Design with Uncertainty Classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595606/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10131619","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Intrusion Aware System-on-a-Chip Design with Uncertainty Classification","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3287a527.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043614S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595521","isNumber":"4595522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595521","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4595522","articleId":"4595606","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595618,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37654897900"},{"name":"Yazhuo Dong","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yazhuo","lastName":"Dong","id":"37291358400"},{"name":"Yong Dou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Dou","id":"37285984800"},{"name":"Yuanwu Lei","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National University of Defense Technology, Changsha, Hunan, China"],"firstName":"Yuanwu","lastName":"Lei","id":"37654275500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3287-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4595618","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":548},"abstract":"Floating-point fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor and coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) element play important roles in communication and radar applications. But even with the rapid development of large-scale integrated circuit, it is usually impractical to implement these floating-point computations on FPGA, as they will consume a large amount of chip resources. In this paper, a compact SAR processor, composed of four 1D FFT-PEs (processing elements) and a CORDIC co-processor, is implemented on FPGA. In particular, a dynamic configurable pipeline is used in FFT-PE to reduce the area consumption through reusing floating-point units. And the 32-bit floating-point hybrid-mode CORDIC co-processor is implemented to generate compensation factors and compute transcendental functions in SAR image visualization phase. Experimental results show that our SAR processor performs well both in area and latency. It consumes about 40% of LUTs and DSPs, and about 48% of memory bits on a StratixII FPGA. Moreover, 32-bit floating-point hybrid-mode CORDIC co-processor only occupies about 2.6% LUTs and Registers of Virtex5 and achieves a clock frequency of 217 MHz. Regarding the latency, it takes 1232.6 ms to transform the SAR raw data of 4K*4K into a visible image of 256 grey levels and can meet the real-time requirement.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Pipelines","Azimuth","Table lookup","Clocks","Process control","Lead"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","fast Fourier transforms","field programmable gate arrays","image processing","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic configurable floating-point FFT pipelines","FPGA","fast Fourier transform","coordinate rotation digital computer","large-scale integrated circuit","compact SAR processor","compensation factors","SAR image visualization phase","LUT","DSP","StratixII FPGA","Registers","Virtex5","hybrid-mode CORDIC coprocessor","frequency 217 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic configurable pipeline","Floating-point","FPGA","FFT","CORDIC"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595618","doi":"10.1109/ICESS.2008.95","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595521/4595522/04595618.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICESS.2008.95","startPage":"616","endPage":"620","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595522","publicationTitle":"2008 International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Configurable Floating-Point FFT Pipelines and Hybrid-Mode CORDIC on FPGA","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Configurable Floating-Point FFT Pipelines and Hybrid-Mode CORDIC on FPGA","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595618/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2008","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595618/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10143628","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Configurable Floating-Point FFT Pipelines and Hybrid-Mode CORDIC on FPGA","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"3287a616.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035982S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595521","isNumber":"4595522","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595521","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4595522","articleId":"4595618","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4595624,"authors":[{"name":"Hatice Gunes","affiliation":["Sydney University of Technology, Broadway, NSW, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4749414/4595624/4595624-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hatice Gunes (S'99\u2013M'07) received the Ph.D. degree in computing sciences from the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), Broadway, Australia, in 2007.","She is currently a Research Associate with UTS, where she works on an Australian Research Council\u2013funded Linkage Project for UTS and iOmniscient Pty Ltd.

This exploration has led to the identification of the main mechanisms, including the important role played in the recognition process by the modalities' dynamics. Constrained by the human physiology, the temporal evolution of a modality appears to be well approximated by a sequence of temporal segments called onset, apex, and offset. Stemming from these findings, computer scientists, over the past 15 years, have proposed various methodologies to automate the recognition process. We note, however, two main limitations to date. The first is that much of the past research has focused on affect recognition from single modalities. The second is that even the few multimodal systems have not paid sufficient attention to the modalities' dynamics: The automatic determination of their temporal segments, their synchronization to the purpose of modality fusion, and their role in affect recognition are yet to be adequately explored. To address this issue, this paper focuses on affective face and body display, proposes a method to automatically detect their temporal segments or phases, explores whether the detection of the temporal phases can effectively support recognition of affective states, and recognizes affective states based on phase synchronization/alignment. The experimental results obtained show the following: 1) affective face and body displays are simultaneous but not strictly synchronous; 2) explicit detection of the temporal phases can improve the accuracy of affect recognition; 3) recognition from fused face and body modalities performs better than that from the face or the body modality alone; and 4) synchronized feature-level fusion achieves better performance than decision-level fusion.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.927269","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4749414/04595624.pdf","startPage":"64","endPage":"84","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4749414","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.927269","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automatic Temporal Segment Detection and Affect Recognition From Face and Body Display","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595624","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Automatic Temporal Segment Detection and Affect Recognition From Face and Body Display","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595624/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2009","dateOfInsertion":"13 January 2009","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10391590","pubMedId":"19068431","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595624/","volume":"39","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automatic Temporal Segment Detection and Affect Recognition From Face and Body Display","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-gunes-927269.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.247779S","chronDate":"Feb.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4749414","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"113","xplore-issue":"4749414","articleId":"4595624","onlineDate":"12 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-24"},{"_id":4595626,"authors":[{"name":"Yurong Liu","affiliation":["The Department of Mathematics, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4623193/4595626/4595626-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yurong Liu received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Suzhou University, Suzhou, China, in 1986, the M.Sc. degree in applied mathematics from the Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, China, in 1989, and the Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from Suzhou University in 2000.","He is currently a Professor with the Department of Mathematics, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, China.

The complex networks addressed which include neural and social networks as special cases are quite general. Rather than the commonly used Lipschitz-type function, a more general sector-like nonlinear function is employed to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. The distributed infinite time delays in the discrete-time domain are first defined. By utilizing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed discrete-time complex network with distributed delays is synchronized if certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. The state estimation problem is then studied for the same complex network, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that, for all admissible discrete and distributed delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be globally asymptotically stable. Again, an LMI approach is developed for the state estimation problem. Two simulation examples are provided to show the usefulness of the proposed global synchronization and state estimation conditions. It is worth pointing out that our main results are valid even if the nominal subsystems within the network are unstable.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.925745","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4623193/04595626.pdf","startPage":"1314","endPage":"1325","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.925745","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623193","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization and State Estimation for Discrete-Time Complex Networks With Distributed Delays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595626/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization and State Estimation for Discrete-Time Complex Networks With Distributed Delays","volume":"38","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10202464","pubMedId":"18784014","htmlLink":"/document/4595626/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization and State Estimation for Discrete-Time Complex Networks With Distributed Delays","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb05-liu.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105516S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4623193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"379","xplore-issue":"4623193","articleId":"4595626","onlineDate":"12 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4595627,"authors":[{"name":"Rong-Jong Wai","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Fuel Cell Center, Yuan-Ze University, Chungli, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/3477/4623193/4595627/4595627-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Rong-Jong Wai (A'00\u2013M'02\u2013SM'05) was born in Tainan, Taiwan, R.O.C., in 1974.

In general, it is difficult to adopt a model-based design to achieve this control objective due to the uncertainties in practical applications, such as friction forces, external disturbances, and parameter variations. In order to cope with this problem, an indirect AFNNC (IAFNNC) scheme and a direct AFNNC (DAFNNC) strategy are investigated without the requirement of prior system information. In these model-free control topologies, a continuous-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) dynamic fuzzy model with online learning ability is constructed to represent the system dynamics of an \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">n</i>\n-link robot manipulator. In the IAFNNC, an FNN estimator is designed to tune the nonlinear dynamic function vector in fuzzy local models, and then, the estimative vector is used to indirectly develop a stable IAFNNC law. In the DAFNNC, an FNN controller is directly designed to imitate a predetermined model-based stabilizing control law, and then, the stable control performance can be achieved by only using joint position information. All the IAFNNC and DAFNNC laws and the corresponding adaptive tuning algorithms for FNN weights are established in the sense of Lyapunov stability analyses to ensure the stable control performance. Numerical simulations and experimental results of a two-link robot manipulator actuated by dc servomotors are given to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodologies. In addition, the superiority of the proposed control schemes is indicated in comparison with proportional-differential control, fuzzy-model-based control, T-S-type FNN control, and robust neural fuzzy network control systems.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2008.925749","startPage":"1326","endPage":"1346","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2008.925749","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4623193","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/4623193/04595627.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Neural Network Control Design via a T\u2013S Fuzzy Model for a Robot Manipulator Including Actuator Dynamics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595627/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Fuzzy Neural Network Control Design via a T\u2013S Fuzzy Model for a Robot Manipulator Including Actuator Dynamics","volume":"38","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4595627/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10185921","pubMedId":"18784015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"09 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Fuzzy Neural Network Control Design via a T\u2013S Fuzzy Model for a Robot Manipulator Including Actuator Dynamics","sourcePdf":"38tsmcb05-wai.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082517S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"4623193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"4623193","articleId":"4595627","onlineDate":"12 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4595632,"authors":[{"name":"Ruben Ibernon-Fernandez","affiliation":["Department of Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n y Comunicaciones, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Ruben","lastName":"Ibernon-Fernandez","id":"38274506300"},{"name":"Jose-Maria Molina-Garcia-Pardo","affiliation":["Department of Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n y Comunicaciones, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Jose-Maria","lastName":"Molina-Garcia-Pardo","id":"37267388300"},{"name":"Leandro Juan-Llacer","affiliation":["Department of Tecnolog\u00edas de la Informaci\u00f3n y Comunicaciones, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Cartagena, Cartagena, Spain"],"firstName":"Leandro","lastName":"Juan-Llacer","id":"38260182200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1536-1225"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1548-5757"}],"articleNumber":"4595632","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":551},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"abstract":"In this work two different implementations of multiple-inputmultiple-output (MIMO) indoor systems are studied: distributed systems (DS) and conventional systems (CS).

Hence, it is desired to minimize the out-of-band quantization noise in order to meet stringent requirements such as receive-band noise levels in frequency-division duplex transceivers. In this paper, we address the problem of out-of-band quantization noise by introducing a novel signal-processing solution, which we refer to as ldquosegmented filtering (SF).rdquo We assess the capability of the proposed SF solution by means of performance analysis and results that have been obtained via circuit-level computer simulations as well as laboratory measurements. Our proposed approach has demonstrated the ability to preserve the required signal quality and power amplifier (PA) efficiency while providing more than 35-dB attenuation of the quantization noise, thus eliminating the need for substantial post-PA passband RF filtering.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quantization","Circuit noise","Noise level","Radiofrequency amplifiers","Radio frequency","RF signals","Amplitude modulation","Digital modulation","Baseband","Transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["band-pass filters","digital-analogue conversion","filtering theory","frequency division multiplexing","interference suppression","power amplifiers","quantisation (signal)","radiofrequency filters","signal denoising","transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["noise suppression quantization","digitally segmented amplifiers","direct digital-to-RF conversion","receive-band noise levels","frequency-division duplex transceivers","segmented filtering","signal quality","power amplifier","passband RF filtering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Amplifiers","digital-to-analog converters (DACs)","direct digital-to-RF (DDRF)","filters","polar modulation","quantization noise"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2008.2002661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel5/8919/4799355/04595639.pdf","startPage":"529","endPage":"540","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4799355","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2008.2002661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantization Noise Suppression in Digitally Segmented Amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595639","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Quantization Noise Suppression in Digitally Segmented Amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595639/","volume":"56","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2009","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595639/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"10543366","dateOfInsertion":"10 March 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantization Noise Suppression in Digitally Segmented Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tcsi-wahmed-2002661.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064779S","chronDate":"March  2009","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"4799355","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4799355","articleId":"4595639","onlineDate":"12 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4595641,"authors":[{"name":"Jiasong Wu","affiliation":["Laboratory of Image Science and Technology, School of Computer Science and Engineering, South-East University, Nanjing, China","INSERM U642, Rennes, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/4813280/4595641/4595641-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jiasong Wu was born in 1983 in Hongjiang, China.

A new mixed-radix algorithm for efficiently computing the MDCT/IMDCT is presented. The proposed mixed-radix MDCT algorithm is composed of two recursive algorithms.

Participants indicated by subsequent button press whether or not each burst of images included a target airplane feature. Image clip creation and search path selection were designed to maximize user comfort and maintain user awareness of spatial context. Independent component analysis (ICA) was used to extract a set of independent source time-courses and their minimally-redundant low-dimensional informative features in the time and time-frequency amplitude domains from 128-channel EEG data recorded during clip burst presentations in a training session. The naive Bayes fusion of two Fisher discriminant classifiers, computed from the 100 most discriminative time and time-frequency features, respectively, was used to estimate the likelihood that each clip contained a target feature. This estimator was applied online in a subsequent test session.

A small permanent magnet secured on the tongue by implantation, piercing, or tissue adhesives, is utilized as a tracer to track the tongue movements. The magnetic field variations inside and around the mouth due to the tongue movements are detected by a pair of three-axial linear magneto-inductive sensor modules mounted bilaterally on a headset near the user's cheeks. After being wirelessly transmitted to a portable computer, the sensor output signals are processed by a differential field cancellation algorithm to eliminate the external magnetic field interference, and translated into user control commands, which could then be used to access a desktop computer, maneuver a powered wheelchair, or control other devices in the user's environment. The system has been successfully tested on six able-bodied subjects for computer access by defining six individual commands to resemble mouse functions.

This interest is expected to increase in the next few years due to the advent of new architectures and communication technologies, such as wireless networks sharing the same (unlicensed) frequency band, infrastructureless wireless networks, and ultrawideband (UWB) systems. In this paper, we try to overcome some of the limitations of the existing interference models and propose an analytical framework for the evaluation of any statistical moment of the interference provided by a Poisson field of nodes located on a given region of limited area.

However, the traditional PSAM scheme requires the use of dedicated pilot subcarriers and therefore leads to a reduction in the bandwidth utilization. Accordingly, this paper investigates a channel-estimation approach for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems using a superimposed training (ST) scheme, in which the pilot symbols are superimposed onto the data streams prior to transmission. By using equally spaced pilot symbols of equal power and assuming that the number of pilots is larger than the channel order, it is shown that the channel-estimation performance is independent of the number of pilots used. The optimal ratio of the pilot symbol power to the total transmission power is analyzed to maximize the lower bound of the channel capacity. Overall, the current results show that the ST-based channel estimation schemes have a slightly poorer performance than the PSAM scheme but yield higher system capacity.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4897220/04595665.pdf","startPage":"1731","endPage":"1740","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2004041","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2004041","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897220","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595665","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Power Allocation and System Capacity of OFDM Systems Using Superimposed Training Schemes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Channel estimation","Intersymbol interference","Frequency division multiplexing","Channel capacity","Frequency estimation","Convolution","OFDM modulation","Wireless networks","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","channel estimation","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power allocation","system capacity","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","superimposed training","channel estimation","pilot-symbol-assisted modulation","bandwidth utilization","channel capacity","minimum mean square error methods"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)","superimposed","system capacity","wireless network"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595665/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Power Allocation and System Capacity of OFDM Systems Using Superimposed Training Schemes","volume":"58","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4595665/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601631","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Power Allocation and System Capacity of OFDM Systems Using Superimposed Training Schemes","sourcePdf":"tvt-li-2004041.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088287S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4897220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"37","xplore-issue":"4897220","articleId":"4595665","onlineDate":"12 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4595666,"authors":[{"name":"G.

This is due to the higher speed and the roadmap-restricted movement of vehicles. In this paper, we propose a new analytical mobility model for VANETs based on product-form queueing networks. In this model, we map the topology of the streets and the behavior of vehicles at both intersections and different parts of the streets onto different parameters of a BCMP open queueing network comprising M/G/infin nodes. This model represents a sparse situation for VANETs. To include the effect of dense situation on the mobility model, we modify the proposed queueing network as a new one comprising nodes with state-dependent service rates, i.e., M/G(n)/infin nodes. With respect to the product-form solution property of the proposed queueing networks, we are able to find the spatial traffic distribution for vehicles at both sparse and dense situations. Furthermore, we are able to modify the proposed queueing network to find the lower and upper bounds for the probability of connectivity. In the last part of this paper, we show the flexibility of the proposed model by several numerical examples and confirm our modeling approach by simulation.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2004266","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4897220","startPage":"1998","endPage":"2007","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4897220/04595666.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mobility Modeling, Spatial Traffic Distribution, and Probability of Connectivity for Sparse and Dense Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595666/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595666/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Mobility Modeling, Spatial Traffic Distribution, and Probability of Connectivity for Sparse and Dense Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2009","accessionNumber":"10601626","dateOfInsertion":"28 April 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"58","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mobility Modeling, Spatial Traffic Distribution, and Probability of Connectivity for Sparse and Dense Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-ashtiani-2004266.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058863S","chronDate":"May  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4897220","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"84","xplore-issue":"4897220","articleId":"4595666","onlineDate":"12 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4595667,"authors":[{"name":"Zhu Han","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Houston, Houston, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/4912580/4595667/4595667-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhu Han (S'01\u2013M'04) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1997 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, in 1999 and 2003, respectively.","From 2000 to 2002, he was an R&D Engineer with JDS Uniphase Corporation, Germantown, MD. from 2002 to 2003, he was a Graduate Research Assistant and, from 2003 to 2006, a Research Associate with the University of Maryland. from 2006 to 2008, he was an Assistant Professor with Boise State University, Boise, ID.

We focus, in this paper, on leveraging cooperation for resource allocation among users such that the network performance can be improved. Two important questions are answered-who should help whom among the distributively located users, and how many resources the users should use for cooperation to improve the performance. To answer these questions, a power-optimization, subcarrier-allocation, and relay-selection problem is formulated over a multiuser orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) network, which is applicable to systems such as wireless local area networks (WLANs). In the multiuser OFDM network, cooperation among different users is conducted by assigning the subcarriers of the helping users to relay a certain part of the helped users' data, while maintaining the desired rates of both helping users and helped users by means of power control and rate adaption. This way, the bandwidth efficiency of the multiuser OFDM system with cooperation is the same as that of the noncooperative OFDM system. The formulated optimization problem is an assignment problem for subcarrier usage and corresponding bit loading as well as power control. We provide an approximate closed-form solution for a two-user two-subcarrier case. Then, a suboptimal heuristic algorithm for a multiple-user multiple-subcarrier case is proposed and implemented in the base station to solve the formulated NP-hard problem. From the simulation results, the proposed scheme achieves up to 50% overall power saving for the two-user system and 19%-54% overall power saving for the multiuser case with random locations, compared with the current multiuser OFDM system without cooperative diversity. The proposed scheme is also compared to a much more complicated orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) system.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multiuser Cooperative OFDM Networks: Who Helps Whom and How to Cooperate","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2008.2004267","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/4912580/04595667.pdf","startPage":"2378","endPage":"2391","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2008.2004267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4912580","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595667","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595667/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun  2009","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Multiuser Cooperative OFDM Networks: Who Helps Whom and How to Cooperate","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/4595667/","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2009","publicationDate":"Jun 2009","accessionNumber":"10645550","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Multiuser Cooperative OFDM Networks: Who Helps Whom and How to Cooperate","sourcePdf":"tvt-han-2004267.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.142866S","chronDate":"Jun  2009","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"4912580","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"4912580","articleId":"4595667","onlineDate":"12 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":4595672,"authors":[{"name":"Zhanglei Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4655424/4595672/4595672-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhanglei Wang (M'08) received the B.Eng. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2001, and the M.S.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Duke University, Durham, NC, in 2004 and 2007, respectively, all in computer and electrical engineering.","He is currently a Hardware Design Engineer with Cisco Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA.

The on-chip decoder is small, independent of the circuit under test and the test set, and it can be shared between different circuits.

The 64-bit adder is generated by cascading four 16-bit radix-2 CVNS adders. Truncated summation of the CVNS digits reduced the number of required interconnections in the system, which in turn reduced design complexity and hardware costs.

First, a model, valid for both white noise and periodic impulse-train excitations, for the ramp-cepstrum (RC) of the one-sided autocorrelation function of an AR signal is proposed. A residue-based least-squares optimization technique is then employed in conjunction with the RC model to estimate the AR parameters from a noisy output, with a guaranteed system stability. The proposed ramp-cepstral model fitting combines the good features of both the correlation and cepstral domains, and thus provides a more accurate estimate of the parameters in a noisy environment. Extensive simulations are carried out on synthetic AR systems of different orders in the presence of white as well as colored noise. Simulation results demonstrate quite a satisfactory identification performance even for a signal-to-noise ratio of -5 dB, a level at which most of the existing methods fail to provide accurate estimation. To illustrate the suitability of the proposed technique in practical applications, a spectral estimation of a human vocal-tract system is carried out using noise-corrupted natural speech signals.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595699/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4595699/","dateOfInsertion":"17 October 2008","publicationDate":"Oct. 2008","accessionNumber":"10310769","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"55","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Identification of Autoregressive Systems in Noise Based on a Ramp-Cepstrum Model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identification of Autoregressive Systems in Noise Based on a Ramp-Cepstrum Model","sourcePdf":"55tcsii10-fattah.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066032S","chronDate":"Oct.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"4653500","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4653500","articleId":"4595699","onlineDate":"12 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4595710,"authors":[{"name":"Nihan Kahraman","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Department, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Nihan","lastName":"Kahraman","id":"37402548400"},{"name":"Tulay Yildirim","affiliation":["Electronics and Communication Department, Yildiz Technical University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Tulay","lastName":"Yildirim","id":"37267721400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1983-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1984-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4595710","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":352},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Transistors","Mirrors","Solid modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Differential amplifiers","SPICE"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analogue integrated circuits","current mirrors","differential amplifiers","multilayer perceptrons","transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["analog circuits","circuit sizing","artificial neural networks","channel widths","transistors","SPICE","general regression neural network","multilayer perceptron","current mirrors","differential amplifier"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595710","abstract":"This study introduces technology independent neural network modeling for fundamental blocks of analog integrated circuits.

The present paper addresses the theoretical research and applications developed thus far in working toward this goal. First, a theory of feature extraction is briefly introduced in a general framework of pattern recognition. Next, a scheme of adaptive (trainable with learning capability) vision system is presented, which comprises two stages of feature extraction, namely, Higher-order Local Auto-Correlation (HLAC) or its extension CHLAC (Cubic HLAC) and multivariate data analysis. Several interesting applications are demonstrated, showing the effective performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Bio-inspired, Learning and Intelligent Systems for Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595777/4595778/04595790.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"33","publicationTitle":"2008 Bio-inspired, Learning and Intelligent Systems for Security","doi":"10.1109/BLISS.2008.25","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/BLISS.2008.25","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595778","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595790","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CHLAC Approach to Flexible and Intelligent Vision Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Pattern recognition","Visualization","Artificial neural networks","Information processing","Adaptation model","Image recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","feature extraction","national security","pattern recognition","terrorism","video surveillance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intelligent vision systems","crime","terrorism","video surveillance","security purposes","flexible vision systems","inspection","human computer interaction","robotics","behavior mining","feature extraction","pattern recognition","adaptive vision systems","higher-order local auto-correlation","multivariate data analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595790/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"CHLAC Approach to Flexible and Intelligent Vision Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595790/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10131635","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CHLAC Approach to Flexible and Intelligent Vision Systems","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"3265a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092565S","chronDate":"4-6 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595777","isNumber":"4595778","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595777","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4595778","articleId":"4595790","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4595797,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongxue Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sci, Nanjing Xiaozhuang University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhongxue","lastName":"Yang","id":"37069716200"},{"name":"Adem Karahoca","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Adem","lastName":"Karahoca","id":"37273078100"},{"name":"Ning Yang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Sci, Nanjing Xiaozhuang University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"Yang","id":"38090776100"},{"name":"Nizamettin Aydin","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, Bahcesehir University, Istanbul, Turkey"],"firstName":"Nizamettin","lastName":"Aydin","id":"37265874100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3265-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4595797","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595797","abstract":"This paper presents a novel cellular neural network (CNN) templates learning approach based on Tabu search (TS) for detecting network intrusions.

In this study, an artificial immune inspired fault detection algorithm based on fuzzy clustering and genetic algorithm is developed to detect broken rotor bar and broken connector faults in induction motors. The proposed algorithm uses only one phase stator current as input without the need for any other signals. The new feature signal called envelop is obtained by using Hilbert transform. This signal is examined in a phase space that is constructed by nonlinear time series analysis method. The artificial immune algorithm called negative selection is used to detect faults. The cluster centers of healthy motor phase space are obtained by fuzzy clustering method and they are taken as self patterns. The detectors of negative selection are generated by genetic algorithm. Self patterns generated by fuzzy clustering speed up the training stage of our algorithm and only small numbers of detectors are sufficient to detect any faults of induction motor. Results have demonstrated that the proposed system is able to detect faults in a three phase induction motor, successfully.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSA.2008.4595840","startPage":"93","endPage":"98","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586177/4595816/04595840.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSA.2008.4595840","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial immune inspired fault detection algorithm based on fuzzy clustering and genetic algorithm methods","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Induction motors","Genetic algorithms","Rotors","Transforms","Immune system","Clustering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial intelligence","electric machine analysis computing","fault diagnosis","fuzzy set theory","genetic algorithms","induction motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial immune inspired fault detection algorithm","genetic algorithm methods","online condition monitoring","broken rotor bar detection","broken connector faults detection","stator current","Hilbert transform","nonlinear time series analysis method","negative selection","fuzzy clustering method","three phase induction motor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial immune system","genetic algorithm","fuzzy c-means clustering","fault diagnosis","induction motors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595840/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Artificial immune inspired fault detection algorithm based on fuzzy clustering and genetic algorithm methods","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595840/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10131356","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial immune inspired fault detection algorithm based on fuzzy clustering and genetic algorithm methods","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1569113988.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081939S","chronDate":"14-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586177","isNumber":"4595816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586177","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4595816","articleId":"4595840","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595841,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The image of a hand in the frame of a video camera is processed and the pose it is making, its current finger configuration, is detected. Often combined with position tracking, it allows for a very natural way of giving commands. Furthermore, it alleviates the use of sometimes cumbersome pieces of hardware. Within immersive virtual reality systems, the liberty of movement of the commanding hand requires extra considerations not normally dealt with by typical optical hand posture recognition interfaces for desktop system applications. This research proposes an artificial neural network approach to the recognition of hand postures. The optical capture inside an immersive virtual reality workspace and the extraction of features of this hand are facilitated by the use of a specially coded color glove.","doi":"10.1109/CIMSA.2008.4595842","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586177/4595816/04595842.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence for Measurement Systems and Applications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIMSA.2008.4595842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Artificial neural networks for real-time optical hand posture recognition using a color-coded glove","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Training","Color","Fingers","Feature extraction","Cameras","Three dimensional displays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image recognition","interactive devices","neural nets","optical tracking","virtual reality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","real-time optical hand posture recognition","color-coded glove","user-computer interaction","video camera","finger configuration detection","position tracking","virtual reality","desktop system","feature extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Networks","Computer Vision","Hand Posture Recognition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595842/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Artificial neural networks for real-time optical hand posture recognition using a color-coded glove","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595842/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"14-16 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10131358","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Artificial neural networks for real-time optical hand posture recognition using a color-coded glove","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"1569119932.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073179S","chronDate":"14-16 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586177","isNumber":"4595816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586177","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4595816","articleId":"4595842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4595843,"authors":[{"name":"Wail Gueaieb","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Wail","lastName":"Gueaieb","id":"37294232300"},{"name":"Md.

At present, such storage systems provide no strong evidence that multiple copies of the data are actually stored. Storage servers can collude to make it look like they are storing many copies of the data, whereas in reality they only store a single copy. We address this shortcoming through multiple-replica provable data possession (MR-PDP): A provably-secure scheme that allows a client that stores t replicas of a file in a storage system to verify through a challenge-response protocol that (1) each unique replica can be produced at the time of the challenge and that (2) the storage system uses t times the storage required to store a single replica. MR-PDP extends previous work on data possession proofs for a single copy of a file in a client/server storage system (Ateniese et al., 2007). Using MR-PDP to store t replicas is computationally much more efficient than using a single-replica PDP scheme to store t separate, unrelated files (e.g., by encrypting each file separately prior to storing it). Another advantage of MR-PDP is that it can generate further replicas on demand, at little expense, when some of the existing replicas fail.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595849/4595850/04595910.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"420","publicationTitle":"2008 The 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2008.68","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2008.68","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595850","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MR-PDP: Multiple-Replica Provable Data Possession","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Servers","Cryptography","Availability","Titanium","Protocols","Biological system modeling","Materials"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["client-server systems","replicated databases","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple-replica provable data possession","storage system","storage server","challenge-response protocol","client/server system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"MR-PDP: Multiple-Replica Provable Data Possession","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595910/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10131659","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MR-PDP: Multiple-Replica Provable Data Possession","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3172a411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096561S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595849","isNumber":"4595850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595849","citationCount":"209","xplore-issue":"4595850","articleId":"4595910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":4595919,"authors":[{"name":"Ali Saman Tosun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Technology, San Antonio, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ali Saman","lastName":"Tosun","id":"37063321000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-3172-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6927"}],"articleNumber":"4595919","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":29},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595919","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chromium","Resource management","Delay","Fault currents","Computed tomography","Current transformers","Circuit faults"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","query processing","replicated databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multisite retrieval problem","declustering technique","replicated data","maximum flow problem","computational complexity","query processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["declustering","retrieval","parallel I/O"]}],"abstract":"Declustering techniques reduce query response times through parallel I/O by distributing data among multiple devices.

The object pair correlations (the probability for a pair of objects to be requested together in an operation) are often highly skewed and yet stable over time for real-world distributed applications. Thus, placing strongly correlated objects on the same node (subject to node space constraint) tends to reduce communication overhead for multi-object operations. This paper studies the optimization of correlation-aware data placement. First, we formalize a restricted form of the problem as a variant of the classic Quadratic Assignment problem and we show that it is NP-hard. Based on a linear programming relaxation, we then propose a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that finds an object placement with communication overhead at most two times that of the optimal placement. We further show that the computation cost can be reduced by limiting the optimization scope to a relatively small number of most important objects. We quantitatively evaluate our approach on keyword index placement for full-text search engines using real traces of 3.7 million web pages and 6.8 million search queries. Compared to the correlation-oblivious random object placement, our approach achieves 37-86% communication overhead reduction on a range of optimization scopes and system sizes. The communication reduction is 30-78% compared to a correlation-aware greedy approach.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2008.60","publicationTitle":"2008 The 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595849/4595850/04595922.pdf","startPage":"512","endPage":"521","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2008.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595850","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Correlation-Aware Object Placement for Multi-Object Operations","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595922/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Correlation-Aware Object Placement for Multi-Object Operations","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10131670","htmlLink":"/document/4595922/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correlation-Aware Object Placement for Multi-Object Operations","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3172a512.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054731S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595849","isNumber":"4595850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595849","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4595850","articleId":"4595922","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4595959,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohui Gu","affiliation":["North Carolina State University, USA"],"firstName":"Xiaohui","lastName":"Gu","id":"37276603600"},{"name":"Spiros Papadimitriou","affiliation":["IBM Research, USA"],"firstName":"Spiros","lastName":"Papadimitriou","id":"37424981100"},{"name":"Philip S.

Failure management is essential for DSPSs that often require highly-available system operations. In this paper, we explore a new predictive failure management approach that employs online failure prediction to achieve more efficient failure management than previous reactive or proactive failure management approaches. We employ light-weight stream-based classification methods to perform online failure forecast. Based on the prediction results, the system can take differentiated failure preventions on abnormal components only. Our failure prediction model is tunable, which can achieve a desired tradeoff between failure penalty reduction and prevention cost based on a user-defined reward function. To achieve low-overhead online learning, we propose adaptive data stream sampling schemes to adaptively adjust measurement sampling rates based on the states of monitored components, and maintain a limited size of historical training data using reservoir sampling. We have implemented an initial prototype of the predictive failure management framework within the IBM System S distributed stream processing system. Experiment results show that our system can achieve more efficient failure management than conventional reactive and proactive approaches, while imposing low overhead to the DSPS.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCS.2008.34","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 The 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4595849/4595850/04595959.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595850","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCS.2008.34","publicationTitle":"2008 The 28th International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems","startPage":"825","endPage":"832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Predictive Failure Management for Distributed Stream Processing Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4595959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Toward Predictive Failure Management for Distributed Stream Processing Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4595959/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4595959/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10131702","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"17-20 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Predictive Failure Management for Distributed Stream Processing Systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"3172a825.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071695S","chronDate":"17-20 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4595849","isNumber":"4595850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4595849","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"4595850","articleId":"4595959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4595988,"authors":[{"name":"Shaobu Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"bio":{"p":["Shaobu Wang was born in 1976 in Shandong, China.

Recently, the frequency environment of power systems has been made more complicated and the quantity of second harmonic in inrush currents has been decreased because of the improvement of core steel. This will cause the traditional techniques for transformer differential protection more likely to fail. This paper presents a new scheme that enhances the protection abilities of transformer differential relays. Discrete wavelet transform is used to extract useful information from the low frequency components of the differential currents. The spectral energies of these low frequency components are calculated and the change in these energies is used as the differentiating criterion. The proposed scheme is tested using PSCAD as well as an internal fault simulation program and gave reliable and accurate results.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596000","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596000.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596000","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power transformer differential relay using wavelet transform energies","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596000","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596000/","displayDocTitle":"Power transformer differential relay using wavelet transform energies","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141710","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596000/","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power transformer differential relay using wavelet transform energies","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000118.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061029S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596000","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596008,"authors":[{"name":"Lingling Fan","affiliation":["North Dakota State University, Fargo, ND, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Lingling Fan received the BS, MS degrees in electrical engineering from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 1994 and 1997, respectively.

To prevent cascading outages, load blinders are generally used to block distance relay when there is heavy load in the system. However, conventional load blinders are not always able to discriminate between heavy loading conditions and fault conditions, especially for heavy loads with low power factor or faults with fault resistance.

The detailed comparisons of the SE performance based on the two methods are presented in this paper. While the SE solutions continue to be used by traditional EMS applications at CAISO, this paper focuses on SE solutions used by two new applications in real time. These are (1) CAISO nodal LMP real time market and (2) security applications such as voltage stability analysis (VSA). The approach used to transfer the real time SE solution to these new applications, using the XML data format, is also discussed.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596068","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596068.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596068","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"State estimator for CA ISO market and security applications - relevance and readiness","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596068","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596068/","displayDocTitle":"State estimator for CA ISO market and security applications - relevance and readiness","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141937","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596068/","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"State estimator for CA ISO market and security applications - relevance and readiness","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000265.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130522S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596068","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596075,"authors":[{"name":"R.

For this reason, modeling and control of the SRM is by no means a trivial task. It was proven by many researchers in this area, that a simple mathematical model has never able to represent the complete overall magnetic characteristics. Moreover, there is no distinct guideline about what sort of mathematical model would be suitable. To overcome this modeling problem, a self-organizing polynomial neural network is projected in this paper. With this scheme incorporated, the model is let to evolve iteratively and progressively without any prior knowledge of the plant. Subsequently, MATLAB/SIMULINK is used to model the SRM drive system. Finally, experimental results for both static and dynamic conditions are presented.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596075/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10141942","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596075/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Polynomial neural network based modeling of Switched Reluctance Motors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Polynomial neural network based modeling of Switched Reluctance Motors","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000273.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043511S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596075","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596103,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Both synthetic waveforms and fault waveforms simulated with PSCAD/EMTDC are used. Effect of the decaying dc offset on filter performance is studied in detail.

However, as outputs from wind power generation fluctuate time to time and wind power resources are available only in specific areas, deterioration of the quality of utilitypsilas power supply has become an important issue to be solved. As a countermeasure for the problem, the government began to subsidize wind power generators for storage battery systems, which enable them to make fluctuations of wind power outputs smooth. Also, an electric power company has announced technical-requirements to connect such systems to the grid. One of the requirements is to stabilize fluctuating outputs of wind power generation within a prescribed level, and the other is to operate wind power generation according to a submitted generation schedule. This paper presents two types of control systems to meet these requirements. Each control system was verified to be practical by simulations based on an actual network and data. Necessary capacities of the storage battery to fulfill two technical-requirements are determined respectively. In addition, the validity of the proposed control schemes and usefulness of storage batteries to realize the scheduled generation of wind farms are described.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596116/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596116/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10142183","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Generation scheduling for wind power generation by storage battery system and meteorological forecast","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Generation scheduling for wind power generation by storage battery system and meteorological forecast","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000352.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051759S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596116","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596135,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Lange","affiliation":["Energy and meteo Systems GmbH, Oldenburg, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4584435/4595968/4596135/4596135-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Matthias Lange studied physics in Oldenburg, Warwick (UK) and Marburg (Germany).

In general, modern short-term wind power prediction systems use either statistical or physical approaches to determine the anticipated wind power based on numerical weather forecasts. As an example the physical system Previento is described in detail. The typical accuracy of the forecasts for single wind farms as well as the aggregated production is shown. One focus of this paper is the intelligent use of multiple input from numerical weather models to improve the accuracy of the power forecast. The two main approaches that are applied operationally are ensemble predictions from one weather model and the combination of different numerical weather models. A weather-dependent combination tool that exploits the capabilities of numerical models of different weather services is described in detail. In the future, wind power predictions will be embedded deeper in the processes of grid operators and traders. An example shown here are highly localized predictions for specific grid points which can directly be used as input for power flow calculations, grid management or day-ahead congestion forecasts (DACF). In addition, the market integration of wind energy is pushed in a number of countries such that trading platforms which convert fluctuating wind power production into electricity products become more important.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596135","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596135","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596135.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"New developments in wind energy forecasting","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"New developments in wind energy forecasting","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596135/","accessionNumber":"10142255","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596135/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"New developments in wind energy forecasting","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000386.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06425S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596135","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-12"},{"_id":4596156,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Therefore it is necessary to concentrate our forces in order to reduce the application costs and to increment their performances. In order to reach this last aspect, it is important to note that the output characteristic of a photovoltaic array is nonlinear and changes with solar irradiation and the cellpsilas temperature. Therefore a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) technique is needed to draw peak power from the solar array in order to maximize the produced energy.

To properly evaluate the impact of time delay is very important for power system online stability assessment and controller design. In this paper, the maximum delayed time that power system can sustain without losing its stability is denoted as its delay margin. From the viewpoint of Lyapunov stability, when a dynamic system is critical stable at a given equilibrium point, there must exist critical eigenvalue on the imaginary axis. This paper presents a simple method to determine such critical eigenvalue by tracing eigenvalue loci of a transformation matrix. Then the critical eigenvalue is used to determine the delay margin of power system. Comparing with previous approaches, such as Lyapunov function/functional method, LMI method, root clustering paradigm method, the presented method can locate the exact delay margin with no conservativeness and with less computation burden. Moreover, it can be easily applied to the stability analysis of bulk power system with multiple time delays. Finally, single machine and infinite bus system (SMIB) and WSCC 3-generator-9-bus system are employed to validate its effectiveness.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596157","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596157.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596157","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simple method for power system stability analysis with multiple time delays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596157/","displayDocTitle":"A simple method for power system stability analysis with multiple time delays","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142329","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596157/","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simple method for power system stability analysis with multiple time delays","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000420.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.133903S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4596161,"authors":[{"name":"Bradford P.

It is a difficult task due to the complex structure of the thermal system and the variable operating points of the system. Although artificial neural networks are very efficient in thermal system fault diagnosis, their applications for fault diagnosis usually consider only a single operating point (usually at the full rated load). Thus a fuzzy neural network approach for thermal system fault diagnosis under different operating points is investigated in this paper. An extended fuzzy fault symptom calculation method suitable for different load is discussed. The feedwater heater system of a 300MW coal-fired power generation unit is taken as a fault diagnosis example. Several diagnosis tests for different faults under different operating points are carried out on a full-scope simulator of the power unit. The results under different operating points demonstrate the fault diagnosis ability of the fuzzy neural network method.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596176","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596176.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy neural network approach for fault diagnosis of power plant thermal system under different operating points","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596176/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy neural network approach for fault diagnosis of power plant thermal system under different operating points","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596176/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10142396","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy neural network approach for fault diagnosis of power plant thermal system under different operating points","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000444.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074674S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596176","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4596194,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Dong Li","affiliation":["School of Power and Automation Engineering, Shanghai University, Shanghai, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4584435/4595968/4596194/4596194-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Dong Li was born in Anhui, China, in 1976.

This system is suitable for dc output type distributed generations and energy storages. The dc power can be converted to the proper ac or dc voltages for the consumers by converters placed near loads, and these converters do not require transformers. This distributed scheme of load side converters also contributes to provide the high quality power supplying. In this research, we assumed a dc microgrid applied for residential houses. All houses have a cogeneration system such as gas engine or fuel cell. The outputs of those distributed generations are connected to the dc distribution line, and the power from the generations can be shared among the houses. The hot water from distributed generations are used in each house. We constructed a small scale experimental in our laboratory, and examined the fundamental characteristics of the dc microgrid by the experimental system when it was connected to the bulk power system. Experimental results demonstrated that the system could supply high quality power to the loads stably against sudden load variations, voltage sags of the bulk power system and short circuits of the load.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596210/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596210/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10141563","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental characteristics of DC microgrid for residential houses with cogeneration system in each house","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental characteristics of DC microgrid for residential houses with cogeneration system in each house","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047299S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596210","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596223,"authors":[{"name":"Ha Thu Le","affiliation":["University of Texas, Austin"],"bio":{"p":["Ha Thu Le (M '2002) received her BSEE from Odessa College (Odessa city, Ukraine) and MEEE from the University of Queensland (Brisbane city, Australia).

The approach effectiveness is validated by a case study where the ESS optimal ratings for eight wind farms are determined. The study also provides an economic analysis to estimate the profitability of the ESS projects. The approach proves to be a simple and flexible guide for solving the ESS-sizing problem. The quantitative results show that the ESS-application could be profitable.

This article introduces a new method based on Pareto dominance incorporated into particle swarm optimization to deal with the reactive power planning problem as a multiobjective problem. The two conflicting and noncommensurate objective functions related to the cost and the active power losses are resolved. This method uses an external archive to preserve diversity and produce a well-distributed Pareto front. This approach considers the requirement of an acceptable voltage profile at each node; all load busses are candidates for capacitor installation and the capacitors are added in binary steps. The proposed approach evaluates all possible combinations of capacitor placement considering various cost function for capacitor banks. The results provide the designer with a wide set of optimal solutions (Pareto set) to choose from.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596254/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10141673","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596254/","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Pareto Multiobjective Optimization Technique for Reactive Power Planning","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pareto Multiobjective Optimization Technique for Reactive Power Planning","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000574.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064829S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596254","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":4596274,"authors":[{"name":"Murilo da Silva","affiliation":["Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, S\u00c3\u00a3o Paulo, BR"],"bio":{"p":["Murilo da Silva was born in Brazil in 1977.

The methodology is based on the low and high frequency components of the transient signals originated from a fault situation registered in the terminals of a system. By processing these signals and using the WT, it is possible to determine the time of traveling waves of voltages and/or currents from the fault point to the terminals, as well as to estimate the fundamental frequency components. As a consequence, both faulted leg and fault location can be estimated with reference to one of the system terminals. A new approach is presented to develop a reliable and accurate fault location scheme combining the best the methods can offer. The main idea is to have a decision routine in order to select which method should be used in each situation presented to the algorithm. The algorithm was tested for different fault conditions by simulations using ATP (alternative transients program) software. The results obtained are promising and demonstrate a highly satisfactory degree of accuracy and reliability of the proposed method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An alternative fault location algorithm based on Wavelet Transforms for three-terminal lines","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596274","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596274.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596274","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596274/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"An alternative fault location algorithm based on Wavelet Transforms for three-terminal lines","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596274/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141721","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An alternative fault location algorithm based on Wavelet Transforms for three-terminal lines","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.125217S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596275,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The frequency estimation is formulated as an optimization problem, where the aim is to minimize the estimation error. The use of GAs has an advantage of better immunity against noise disturbance present in the input data. In addition, this work investigates the implementation of a GA scheme in FPGA (field-programmable gate array) in order to obtain a device that can work properly in real time. The new approach is able to accurately estimate the frequency, voltage magnitude and phase angle, simulating an on-line frequency relay. The proposed methodology provides an efficient alternative to frequency relays having advantages compared to traditional approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596275.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596275","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596275","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596275","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of Genetic Algorithms for frequency estimation in power systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency estimation","Gallium","Field programmable gate arrays","Biological cells","Estimation","Genetics","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","frequency estimation","genetic algorithms","power engineering computing","power system state estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","genetic algorithms","frequency estimation","power systems estimation","frequency deviation","voltage magnitude","phase angle","noisy sinusoid wave","estimation error","field programmable gate array","on-line frequency relay"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596275/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of Genetic Algorithms for frequency estimation in power systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596275/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141722","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of Genetic Algorithms for frequency estimation in power systems","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000612.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084336S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596275","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596312,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Accurate PMSM model is very important to advanced control system designs. However, the identification of PMSM parameters is very difficult due to the model complexity. In our previous paper, we proposed a particle swarm optimization (PSO) based parameter identification algorithm. In that paper, it has been shown that the algorithm could successfully identify model parameters from simulated and experimental data. In this paper, we describe how the algorithm can be implemented in real time. Real time implementation will result in more efficient and more accurate identification. Some preliminary simulation results are provided in this paper. The algorithm can be easily implemented in dSPACE controller and tested via real time Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) simulations. The implementation techniques can be extended to other online identification applications.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Real time systems","Mathematical model","Algorithm design and analysis","Simulation","Parameter estimation","Control systems","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameter estimation","particle swarm optimisation","permanent magnet motors","synchronous motors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PSO","PMSM","parameter identification","permanent magnet synchronous motors","advanced control system","particle swarm optimization","dSPACE controller","real time hardware-in-the-loop simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["permanent magnet synchronous motor","particle swarm optimization","parameter identification","real time implementation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596324","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596324.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596324","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efforts on real-time implementation of PSO based PMSM parameter identification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596324","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Efforts on real-time implementation of PSO based PMSM parameter identification","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596324/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596324/","accessionNumber":"10141888","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efforts on real-time implementation of PSO based PMSM parameter identification","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000688.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071099S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4596329,"authors":[{"name":"Ali H.

However, the impact of time delays in acquisition and transmission of key signals cannot be ignored. A novel direct method (DM) based on cluster treatment of characteristic roots (CTCR) is introduced in this paper to analyze the stability of a power system considering the feedback transmission delay. The complete stability view of a time delayed single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system is obtained through the direct method in time delay space. The validity of this method is verified by time domain simulation results.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596348","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596348.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596348","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability analysis of time delayed power system based on Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596348","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Stability analysis of time delayed power system based on Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots method","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596348/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141956","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596348/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability analysis of time delayed power system based on Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots method","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000728.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080904S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596348","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596375,"authors":[{"name":"Masatake Kawada","affiliation":["Institute of Technology and Science, University of Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Masatake Kawada received his Dr. Eng. degree in Electrical Engineering from Osaka University, Osaka, Japan, in 1998.

The unit commitment problem is solved using a new parameter free adaptive particle swarm optimization (APSO) approach. This algorithm provides solutions to the major demerits of PSO such as parameter tuning, selection of optimal swarm size and problem dependent penalty functions. The constrained optimization problem is solved using adaptive penalty function approach. The penalty terms adapt to the performance of the swarm. So no additional penalty coefficient tuning is required. This paper describes the proposed algorithm with the new variable formulation and presents test results on a ten unit test system. The results demonstrate the robustness of the new algorithm in solving the unit commitment problem.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596390","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596390.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new approach for solving the unit commitment problem by adaptive particle swarm optimization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596390/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A new approach for solving the unit commitment problem by adaptive particle swarm optimization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596390/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10142198","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new approach for solving the unit commitment problem by adaptive particle swarm optimization","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000790.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116978S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-10"},{"_id":4596392,"authors":[{"name":"K.

For incremental growth, it is moving away from fossil fuel based operations to renewable energy resources that are more environmentally friendly and sustainable. At the same time it has to grow to meet the ever increasing need for more energy. These changes bring very unique opportunities and obstacles. Over the past few decades many new and innovative ideas have been explored in the broad area of energy storage. They range in size, capacity and complexity in design. Some of the systems are designed for applications in large scale power and others are performing short term energy storage ride through capabilities for critical manufacturing and technology systems. Energy storage technology has become an enabling technology for renewable energy applications and enhancing power quality in the transmission and distribution power systems.

The problem of predicting the distribution of currents in the pole face is challenging due to the nonlinear magnetic behaviour of the pole material. For this reason, the problem of deriving appropriate equivalent circuit parameters that can be used in starting calculations can be much more challenging for solid pole machines than for laminated salient pole machines with dedicated cages. This paper will discuss the electromagnetic behaviour of solid pole machines during starting conditions with particular emphasis on starting currents, torques and pulsation torques. The time-stepping finite element method provides a very rigorous method of modeling the electromagnetic phenomenon during the machine acceleration but can be too time consuming to perform for routine design work. This paper describes a recent finite element study that was made, gives comparisons to actual factory tests and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the method for use in routine design work.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596486","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Calculation of the starting performance of solid pole synchronous motors by the time-stepping finite element method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Calculation of the starting performance of solid pole synchronous motors by the time-stepping finite element method","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596486/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142055","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596486/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculation of the starting performance of solid pole synchronous motors by the time-stepping finite element method","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000962.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035517S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4596496,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The purpose of UC is to minimize the total generation cost while satisfying system demand, reserve requirements, and other unit constraints. The combined-cycled units have been increasingly installed throughout the world because of their high efficiency and fast response. However, the combined-cycle units usually have multiple operating configurations. The multi-configuration characteristic causes that the UC problem is more complex and difficult to be solved. In this paper, the authors present a simplified combined-cycled unit model to efficiently solve the related mixed integer linear programming-based UC problem. By simulating two test systems, results show that the proposed model is effective to reduce the complexity of problem with losing little solution accuracy.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A simplified combined-cycle unit model for mixed integer linear programming-based unit commitment","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596496","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596496.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596496","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596496","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596496/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A simplified combined-cycle unit model for mixed integer linear programming-based unit commitment","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596496/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142131","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A simplified combined-cycle unit model for mixed integer linear programming-based unit commitment","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-000976.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077727S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596496","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4596508,"authors":[{"name":"Lie Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University of Strathclyde, UK"],"bio":{"p":["Lie Xu (M'03, SM'06) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the University of Sheffield, Sheffield, U.K., in 1999.","He held the post of principal research technologist in ALSTOM T&D before he took a lecturing post at Queen's University Belfast in January 2004.

The concept has been applied in several field tests and simulations at various levels in the power system. The agent based technology on which the PowerMatcher is built has a number of advantages above other approaches such as the flexibility of the concept to accommodate a large variety of business scenarios, the autonomy of the agents, the standardization of communication through bids and allocation, the hiding of process information, etc. Yet the field tests also have identified a number of enhancements that may lead to improved behavior of the PowerMatcher in real life circumstances. Also discussions within the power system agent community as laid down in two white papers from the IEEE Multi-Agent Systems Working Group have convinced us to focus on an architecture that enables close cooperation with other research groups in order to gain momentum for real applications. This paper will introduce a number of requirements for the next phase of development that enable the PowerMatcher to cope with new, future scenarios. The requirements lead to a number of architectural decisions that will support a more open software development trajectory.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596531/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10142289","htmlLink":"/document/4596531/","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"A novel architecture for real-time operation of multi-agent based coordination of demand and supply","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel architecture for real-time operation of multi-agent based coordination of demand and supply","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044289S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4596535,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Residue angle is closely related to the phase compensation requirement at each modal frequency and hence should not differ significantly over adjacent frequencies. This is especially true when the required phase compensation has to be provided by a limited number of lead-lag blocks which cannot change the phase appreciably over a narrow frequency range. Moreover, the signals should be selected such that the residue angles do not vary much over different operating conditions. Use of such phase angle criterion results in a set of signals which yield better performance compared to signals selected based only on the magnitude of residues. This is illustrated through simulation on a test system.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596564","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596564.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596564","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Appropriate signal selection for damping multi-modal oscillations using low order controllers","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Appropriate signal selection for damping multi-modal oscillations using low order controllers","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596564/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142423","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596564/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Appropriate signal selection for damping multi-modal oscillations using low order controllers","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001063.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046058S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596566,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

From implementation and tuning point of view, such low and fixed structure is common practice for most practical applications, including power systems. However, conventional techniques of optimal and robust control theory cannot handle the constraint of fixed-order as it is, in general, impossible to ensure a target closed-loop transfer function by a controller of any given order. This paper deals with the problem of synthesizing or designing a feedback controller of dynamic order for a linear time-invariant plant for a fixed plant, as well as for an uncertain family of plants containing parameter uncertainty, so that stability, robust stability and robust performance are attained. The desired closed-loop specifications considered here are given in terms of a target performance vector representing a desired closed-loop design. The performance of the designed controller is validated through non-linear simulations for a range of contingencies.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596566/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596566/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142425","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of fixed order robust power oscillation damper for TCSC","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of fixed order robust power oscillation damper for TCSC","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001065.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054276S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596566","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4596573,"authors":[{"name":"Mahyar Zarghami","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Mahyar","lastName":"Zarghami","id":"37072093400"},{"name":"Mariesa.

A simple UPFC dynamical model, composed of a controllable shunt susceptance on the shunt side and an ideal complex transformer on the series side, is utilized to analyze UPFC dynamical characteristics and control parameters. The corresponding energy function and the damping control strategy of a classical generator embedded with a UPFC is derived analytically. This energy-based damping control strategy can also be extended into the interconnected power systems by considering the associated two-machine equivalent model. In order to consider more detailed power system models and model uncertainty issues, we incorporate the adaptive recurrent neural network into our UPFC damping controller. This controller can be treated as neural network approximations of Lyapunov control actions in real time and can adjust the corresponding weights in the neural network by the built-in back propagation algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed control strategy is very effective for suppressing power swing even under severe system conditions.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596580","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596580.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596580","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of Lyapunov-based adaptive neural network upfc damping controllers for transient stability enhancement","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596580/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of Lyapunov-based adaptive neural network upfc damping controllers for transient stability enhancement","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10142438","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596580/","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of Lyapunov-based adaptive neural network upfc damping controllers for transient stability enhancement","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001083.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069678S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596580","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4596611,"authors":[{"name":"Dingguo Chen","affiliation":["Siemens Power Transmission and Distribution, Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Dingguo Chen (S'95-M'99-SM'2004) received the the B.S. degree from Northeastern Heavy Machinery Institute, Qiqihar, in 1988, M.S. degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 1991, and the Ph.D. degree from Oregon State University, Corvallis, in 1998, all in electrical engineering.

Generation companies have to optimize the portfolio of their generating assets to achieve maximum profitability. The optimization process involves economic allocation of generation over a period of time, which requires the load profile to be predicted for the dispatch period of minute level. This paper addresses the importance of very short term load prediction (VSTLP) in this context, and proposes three new schemes to make load predictions. The VSTLP is developed and implemented as part of Siemenspsila CPS based automatic generation control (AGC) product. Procedures involved in the proposed approaches are presented. Comparison between different approaches is made. Experimental studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596611","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596611.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596611","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural network based approaches to very short term load prediction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Load modeling","Load forecasting","Predictive models","Power system dynamics","Accuracy","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["load forecasting","neurocontrollers","power generation control","power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network based approaches","short term load prediction","power industry deregulation","automatic generation control","energy market","control performance standards","over-compliant power utilities","generation companies","very short term load prediction","load predictions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Very Short Term Load Prediction (VSTLP)","Neural Network (NN)","Load Dynamics","Automatic Generation Control","Control Performance Standard (CPS)","Dynamic Economic Dispatch"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596611/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Neural network based approaches to very short term load prediction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596611/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141905","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural network based approaches to very short term load prediction","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001126.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.10633S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596611","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4596612,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Reliable and quality power need to be ensured to meet customer requirements. In such a situation, it is extremely important that transmission line faults be identified accurately, reliably and in quick time. Fault information from relays need to be used effectively for locating the fault. Advanced signal processing tools such as discrete wavelet transform (DWT) can be used very effectively for parameterization and characterization of the fault signals. On the other hand, properly configured neural network (NN) can be utilized for classification of the faults based on the DWT signal. The present contribution uses electromagnetic transient program (EMTP) for simulation of a model transmission system and MATLAB for performing DWT and NN. Various types of faults have been simulated at different locations along the transmission line and an attempt has been made to correctly identify and locate the fault.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596642","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596642.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Proposal for a distance relaying scheme based on wavelet assisted neural network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit faults","Artificial neural networks","Discrete wavelet transforms","Neurons","Power systems","Transforms","Distance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","fault location","neural nets","power engineering computing","power supply quality","power transmission lines","power transmission reliability","relays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distance relaying scheme","wavelet assisted neural network","power supply","transmission line faults","discrete wavelet transform","electromagnetic transient program","EMTP","MATLAB","fault locations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Wavelet Transform","Distance Relaying","Fast Fourier Transform","Neural Network","Power System Faults"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596642/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Proposal for a distance relaying scheme based on wavelet assisted neural network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596642/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142061","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proposal for a distance relaying scheme based on wavelet assisted neural network","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09442S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4596656,"authors":[{"name":"Belkacem Mahdad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Biskra, Biskra, Algeria"],"bio":{"p":["Belkacem Mahdad (S'07) was born in Biskra, Algeria.

An automatic voltage reference setting technique, acting on the tap change control of the transformer supplying the network, can be used to address this problem. By measuring essential voltage points along the distribution network, an automatic voltage reference setting technique is applied to the automatic voltage control (AVC) relay. The AVC relay then controls an on-load tap changing (OLTC) transformer in order to maximise distributed generation while maintaining the feeder voltage within limits. The automatic voltage reference setting technique and its implementation are described. A closed-loop testing facility, based on a real time digital simulator (RTDS), was constructed and used to test the technique.

The converter of the DFIG has a protection system that monitors continuously the machine operation, emitting a blocking command when the limit of the rotor current is violated, due to transient disturbances occurring in the electrical grid. That implies in deactivating the DFIG control loops which affect negatively the system global controllability. This control action of the DFIG converter is accomplished by PI controllers, which gain adjustments are not a trivial task, due to the nonlinearities and the high complexity of the system. In this way an appropriate fitness function is derived to express the time domain evaluation of the DFIG with the objective to assure the DFIG continuous operation even under a fault condition and improve at the same time its transient behavior as compared with the formal methodology to design PI controllers using poles placement. The results obtained, confirm the efficiency of the proposed control design.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596751","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596751.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596751","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of optimal PI controllers for doubly fed induction generators in wind turbines using genetic algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Converters","Gain","Rotors","Gallium","Wind turbines","Transient analysis","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous generators","control system synthesis","controllability","evolutionary computation","fault diagnosis","genetic algorithms","machine control","optimal control","PI control","power grids","rotors","transient analysis","wind power plants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal PI controllers","doubly fed induction generators","wind turbines","genetic algorithm","evolutionary computation","static converters","electrical grid","variable speed wind generation systems","protection system","rotor currents","system global controllability","PI controllers","time domain evaluation","fault condition","poles placement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Doubly-fed induction generator","static converters","genetic algorithm","transient stability","wind generators"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596751/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Design of optimal PI controllers for doubly fed induction generators in wind turbines using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596751/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141537","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of optimal PI controllers for doubly fed induction generators in wind turbines using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096164S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596751","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4596765,"authors":[{"name":"Tamer A. kawady","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department Faculty of Engineering, Menoufia University, Egypt"],"bio":{"p":["Tamer A.

Different factors participate usually into these conditions such as the distributed generation concept, the own behavior of the induction generator, varying wind speed, ... etc. This, consequently, arises different challenges regarding the behavior of their protection and control schemes. In this paper, the performance of the conventional protection schemes (currently in use with wind farms) is thoroughly investigated. The aimed investigation study is carried out on a 225 MW wind farm in AL-Zaafarana-Egypt as a simulation example using MATLAB. The package represents an ideal candidate for dynamic simulation purposes with its own highly performance graphical interface and built-in libraries. The major effective factors that may influence the fault characteristics are considered such as fault position, fault type, fault resistance and pre-fault loading. This explores the performance of wind farms during faulty conditions honestly. It also visualizes the performance of their protection elements and assists enhancing their performance in the future.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596765","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596765.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance evaluation of conventional protection systems for wind farms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance evaluation of conventional protection systems for wind farms","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596765/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141568","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance evaluation of conventional protection systems for wind farms","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001360.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040947S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4596794,"authors":[{"name":"Nima Amjady","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Semnan University, Semnan, Iran"],"firstName":"Nima","lastName":"Amjady","id":"37281912100"},{"name":"Ali Daraeepour","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical Engineering, Semnan University, Semnan, Iran"],"firstName":"Ali","lastName":"Daraeepour","id":"37394036400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1905-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1906-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1932-5517"}],"articleNumber":"4596794","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":202},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596794","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mutual information","Electricity","Artificial neural networks","Training","Power markets","Forecasting","Entropy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","forecasting theory","neural nets","power markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["day-ahead price forecasting","electricity markets","mutual information technique","neural network","data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Electricity Market","Mutual information","Neural Network (NN)","Price forecasting"]}],"doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596794","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596794.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596794","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Day-ahead price forecasting of electricity markets by combination of mutual information technique and neural network","abstract":"In the new competitive electricity markets, accurate forecast of electricity prices is valuable for both producers and consumers.

When in future small non-synchronous generation units replace a significant part of the synchronous power generation capacity, the total rotational inertia of the synchronous generators is decreased significantly. This causes large frequency variations that can end up in an unstable grid. A way to stabilize the grid frequency is to add virtual rotational inertia to the distributed generators. A virtual inertia can be attained for any generator by adding a short-term energy storage to it, combined with a suitable control mechanism for its power electronics converter. In this way a generator can behave like a ldquoVirtual Synchronous Generatorrdquo (VSG) during short time intervals, and contribute to stabilization of the grid frequency.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596800","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596800","startPage":"1","endPage":"3","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596800.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual synchronous generators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596800/","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Virtual synchronous generators","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10141636","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596800/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual synchronous generators","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001408.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.115866S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"387","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596800","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4596805,"authors":[{"name":"K.

By applying phase shift control to the forward rotating and backward rotating vectors the input power factor and output power factor are decoupled and unity power factor operation is achievable at the input.","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596854.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Matrix converter fed open-ended power electronic transformer for power system application","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596854","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596854/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Matrix converter fed open-ended power electronic transformer for power system application","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10141746","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4596854/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Matrix converter fed open-ended power electronic transformer for power system application","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065198S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596854","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596913,"authors":[{"name":"Pinaki Mitra","affiliation":["Real-Time Power and Intelligent Systems Laboratory, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Pinaki Mitra (Student Member'06) was born in 1974.

The paper proposes the application of DSTATCOM to improve these power quality problems of an electric ship. DSTATCOM is a shunt compensation device, which regulates the bus voltage by injecting reactive power during the pulsed load operations. The control strategy of DSTATCOM plays an important role to meet the objectives. The paper proposes a controller design strategy which is based on particle swarm optimization (PSO). PSO, an algorithm that falls into swarm intelligence family, is very effective in solving non-linear optimization problems. Here, the optimal parameters of a controller are found using PSO. To evaluate the performance of the proposed controller, a simplified model of a ship power system is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK environment, which comprises of a 36 MW generator, 10 MW propulsion motor and pulsed loads of different values of real and reactive power. The effectiveness of the DSTATCOM and the PSO based controller are examined on the test system for pulsed loads of 100, 200 and 500 millisecond durations and also for a pulse train of 100 millisecond interval.","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596913","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596913","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596913.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A DSTATCOM controller tuned by Particle Swarm Optimization for an Electric Ship Power System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596913/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A DSTATCOM controller tuned by Particle Swarm Optimization for an Electric Ship Power System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4596913/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10141999","publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A DSTATCOM controller tuned by Particle Swarm Optimization for an Electric Ship Power System","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001566.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051146S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596913","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4596927,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, the main one is that electrical systems require small simulation time steps for accurate results. More problems arise when dealing with power converters like PWM motor drives or FACTS converters. The presence of sharp discontinuities given by the switching events pushes the simulation step down to sub-mus precision. In this paper, an FPGA-based real-time digital simulator is proposed to simulate transients in z power distribution system. A simple test system is used to verify the principle. The mathematical model for the power system under consideration is implemented in Xilinx ISE8.2 and ModelSim simulator. A description of a scalable hardware architecture for very complex systems is also introduced.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: FPGA-based fast real time simulation of power systems","publicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","doi":"10.1109/PES.2008.4596929","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting - Conversion and Delivery of Electrical Energy in the 21st Century","pdfPath":"/iel5/4584435/4595968/04596929.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PES.2008.4596929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4595968","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4596929","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596929/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: FPGA-based fast real time simulation of power systems","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142082","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Notice of Violation of IEEE Publication Principles: FPGA-based fast real time simulation of power systems","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001609.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065493S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","articleId":"4596929","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4596946,"authors":[{"name":"Paul N.

These multifaceted systems are subject to a host of challenges - aging infrastructure, generation availability near load centers, transmission expansion to meet growing demands, distributed resources, dynamic reactive compensation, congestion management, grid ownership vs. system operation, reliability coordination, supply and cost of natural resources for generation, etc. Other types of challenges facing the industry today include balancing between resource adequacy, reliability, economics, environmental constraints, and other public purpose objectives to optimize transmission and distribution resources to meet the needs of the end users. The goal is to provide a vision for a comprehensive and systematic approach to meeting the grid management challenges through new information services. These services will have as the heart of their data streams a sensor web enablement that will make the grid a part of the semantic Web.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4596956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-24 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10142176","htmlLink":"/document/4596956/","conferenceDate":"20-24 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Information services for smart grids","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information services for smart grids","confLoc":"Pittsburgh, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"PESGM2008-001687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084471S","chronDate":"20-24 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4584435","isNumber":"4595968","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4584435","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"4595968","articleId":"4596956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4596961,"authors":[{"name":"David G.

The technology lets a single PC or server simultaneously run multiple operating systems or multiple sessions of a single OS.

Virtualized systems cannot always be secured the same way as physical systems. Many virtualized systems can run on the same machine, but each one might need a different security level.

The application of signal denoising based on the statistic rule is brought forward to determine the threshold of each order of wavelet space, and an effective method is proposed to determine the decomposition level adaptively, increasing the signal-noise-ratio (SNR). In a view of the inter relationship of wavelet transform and fractal theory, the whole and local fractal exponents obtained from WT coefficients as features are presented for extracting fault signals. The effectiveness of the new algorithm used to extract the characteristic signal is described, which can be realized by the value of the fractal dimensions of those types of short-circuit fault. In accordance with the threshold value of each type of short-circuit fault in each frequency band, the correlation between the type of short-circuit and the fractal dimensions can be figured to perform extraction. This model incorporates the advantages of morphological filter and multi-scale WT to extract the feature of faults meanwhile restraining various noises. Besides, it can be implemented in real time using the available hardware. The effectiveness of this model was verified with the voltage stability analysis of simulation results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588287/4597261/04597281.pdf","startPage":"116","endPage":"119","publicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4597261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4597281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of wavelet transformation for voltage stability in distributed power system network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conferences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fractals","power engineering computing","power system faults","power system stability","signal denoising","stability","voltage control","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wavelet transformation","distributed power system network","fractal theory","short circuit fault","voltage stability analysis","signal denoising","statistic rule","wavelet space","signal-noise-ratio","local fractal exponent","fault signal extraction","characteristic signal extraction","fractal dimensions","morphological filter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Power system","voltage stability","short-circuit fault","fractal theory","wavelet transform"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4597281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Application of wavelet transformation for voltage stability in distributed power system network","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4597281/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142723","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of wavelet transformation for voltage stability in distributed power system network","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"rps0020-WeA02-5.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045743S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4588287","isNumber":"4597261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588287","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4597261","articleId":"4597281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4597285,"authors":[{"name":"Lili Liu","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Lili Liu","id":"37087184076"},{"name":"Dingwei Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Dingwei Wang","id":"38311737400"},{"name":"Hongfeng Wang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Hongfeng Wang","id":"37087540772"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1733-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1734-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"4597285","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","genetic algorithms","group theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","dynamic optimization","evolutionary algorithm","group theory","permutation-based dual scheme","dynamic order-coding problems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic Optimization Problems","Genetic Algorithm","Permutation-Based Dual Scheme"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4597285","abstract":"Dynamic optimization problems are receiving increasing attention from evolutionary algorithm community due to their general occurrences in the real world Inspired by the permutation in Group theory, a permutation-based dual scheme is introduced into genetic algorithm in order to improve its capability of addressing dynamic order-coding problems.

Also it is robust with static image compression.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597300","publicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588287/4597261/04597300.pdf","startPage":"207","endPage":"210","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597300","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4597261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A second-generation wavelet transform digital watermarking encryption algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4597300","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4597300/","displayDocTitle":"A second-generation wavelet transform digital watermarking encryption algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142796","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4597300/","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A second-generation wavelet transform digital watermarking encryption algorithm","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"rps0039-WeA05-6.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075605S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4588287","isNumber":"4597261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588287","xplore-issue":"4597261","articleId":"4597300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4597320,"authors":[{"name":"Yu-Long Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Yu-Long Wang","id":"37087734602"},{"name":"Guang-Hong Yang","affiliation":["Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, CN"],"lastName":"Guang-Hong Yang","id":"37087156650"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1733-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1734-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"4597320","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":96},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delay","Time varying systems","Delay effects","Switches","Stability analysis","Control systems","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","delay systems","distributed parameter systems","Hinfin control","state feedback","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["state feedback","Hinfin control","networked control systems","passive time-varying sampling period","LMI constraints","controller design"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NCSs","Time-Varying Sampling Period","LMIs"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4597320","abstract":"This paper studies the problem of designing robust H\n<inf xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">\u221e</inf>\n controllers for networked control systems (NCSs) with time-varying sampling period.

This paper presents a technique to improve the fault detection by using an algorithm of neural network with orthogonal basis functions based on recursion least square (RLS) technique. The method is used to identify the type and location of occurring faults from inverter output voltage measurement.

The fuzzy controller creates initial membership functions and fuzzy logic rules. the genetic algorithm, which automatically designs a fuzzy logic controller by modifying the position of controller membership functions and the commands given to the pipeline robot, optimizes the fuzzy controller. This GA-fuzzy system is used to control the mobile pipeline robot, which is equipped with an array of ultrasonic sensors to acquire the distance between the pipeline robot and obstacle. On the basis of this system, a strategy for combining local behavior control with global behavior control planning was proposed in this paper. Finally a pipeline robot runs in simulation environment. The experimental results show that appropriate control mechanisms of the fuzzy controller are obtained by evolution. The controller has evolved well enough to smoothly drive the pipeline robot in different pipe environment.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597444","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588287/4597261/04597444.pdf","startPage":"904","endPage":"908","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","publicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4597261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy controller of pipeline robot navigation optimized by genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4597444/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy controller of pipeline robot navigation optimized by genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10143376","publicationDate":"July 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4597444/","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy controller of pipeline robot navigation optimized by genetic algorithm","confLoc":"Yantai, Shandong","sourcePdf":"rps0183-WeB07-2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069577S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4588287","isNumber":"4597261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588287","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4597261","articleId":"4597444","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4597450,"authors":[{"name":"Ping Ren","affiliation":["School of Information Engineering, Shenyang University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Ping Ren","id":"37087288130"},{"name":"Liqun Gao","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Liqun Gao","id":"37087287604"},{"name":"Yang Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Yang Zhang","id":"37087204847"},{"name":"Nan Li","affiliation":["Shenyang University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Nan Li","id":"37087221761"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1733-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1734-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"4597450","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Maintenance engineering","Reliability engineering","Production","Planning","Particle swarm optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["maintenance engineering","particle swarm optimisation","production planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["composite particle swarm optimization","reliable design","production planning","maintenance planning","multipurpose process plant","multiobjective mathematical optimization problem","utilities cost","preventive maintenance cost","corrective maintenance cost","design costs","equipment initial failure rate","local optimum","dimension disasters"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multipurpose Process Plan","Reliable Design","Production","Maintenance Planning","Composite Particle Swarm Optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4597450","abstract":"In this paper, reliable design, production, and maintenance planning for multipurpose process plant is formulated as a multi-objective mathematical optimization problem.

recognition based on genetic algorithm and Fisher projection","abstract":"Based on the dynamic characteristic of speech signal, we proposed a new method of speech recognition to solve the optimal discriminant basis using genetic algorithms(GA) and Fisher projection. New optimal eigenvector separability was obtained by projecting the original eigenvector to the optimal discriminant basis. Six chinese vowels were taken as the experimental data, and the MFCC coefficients, sub-band energy ratio of wavelet transform, pitch frequency, formant frequency and zero-crossing frequency of speech signal were taken as the original eigenvector, Then the suboptimal eigenvector was found out from the original one by GA, projecting the suboptimal eigenvector selected by GA to optimal discriminat basis. Finally using chaos neural network as the classifier, Experiments show that the chaos neural network has preferable classification performance with optimal discriminant features.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4597784/","accessionNumber":"10143539","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Speech signal recognition based on genetic algorithm and Fisher projection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speech signal recognition based on genetic algorithm and Fisher projection","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"rps0523-ThBIS-3-14.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.038607S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","isNumber":"4597261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588287","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4597784","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4597789,"authors":[{"name":"Yaoqun Xu","affiliation":["Institute of System Engineering, Harbin University of Commerce, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Yaoqun Xu","id":"37087156299"},{"name":"Haiyan Yue","affiliation":["Harbin University, Harbin, China"],"lastName":"Haiyan Yue","id":"37088161735"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1733-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1734-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"4597789","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4597789","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Chaos","Optimization","Simulated annealing","Electronic mail","Indexes","Joints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","simulated annealing","travelling salesman problems","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simulated annealing","Gauss wavelet chaotic neural network","combinatorial optimization problems","annealing function","subparagraph index","Lyapunov exponent figures","search-optimization capacity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet chaotic neural network","Lyapunov exponent","Simulated annealing parameter","TSP"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597789","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588287/4597261/04597789.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","startPage":"2566","endPage":"2570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4597261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On simulated annealing parameters in Gauss wavelet chaotic neural network","abstract":"Wavelet chaotic neural networks have successfully solved function and combinatorial optimization problems.

The proposed method can guarantee all signals in the closed-loop system are uniformly bounded and the tracking error exponentially converges to a small neighborhood of zero.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588287/4597261/04597821.pdf","startPage":"2721","endPage":"2725","publicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597821","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597821","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4597261","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4597821","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Indirect adaptive robust fuzzy control for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","MIMO","Nonlinear systems","Adaptive systems","Fuzzy control","Robustness","Function approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","closed loop systems","function approximation","fuzzy control","fuzzy logic","MIMO systems","nonlinear control systems","robust control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive robust fuzzy control","MIMO nonlinear systems","fuzzy logic systems","function approximation error","closed-loop system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Adaptive Fuzzy Control","MIMO Nonlinear Systems","Robust Control","Uncertainties"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4597821/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Indirect adaptive robust fuzzy control for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10142570","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Indirect adaptive robust fuzzy control for a class of MIMO nonlinear systems","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"rps0560-FrA02-1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050941S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","isNumber":"4597261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588287","articleId":"4597821","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4597827,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-hui Wang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Hai-hui Wang","id":"37087537209"},{"name":"Wen-jie Zhao","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, Wuhan Institute of Technology, Wuhan, China"],"lastName":"Wen-jie Zhao","id":"37087906324"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1733-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1734-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"4597827","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":132},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4597827","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gallium","Clustering algorithms","Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Encoding","Algorithm design and analysis","Search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data mining","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data clustering","genetic algorithm","data mining"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Data Clustering","Genetic Algorithm","Data Mining"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597827","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588287/4597261/04597827.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","startPage":"2753","endPage":"2757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4597261","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2008.4597827","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Data clustering based on approach of genetic algorithm","abstract":"Data clustering has been an active research area in the data mining community, and genetic algorithms have been used in a wide variety of fields to perform clustering.

In this respect, two adaptive learning approaches for multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) radial basis function (RBF) neural networks, i.e. growing and pruning algorithm for radial basis function (GAP-RBF) and minimal recourse allocation network (MRAN) are employed to identify MIMO time-varying nonlinear systems. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) is proposed as a new learning algorithm for both GAP-RBF and MRAN approaches. Some desired modifications on the growing and pruning criteria in the original GAP-RBF have been proposed to make it more adequate in online identification. The performances of the algorithms are evaluated on a highly nonlinear and time-varying CSTR benchmark problem. Simulation results demonstrate the better performance of the modified GAP-RBF (MGAP-RBF) neural network with respect to the original GAP-RBF and MRAN algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/CCDC.2008.4598232","startPage":"4754","endPage":"4759","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4588287/4597261/04598232.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 Chinese Control and Decision Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2008.4598232","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4597261","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-line multivariable identification by adaptive RBF neural networks based on UKF learning algorithm","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Adaptation model","Radio access networks","Filtering algorithms","Complexity theory","Kalman filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","identification","Kalman filters","learning (artificial intelligence)","MIMO systems","multivariable control systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","nonlinear dynamical systems","radial basis function networks","time-varying systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online multivariable model identification problem","adaptive RBF neural network learning","multiinput multioutput radial basis function neural network","pruning algorithm","minimal recourse allocation network","MIMO time-varying nonlinear dynamical system","unscented Kalman filter learning algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["On-line Multivariable Identification","Multivariable Process","MRAN","GAP-RBF","UKF"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598232/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"On-line multivariable identification by adaptive RBF neural networks based on UKF learning algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4598232/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"2-4 July 2008","accessionNumber":"10143003","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-line multivariable identification by adaptive RBF neural networks based on UKF learning algorithm","confLoc":"Yantai, China","sourcePdf":"rps0971-FrD03-4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062651S","chronDate":"2-4 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4588287","isNumber":"4597261","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4588287","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4597261","articleId":"4598232","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4598274,"authors":[{"name":"Yan-e Mao","affiliation":["Northeastern university, Shenyang, China","Shenyang Institute of Aeronautical Engineering, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Yan-e Mao","id":"37087331810"},{"name":"Hongwei Wang","affiliation":["Northeastern university, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Hongwei Wang","id":"37086664328"},{"name":"Zhenhui Zhou","affiliation":["Shenyang Institute of Aeronautical Engineering, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Zhenhui Zhou","id":"37087331604"},{"name":"Yuanwei Jing","affiliation":["Northeastern university, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Yuanwei Jing","id":"37087146101"},{"name":"iying Zhang","affiliation":["Northeastern university, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"iying Zhang","id":"37087331518"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1733-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1734-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1948-9439"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1948-9447"}],"articleNumber":"4598274","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":136},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Integrated circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reference input wheel slip tracking","RBF neural network","sliding mode control","control chattering"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antilock braking system","RBF neural network","Sliding mode control","Wheel slip","Chattering"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598274","abstract":"The sliding mode controller based on the RBF neural network is presented for the purpose of controlling wheel slip.

Signal to noise ratio (SNR) and bit error rate (BER) as a function of the number of users, code weight and userpsilas effective optical power have been analyzed for this code family. Further various parameters related to improvement of performance of BER have also been discussed in this paper.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586218/4598350/04598370.pdf","startPage":"58","endPage":"61","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598370","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598350","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598370","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance considerations for Integer Lattice Design based OOC for incoherent optical CDMA system","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Adaptive optics","Optical fibers","Fiber optics","Signal to noise ratio","Multiaccess communication","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiplexing","error statistics","optical communication","orthogonal codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integer lattice design","optical orthogonal code","incoherent optical CDMA system","coding alternatives","spectral amplitude coding","synchronous OCDMA","asynchronous OCDMA","cross correlation control","signal-to-noise ratio","bit error rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Optical Code Division Multiplexing (OCDMA)","Spectral Amplitude Code (SAC)","Bit Error Rate (BER)","Multiple User Interference (MUI)","Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR)","Phase Induced Intensity Noise (PIIN)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598370/","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Performance considerations for Integer Lattice Design based OOC for incoherent optical CDMA system","isConference":true,"volume":"1","htmlLink":"/document/4598370/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10142464","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance considerations for Integer Lattice Design based OOC for incoherent optical CDMA system","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"Mo.C1.7.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088089S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586218","isNumber":"4598350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586218","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4598350","articleId":"4598370","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4598379,"authors":[{"name":"Kivilcim Yuksel","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mons, Boulevard Dolez 31, 7000, Belgium"],"firstName":"Kivilcim","lastName":"Yuksel","id":"37425852800"},{"name":"Veronique Moeyaert","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mons, Boulevard Dolez 31, 7000, Belgium"],"firstName":"Veronique","lastName":"Moeyaert","id":"37300999800"},{"name":"Marc Wuilpart","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mons, Boulevard Dolez 31, 7000, Belgium"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Wuilpart","id":"38291593300"},{"name":"Patrice Megret","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Mons, Boulevard Dolez 31, 7000, Belgium"],"firstName":"Patrice","lastName":"Megret","id":"37265454600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2625-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2626-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"4598379","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":38,"citationCountPatent":23,"totalDownloads":778},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical layer monitoring in Passive Optical Networks (PONs): A review","abstract":"Motivations, challenges and requirements of optical layer monitoring in PONs are discussed.

The questions to address for short links (avoiding the requirement for temperature control, laser patterning, differential mode delay in multimode fibres, increasing capacity at low cost) are different to those for ultra-long telecom links (mainly chromatic and polarization mode dispersion, and fibre nonlinearity), but both may be solved through the use of DSP. We have completed the construction and begun experimental tests of the first FPGA-based optical transmitter, based on the Xilinx Virtex 4 field programmable gate array chip and D/A converters, operating at 21.4 GSa/s. This will allow DSP for both short optical interconnects and long-haul transmission systems to be experimentally investigated.

However, cause of the complexity of the fiber configuration and the pump scheme, FOPA has been less realistic optical amplifier compared to other commercial optical fiber amplifiers such as an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) and a Raman amplifier (RA). Therefore, to achieve large and flattened parametric gain characteristics of FOPA, we propose a simple and practical design scheme for FOPA using single pump laser and quasi-cascaded highly non-linear fibers (HNLFs). With this design scheme, single pump laser diode and quasi-cascaded two silica-based HNLFs with different zero dispersion wavelengths were used. As results of this study, apparent improvement of the parametric gain characteristics was observed in the wavelength region near the pump wavelength and over 23 dB parametric gain was successfully achieved in the 50 nm bandwidth including the telecom C-band wavelength region. In addition, the results of 160 Gb/s \u2014 10 Gb/s DEMUX experiments with designed single-pump FOPA are also shown.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Gain","Optical fiber amplifiers","Optical fibers","Optical fiber dispersion","Nonlinear optics","Optical fiber devices","Dispersion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiplexing equipment","multiwave mixing","optical communication equipment","optical fibre amplifiers","optical parametric amplifiers","optical pumping"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadened gain","single-pumped parametric amplifier","highly nonlinear fibers","transparent optical demultiplexer","fiber-optical parametric amplifier","four-wave mixing","flattened parametric gain","single pump laser","quasicascaded highly nonlinear fiber","zero dispersion wavelength","C-band wavelength","bit rate 10 Gbit/s","bit rate 160 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ultrafast optical signal processing","optical parametric amplifiers and oscillators","highly-nonlinear fiber","phasematch"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598426","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586218/4598350/04598426.pdf","startPage":"274","endPage":"277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598350","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Broadened gain characteristics of single-pumped parametric amplifier using highly-nonlinear fibers for transparent optical demultiplexer","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Broadened gain characteristics of single-pumped parametric amplifier using highly-nonlinear fibers for transparent optical demultiplexer","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598426/","isConference":true,"volume":"1","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4598426/","accessionNumber":"10142520","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Broadened gain characteristics of single-pumped parametric amplifier using highly-nonlinear fibers for transparent optical demultiplexer","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"Th.B1.4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039105S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586218","isNumber":"4598350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586218","xplore-issue":"4598350","articleId":"4598426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4598452,"authors":[{"name":"Zakir Laliwala","affiliation":["Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, India"],"firstName":"Zakir","lastName":"Laliwala","id":"37265937800"},{"name":"Sanjay Chaudhary","affiliation":["Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology, Gandhinagar, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Chaudhary","id":"37271993900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-1671-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-1672-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2161-1890"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-1904"}],"articleNumber":"4598452","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":4,"totalDownloads":1179},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Business","Service oriented architecture","Engines","Web services","Standards","Computer architecture","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["business data processing","object-oriented programming","open systems","software architecture","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["event-driven service-oriented architecture","event-driven business process model","conceptual process flow","Web services","software component","SOA conceptual architecture","interoperable distributed heterogeneous enterprise application","event-driven SOA lifecycle"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Event-driven Service-Oriented Architecture","abstract":"Business processes are event-driven and required set of tasks to be executed to fulfill the goal. Event-driven business process model by representing process as conceptual process flows. Business process required composition of services and execution of services as per the event. Events are responsible to change the state of process so we can model the business process based event and state. Web services (WS) is emerging technology to publish, discover and invoke the software component as services. SOA is a conceptual architecture for building integrated, loosely coupled, interoperable distributed heterogeneous enterprise application by using services as building blocks. Existing service-oriented computing standards and technologies are not fully supporting event-driven business process where event-driven composition, security, state and transaction management is highly recommended. Because of the limitation of current standards do not support event-driven modeling and implementation of event-driven process. We proposed Event-driven SOA (EDSOA) as an extension of SOA to model the event-driven process chains and to achieve event-driven automation of business process.

Moreover, the use of wavelength agile laser diodes in DWDM networks has gained a lot of interest in recent years, due to emerging new applications such as optical switching and routing, which require fast switching lasers in the nanosecond regime (Coldren et al., 2000). Employment of such lasers as tunable transmitters in wavelength packet switched (WPS) networks is one of the possible applications of these devices. In such systems, the information to be transmitted could be encoded onto a destination dependent wavelength and the routing of traffic could be performed on a packet-by-packet basis. The utilization of TLs in an optical switching and routing environment would put stringent requirements on its performance. This would include increased tuning range, high side mode suppression ratio (SMSR), reduced switching time and excellent wavelength stability. The sampled-grating distributed Bragg reflector (SG DBR) TL proves to be an ideal candidate, due to its large tuning range (40 nm), high output power (10 dBm), high side mode suppression ratio (SMSR > 30 dB) and simplicity of integration.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598604","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586218/4598568/04598604.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598604","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598568","startPage":"109","endPage":"109","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wavelength tunable lasers in future optical communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598604","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Wavelength tunable lasers in future optical communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598604/","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10234039","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelength tunable lasers in future optical communication systems","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"Tu.D2.2.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035864S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2008","isNumber":"4598568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586218","citationCount":"1","articleId":"4598604","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4598615,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Small signal measurements reveal that with increasing bias the cross-gain modulation converts from low efficiency, limited to 10 GHz bandwidth to a very efficient one with bandwidths well exceeding 40 GHz. Two different saturation mechanisms are responsible for this pronounced influence of the bias current: a) total carrier depletion which leads to a slow broadband cross gain saturation and b) spectral hole burning which causes spectrally narrowband high speed XGM. With increasing current the saturation by depleting the carrier reservoir, which feeds the quantum dots, is minimized and therefore spectral hole burning becomes more dominant. Large signal wavelength conversion experiments using 50 ps pulses indicate that efficient high speed cross gain modulation is feasible for pump and probe signal detuning up to 10 nm. With increasing detuning larger pulse broadening and a decreasing efficiency is observed, consistent with the small signal results.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598615","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598615","startPage":"141","endPage":"144","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586218/4598568/04598615.pdf","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598568","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantum dot semiconductor optical amplifiers for wavelength conversion using cross-gain modulation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2008","displayDocTitle":"Quantum dot semiconductor optical amplifiers for wavelength conversion using cross-gain modulation","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/4598615/","accessionNumber":"10234048","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598615/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantum dot semiconductor optical amplifiers for wavelength conversion using cross-gain modulation","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"We.B2.3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067181S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586218","isNumber":"4598568","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586218","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4598568","articleId":"4598615","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4598678,"authors":[{"name":"Demetris Monoyios","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Informatics Department & Research Academic Computer Technology Institute, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"firstName":"Demetris","lastName":"Monoyios","id":"37993113500"},{"name":"Kyriakos Vlachos","affiliation":["Computer Engineering and Informatics Department & Research Academic Computer Technology Institute, University of Patras, Rio, Greece"],"firstName":"Kyriakos","lastName":"Vlachos","id":"37273088800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2625-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2626-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"4598678","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":78},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Genetic algorithms","Routing","Optical fiber networks","Integrated optics","Gallium","Wavelength assignment"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel allocation","genetic algorithms","optical fibre networks","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","edge disjoint paths","routing and wavelength assignment","all optical networks","indigo chromosomes"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598678","abstract":"In this paper, the routing and wavelength assignment problem in all optical networks is considered.

We use GAs to solve this problem by introducing a new fitness function based on the mean value of occurrence of the common edges between the different genes of a single chromosome. In addition, we further improve performance and particularly execution times by considering the maximum quantity of edge disjoint paths (EDPs) to initialize the population with some indigo chromosomes. These EDPs are pre-computed and inserted in the GA-RWA problem.

Therefore, physical impairments along lightpath can severely reduce network performance. For this reason, many efforts have been made to develop impairment aware routing and wavelength assignment algorithms (IRWA) in order to mitigate the impairments effects, improving the network performance. In this paper we propose and analyze the performance of an adaptive impairment aware routing algorithm based on a set of chosen input network parameters. The cost function of this routing algorithm is based on a power series expansion. The routing algorithm, called Power Series Routing (PSR), is trained by an optimization technique called Particle Swarm Optimization.

Instead, when the LPF is used to decrease the aliasing components intensity, the performance of each OFDM-UWB channel is the same as the one obtained in single-channel operation.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598740","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586218/4598708/04598740.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598740","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598708","startPage":"86","endPage":"89","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aliasing and inter-channel interference impact on the performance of multi-channel OFDM-UWB distribution in FTTH networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Aliasing and inter-channel interference impact on the performance of multi-channel OFDM-UWB distribution in FTTH networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598740/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2008","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10234173","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4598740/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aliasing and inter-channel interference impact on the performance of multi-channel OFDM-UWB distribution in FTTH networks","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"Tu.B4.4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047891S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586218","isNumber":"4598708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586218","xplore-issue":"4598708","articleId":"4598740","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4598750,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Combined with power-line communications this enables a home area network (HAN) that meets the vision of broadband home networking dasiawithout new wirespsila. A technology-independent MAC layer is foreseen to control such network and to provide services as well as connectivity to any device the user wishes to connect. Moreover, this MAC layer should allow the service to follow the user from device to device in any room of a building /apartment. The contribution presents ideas and approaches for broadband optical wireless (OW) communications using infrared Gb/s hotspots and 100 Mb/s information broadcasting by means of interior lighting based on white-light LEDs.

This development will continue in the next couple of decades and allegorizes a challenge for the future next generation networks. Taking this into account the end-user will need higher data rates, getting theoretical access to the full available bandwidth of the backbone delivered to the home. Free space optics (FSO) is an excellent supplement to conventional radio links and fiber optics, capable of handling point-to-point and point-to-multipoint connections. On the one hand-side FSO is a broadband wireless solution for the \"last mile\" connectivity in metropolitan networks, on the other hand-side FSO can be used to interlink locations within one local area network. In the last years different types of cost-effective systems were developed and realized at the Institute of Broadband Communication of Graz University of Technology (TU Graz). The first type was based on a modular concept using available standard components allowing demonstrations at a data rate of 2 times 10 Mbit/s for short distances up to 300 m at a specific power margin of 25 dB/km. Later the units were improved to allow a data rate of 100 Mbit/s, higher data rates are currently under development. The reliability and availability of a FSO-link is mainly determined by the local atmospheric conditions, in free space the transmitted light is reflected, refracted or absorbed by objects, rain, fog, wind or sun. All these parameters directly influence the quality of a FSO-link and indirectly affect the quality of an access network. Many FSO-installations (permanent and nomadic use) have been set-up in the area of Styria by TU Graz and cooperation partners. In this contribution we will show some practical installations for different events, including the latest permanent installation, which was started in the summer of 2007 together with the municipality of Dobl, a small suburb of Graz, and the ML11 GmbH, an IT-company. Within this cooperation the elementary school of Dobl was connected to the Internet via FSO. The FSO-units were successfully installed and the setup is now used to explore the influence of weather on the FSO-link in the area of Graz.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598763","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586218/4598708/04598763.pdf","startPage":"178","endPage":"183","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High reliable optical wireless links for the last mile access","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598763/","displayDocTitle":"High reliable optical wireless links for the last mile access","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10207864","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4598763/","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High reliable optical wireless links for the last mile access","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"We.C4.1.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085402S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586218","isNumber":"4598708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586218","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4598708","articleId":"4598763","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4598765,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew D.

Results are presented that show by dynamically controlling the powers of individual diffusion spots, a consistent power distribution, with negligible impact to bandwidth and rms delay spread, can be created in multiple rooms, independent of the reflection characteristics and user movement patterns. The advantageous adaptability of the genetic algorithm approach removes the need for bespoke design and provides for a more cost effective system, capable of deployment in multiple locations whilst improving end user friendliness. Results have been presented based around the use of a single element receiver with a FOV = 55deg in conjunction with two algorithms that are shown to be capable of reducing the dynamic range, referenced against the peak received power, by up to 26% when empty and furthermore, maintaining to the within 7% of this optimised case, the power distribution when the user perturbs the channel through movement.","doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598765","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586218/4598708/04598765.pdf","startPage":"189","endPage":"192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Genetic algorithm channel control for indoor optical wireless communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598765/","displayDocTitle":"Genetic algorithm channel control for indoor optical wireless communications","volume":"4","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2008","accessionNumber":"10234196","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4598765/","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Genetic algorithm channel control for indoor optical wireless communications","confLoc":"Athens, Greece","sourcePdf":"We.C4.3.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05536S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586218","isNumber":"4598708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586218","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4598708","articleId":"4598765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4598766,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zeng","affiliation":["Communications and Signal Processing Research Group, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"lastName":"Yu Zeng","id":"37087578592"},{"name":"Roger Green","affiliation":["Communications and Signal Processing Research Group, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Roger","lastName":"Green","id":"37272743700"},{"name":"Mark Leeson","affiliation":["Communications and Signal Processing Research Group, University of Warwick, Coventry, UK"],"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"Leeson","id":"37264957100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2625-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2626-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-7339"}],"articleNumber":"4598766","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":577},"abstract":"The increasing demand for high speed optical wireless applications has strongly motivated recent research work towards improvement in the throughput of the optical channels. Numerous modulation schemes have been studied in this area. Multiple pulse position modulation (MPPM) has proved to be more power efficient than other modulation schemes such as on off keying (OOK), pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), and pulse position modulation (PPM). However, MPPM is not a strong candidate when the bandwidth efficiency is taken into account. To achieve optimum power and bandwidth efficiency, a new modulation scheme, multiple pulse amplitude and position modulation (MPAPM), is proposed. This paper analyses the proposed modulation scheme in terms of bandwidth requirements and power efficiency. The new scheme delivers an improvement in energy per unit bandwidth of 10 dB.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Bandwidth","Optical pulses","Optical modulation","Optical receivers","Integrated optics","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","pulse amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiple pulse amplitude modulation","optical wireless channel","multiple pulse position modulation","bandwidth requirement","power efficiency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MPPM","MPAPM","modulation schemes","optical wireless"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598766","publicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 10th Anniversary International Conference on Transparent Optical Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/4586218/4598708/04598766.pdf","startPage":"193","endPage":"196","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICTON.2008.4598766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple pulse amplitude and position modulation for the optical wireless channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598766","pubTopics":[{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multiple pulse amplitude and position modulation for the optical wireless channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598766/","isConference":true,"volume":"4","publicationDate":"June 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4598766/","accessionNumber":"10234197","conferenceDate":"22-26 June 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"22-26 June 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple pulse amplitude and position modulation for the optical wireless channel","confLoc":"Athens","sourcePdf":"We.C4.4.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040479S","chronDate":"22-26 June 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4586218","isNumber":"4598708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4586218","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"4598708","articleId":"4598766","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":4598767,"authors":[{"name":"Mark S.

A contrastive research was made between the conventional direct torque control system and the fuzzy control system based on RBF.

In this method, the video is watermarked so that its display is not permitted if a compliant video player detects the watermark. A watermark that is robust to geometric distortions (rotation, scaling, cropping) and lossy compression is required in order to block access to media content that has been re-recorded with a camera inside a movie theater. We introduce a new video watermarking algorithm for playback control that takes advantage of the properties of the dual-tree complex wavelet transform. This transform offers the advantages of the regular and the complex wavelets (perfect reconstruction, shift invariance, and good directional selectivity). Our method relies on these characteristics to create a watermark that is robust to geometric distortions and lossy compression. The proposed scheme is simple to implement and outperforms comparable methods when tested against geometric distortions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel5/10206/4598817/04598820.pdf","startPage":"466","endPage":"474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2008.927421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2008.927421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598817","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Video Watermarking Scheme Based on the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Wavelet transforms","Video compression","Motion pictures","Video equipment","Robustness","Displays","Cameras","Continuous wavelet transforms","Mexico Council"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","trees (mathematics)","video coding","watermarking","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["video watermarking scheme","dual-tree complex wavelet transform","theater camcorder piracy","playback control enforcement","compliant video player","geometric distortions","lossy compression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access control","complex wavelet transform (CWT)","content dependent","geometric attacks","watermarking"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598820/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Video Watermarking Scheme Based on the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","volume":"3","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4598820/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145472","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Video Watermarking Scheme Based on the Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"03tifs03-coria.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061723S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"4598817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"48","xplore-issue":"4598817","articleId":"4598820","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4598837,"authors":[{"name":"Sathish Ramani","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Sathish","lastName":"Ramani","id":"37286001600"},{"name":"Thierry Blu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, New Territories, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Thierry","lastName":"Blu","id":"37283397300"},{"name":"Michael Unser","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG), Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Unser","id":"37284958500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1057-7149"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0042"}],"articleNumber":"4598837","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":199,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1514},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise reduction","Smoothing methods","Noise measurement","Wiener filter","Biomedical measurements","Bayesian methods","Image restoration","Signal restoration","Gaussian noise","Filtering algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian noise","image denoising","image restoration","mean square error methods","Monte Carlo methods","optimisation","risk analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Monte-Carlo SURE","Stein unbiased risk estimate","black-box optimization","regularization parameter","signal denoising algorithm","corrupted signal restoration","white Gaussian noise","mean-squared error","image-denoising algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Monte-Carlo methods","regularization parameter","smoothing splines","Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE)","total-variation denoising","wavelet denoising"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artifacts","Computer Simulation","Data Interpretation, Statistical","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Models, Statistical","Monte Carlo Method","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of optimizing the parameters of a given denoising algorithm for restoration of a signal corrupted by white Gaussian noise.

Specifically, we present a novel Monte-Carlo technique which enables the user to calculate SURE for an arbitrary denoising algorithm characterized by some specific parameter setting. Our method is a black-box approach which solely uses the response of the denoising operator to additional input noise and does not ask for any information about its functional form. This, therefore, permits the use of SURE for optimization of a wide variety of denoising algorithms. We justify our claims by presenting experimental results for SURE-based optimization of a series of popular image-denoising algorithms such as total-variation denoising, wavelet soft-thresholding, and Wiener filtering/smoothing splines. In the process, we also compare the performance of these methods. We demonstrate numerically that SURE computed using the new approach accurately predicts the true MSE for all the considered algorithms. We also show that SURE uncovers the optimal values of the parameters in all cases.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2001404","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4598831/04598837.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2001404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598831","startPage":"1540","endPage":"1554","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Monte-Carlo Sure: A Black-Box Optimization of Regularization Parameters for General Denoising Algorithms","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Monte-Carlo Sure: A Black-Box Optimization of Regularization Parameters for General Denoising Algorithms","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598837/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10408261","pubMedId":"18701393","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Monte-Carlo Sure: A Black-Box Optimization of Regularization Parameters for General Denoising Algorithms","sourcePdf":"17tip09-sramani-2001404.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048798S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","isNumber":"4598831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"199","articleId":"4598837","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":4598839,"authors":[{"name":"Sumohana S.

Where can the robot move its center of mass (CM) while remaining in static equilibrium? If the terrain is flat, the CM must lie above the convex hull of the robot's feet. If the terrain is not flat, this often-used approximation can be arbitrarily bad. Instead, the CM must lie above the projection of a nonlinear convex set that is defined by the properties of each foot placement. This paper presents an algorithm to compute the shape of this projection and gives a tight bound on the algorithm's running time. It also presents a method of amortizing the cost of this computation when it is only necessary to test static equilibrium at particular CM positions--that is, when it is only necessary to test the membership of points in the projection of a convex set rather than find its shape.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4598893/04598894.pdf","startPage":"794","endPage":"807","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.2001360","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.2001360","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598893","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598894","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Testing Static Equilibrium for Legged Robots","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Testing","Legged locomotion","Foot","Gravity","Shape","Computational efficiency","Friction","Computational geometry","Mobile robots","Motion planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["legged locomotion","robot dynamics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["legged robots","testing static equilibrium","fixed foot placements","center of mass","static equilibrium","test static equilibrium","convex set projection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Computational geometry","frictional contact","legged locomotion","mobile robots","motion planning","static equilibrium"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598894/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Testing Static Equilibrium for Legged Robots","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4598894/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144729","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Testing Static Equilibrium for Legged Robots","sourcePdf":"24tro04-bretl.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.092845S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4598893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"4598893","articleId":"4598894","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":4598902,"authors":[{"name":"Jagadeesan Jayender","affiliation":["University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4598893/4598902/4598902-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jagadeesan Jayender (S'06\u2013M'08) was born in Hyderabad, India, on February 4, 1982.

Angioplasty is one such procedure wherein the clinician guides a catheter into the femoral artery under X-rays and the procedure often extends to over 50 min. A clinician performs several hundred such procedures over his/her lifetime, leading to an accumulation of the total radiation he/she is exposed to. In this paper, we investigate autonomous robot-assisted insertion of an active catheter instrumented with shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators using image guidance. The tip of the active catheter is tracked in real time to provide information on the location of the catheter that determines the optimal stroke length of insertion for the robot and the necessary bending angle for the active catheter. The catheter is autonomously guided from the point of entry to the site of plaque buildup, thereby shielding the clinician from harmful radiation due to the X-rays used for imaging and providing a more ergonomic approach for catheter insertion. Experimental results are given to illustrate the robot-assisted catheter insertion procedure using image guidance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598902/","volume":"24","issue":"4","htmlLink":"/document/4598902/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"10144727","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous Image-Guided Robot-Assisted Active Catheter Insertion","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous Image-Guided Robot-Assisted Active Catheter Insertion","sourcePdf":"24tro04-patel.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.135037S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4598893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"4598893","articleId":"4598902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4598903,"authors":[{"name":"Hesheng Wang","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8860/4598893/4598903/4598903-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hesheng Wang (S'05\u2013A'07\u2013M'08) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2002, and the M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees in automation and computer-aided engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Both point and line features are considered. This paper extends the concept of depth-independent interaction (or image Jacobian) matrix, developed in earlier work for visual servoing using point features and fixed cameras, to the problem using eye-in-hand cameras and point and line features. By using the depth-independent interaction matrix, it is possible to linearly parameterize, by the unknown camera parameters and the unknown coordinates of the features, the closed-loop dynamics of the system. A new algorithm is developed to estimate unknown parameters online by combining the Slotine-Li method with the idea of structure from motion in computer vision. By minimizing the errors between the real and estimated projections of the feature on multiple images captured during motion of the robot, this new adaptive algorithm can guarantee the convergence of the estimated parameters to the real values up to a scale. On the basis of the nonlinear robot dynamics, we proved asymptotic convergence of the image errors by the Lyapunov theory. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed controller.","doi":"10.1109/TRO.2008.2001356","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics","pdfPath":"/iel5/8860/4598893/04598903.pdf","startPage":"843","endPage":"857","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TRO.2008.2001356","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598893","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Visual Servoing Using Point and Line Features With an Uncalibrated Eye-in-Hand Camera","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4598903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4598903/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Visual Servoing Using Point and Line Features With an Uncalibrated Eye-in-Hand Camera","volume":"24","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144728","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4598903/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Visual Servoing Using Point and Line Features With an Uncalibrated Eye-in-Hand Camera","sourcePdf":"24tro04-wang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082452S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"8860","isNumber":"4598893","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8860","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"4598893","articleId":"4598903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4598991,"authors":[{"name":"Eva Stoffels","affiliation":["Faculty of Biomedical Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, Eindhoven, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/4598909/4598991/4598991-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Eva Stoffels was born in October 1968 in Warsaw, Poland.

A short interval of over-power operation during the warm-up stage enables the lamp to further enhance the production of luminance quickly and hence greatly reduce the starting transient period.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2008.2001192","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/4598919/04599006.pdf","startPage":"1907","endPage":"1912","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2008.2001192","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598919","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599006","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Acceleration Scenarios of Metal Halide Lamps","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Acceleration Scenarios of Metal Halide Lamps","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599006/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","volume":"36","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599006/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145728","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Acceleration Scenarios of Metal Halide Lamps","sourcePdf":"36tps04-hcheng-pt5.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066544S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"4598919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4598919","articleId":"4599006","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":4599158,"authors":[{"name":"Habti Abeida","affiliation":["D\u00e9partement CITI, Institut Telecom Sud-Paris, Evry, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4599157/4599158/4599158-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Habti Abeida was born in Settat, Morocco, on October 20, 1977.

An explicit closed-form expression of the mean null spectrum of the conventional and noncircular MUSIC algorithms is derived using an analysis based on perturbations of the noise projector instead of those of the eigenvectors. Based on these results, theoretical and approximate interpretable closed-form expressions of the threshold array signal-to-noise ratios (ASNR) at which these two algorithms are able to resolve two closely spaced transmitters along the Cox and the Sharman and Durrani criteria are given. It is proved that the threshold ASNRs given by the conventional MUSIC algorithm do not depend on the distribution of the sources including their noncircularity, in contrast to the noncircular MUSIC algorithm for which they are very sensitive to the noncircularity phase separation of the sources. This threshold ASNR given by the noncircular MUSIC algorithm is proven to be comfortably lower than that given by the conventional MUSIC algorithm except for weak phase separations of the sources for which the resolving powers of these two algorithms are very close. Finally, these results are analyzed through several illustrations and Monte Carlo simulations.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.924143","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.924143","startPage":"4317","endPage":"4329","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4599157/04599158.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Statistical Performance of MUSIC-Like Algorithms in Resolving Noncircular Sources","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Statistical Performance of MUSIC-Like Algorithms in Resolving Noncircular Sources","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","volume":"56","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599158/","accessionNumber":"10144713","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599158/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Statistical Performance of MUSIC-Like Algorithms in Resolving Noncircular Sources","sourcePdf":"56tsp09-abeida.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08453S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4599157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4599157","articleId":"4599158","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-04"},{"_id":4599160,"authors":[{"name":"Bruno Clerckx","affiliation":["Communication and Networking Laboratory, Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, Yongin si, South Korea","Microwave Laboratory, Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4599157/4599160/4599160-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bruno Clerckx received the M.S. degree and the Ph.D. degree in applied science from the Universit\u00e9 Catholique de Louvain (UCL), Louvain-la-Neuve, Belgium, in 2000 and 2005, respectively.

Rayleigh channels (being either slow or fast fading) and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, it has been shown that poor scattering conditions can have detrimental effects on the performance of STCs and that the behavior of codes at high SNR is radically different from the finite SNR behavior. This calls for new design criteria that correctly predict the behavior of codes in correlated channels at finite SNR. In this paper, we investigate how spatially and temporally correlated Ricean fading affects the performance of STCs at finite SNR. We derive a code design criterion leading to robust STCs in a wide variety of propagation conditions and do not require any channel knowledge at the transmitter. Codes satisfying this criterion are shown to perform sensibly better in correlated channels than codes designed only for i.i.d. slow or fast Rayleigh-fading channels. Examples of space-time trellis codes and algebraic codes are proposed in order to illustrate the developed criterion.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.921811","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4599157/04599160.pdf","startPage":"4365","endPage":"4376","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.921811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space\u2013Time Code Design for Correlated Ricean MIMO Channels at Finite SNR","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599160","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599160/","displayDocTitle":"Space\u2013Time Code Design for Correlated Ricean MIMO Channels at Finite SNR","volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10144707","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599160/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space\u2013Time Code Design for Correlated Ricean MIMO Channels at Finite SNR","sourcePdf":"56tsp09-clerckx.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09443S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4599157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4599157","articleId":"4599160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599164,"authors":[{"name":"Bogdan Dumitrescu","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control and Computers, University of Bucharest, Romania"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4599157/4599164/4599164-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bogdan Dumitrescu (M'01) was born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1962.

An open question is whether the local minima of finite sample approximations to such cost functions are close to the minima in the infinite sample case. To answer this question, we develop a new methodology of analyzing the finite sample behavior of general blind source separation cost functions. In particular, we derive a new probabilistic analysis of the rate of convergence as a function of the number of samples and the conditioning of the mixing matrix. The method gives a connection between the number of available samples and the probability of obtaining a local minimum of the finite sample approximation within a given sphere around the local minimum of the infinite sample cost function. This shows the convergence in probability of the nearest local minima of the finite sample approximation to the local minima of the infinite sample cost function. We also answer a long-standing problem of the mean-squared error (MSE) behavior of the (finite sample) least squares constant modulus algorithm (LS-CMA), namely whether there exist LS-CMA receivers with good MSE performance. We demonstrate how the proposed techniques can be used to determine the required number of samples for LS-CMA to exceed a specified performance. The paper concludes with simulations that validate the results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.921721","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4599157/04599169.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.921721","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599157","startPage":"4340","endPage":"4353","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind Source Separation: The Location of Local Minima in the Case of Finitely Many Samples","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Blind Source Separation: The Location of Local Minima in the Case of Finitely Many Samples","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599169/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145735","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4599169/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind Source Separation: The Location of Local Minima in the Case of Finitely Many Samples","sourcePdf":"56tsp09-leshem.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.085945S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4599157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"4599157","articleId":"4599169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4599170,"authors":[{"name":"Antonio G.

Many fundamental tasks in signal processing (e.g., smoothing, denoising, segmentation etc.) require efficient methods for computing (approximate) marginal probabilities over subsets of nodes in the graph. The marginalization problem, though solvable in linear time for graphs without cycles, is computationally intractable for general graphs with cycles. This intractability motivates the use of approximate ldquomessage-passingrdquo algorithms.

For pairwise Markov random fields, we derive various conditions that are sufficient to ensure convergence, and also provide bounds on the geometric convergence rates. When specialized to the ordinary sum-product algorithm, these results provide strengthening of previous analyses. We prove that some of our conditions are necessary and sufficient for subclasses of homogeneous models, but not for general models. The experimental simulations on various classes of graphs validate our theoretical results.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.924136","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4599157/04599175.pdf","startPage":"4293","endPage":"4305","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.924136","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence Analysis of Reweighted Sum-Product Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Convergence Analysis of Reweighted Sum-Product Algorithms","volume":"56","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10173742","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599175/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599175/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence Analysis of Reweighted Sum-Product Algorithms","sourcePdf":"56tsp09-roosta.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0729S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4599157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"4599157","articleId":"4599175","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599178,"authors":[{"name":"Shreyas Sundaram","affiliation":["Coordinated Science Laboratory and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana-Champaign, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4599157/4599178/4599178-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shreyas Sundaram (S'08) received the B.A.Sc. degree in computer engineering from the University of Waterloo, ON, Canada, in 2003 and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2005.

In contrast to convolution that is protected through CRT codes with coprime moduli, our scheme allows errors to be detected and located in a highly parallel manner, and has the advantage of being robust to faults that occur during the error handling stage. In addition, for certain important classes of errors, the codes developed in this paper require less redundancy than CRT codes constructed from coprime moduli. We demonstrate the applicability and advantages of our codes by comparing them to both CRT codes with coprime moduli and repetition codes. We focus on codes over polynomial rings, but our constructions apply naturally to integer codes; we discuss this extension and show that it generalizes the distance properties and error correction strategies associated with previously developed approaches for codes based on non-coprime integer moduli.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.924636","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4599157/04599178.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.924636","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599157","startPage":"4244","endPage":"4254","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Convolution Via Chinese Remainder Codes Constructed From Non-Coprime Moduli","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599178","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Convolution Via Chinese Remainder Codes Constructed From Non-Coprime Moduli","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599178/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145738","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4599178/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-Tolerant Convolution Via Chinese Remainder Codes Constructed From Non-Coprime Moduli","sourcePdf":"56tsp09-sundaram.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12477S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4599157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4599157","articleId":"4599178","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4599179,"authors":[{"name":"Lokesh Bheema Thiagarajan","affiliation":["National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/4599157/4599179/4599179-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lokesh Bheema Thiagarajan (S'06) received the B.

A subspace-based blind estimator is proposed, which only uses the received signal and the desired user's spreading code to estimate the CFO and CIR. The CFO is estimated using a one-dimensional linear search where the objective of the search is to minimize the determinant of a low dimensional matrix and the CIR is estimated as the unit-norm eigenvector corresponding to the minimum eigenvalue of this matrix. The identifiability of the CFO and CIR estimates is investigated by imposing asymptotic constraints on the spreading codes. Although the cost function used by the proposed estimator is nonlinear and nonconvex, it is locally convex in the neighborhood of the true CFO value. This property is used to formulate a simple two-stage CFO estimator. In the first stage, a coarse search is performed to lock into the local convexity region. Then, an adaptive algorithm is used in the second stage to finetune the CFO estimate. The ldquolinearizedrdquo proposed estimator is shown to be unbiased. The simulation results show that the proposed estimator's performance is close to the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB).","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-Data-Aided Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimator for Uplink MC-CDMA Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.923201","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4599157/04599179.pdf","startPage":"4398","endPage":"4408","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.923201","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599157","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599179","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599179/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Non-Data-Aided Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimator for Uplink MC-CDMA Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4599179/","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145739","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-Data-Aided Joint Carrier Frequency Offset and Channel Estimator for Uplink MC-CDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"56tsp09-thiagarajan.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07503S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4599157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"4599157","articleId":"4599179","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":4599181,"authors":[{"name":"Ami Wiesel","affiliation":["Technion\u2014Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Ami","lastName":"Wiesel","id":"37284056000"},{"name":"Yonina C.

The problem of optimizing detection performance with such imperfect communication brings a new challenge to distributed detection. In this paper, sensors are assumed to have independent but nonidentically distributed observations, and a multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) channel model is included to account for imperfect communication between the sensors and the fusion center. The J-divergence between the distributions of the detection statistic under different hypotheses is used as a performance criterion in order to provide a tractable analysis. Optimization of performance with individual and total transmitter power constraints on the sensors is studied, and the corresponding power allocation scheme strikes a tradeoff between two factors, the communication channel quality and the local decision quality. For the case with orthogonal channels, under certain conditions, the power allocation can be solved by a weighted water-filling al.gorithm. Simulations show that the proposed power allocation in certain cases only consumes as little as 25% of the total power used by an equal power allocation scheme while achieving the same performance.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/4599157/04599183.pdf","startPage":"4124","endPage":"4140","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2008.924639","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2008.924639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599157","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599183","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Distributed Detection Over MIMO Channels in Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Wireless sensor networks","Sensor fusion","Sensor systems","Transmitters","Interference","Statistical analysis","Statistical distributions","Performance analysis","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MIMO communication","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication channels","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal power allocation","MIMO channels","wireless sensor networks","distributed detection systems","interference","fusion centers receiver","nonidentically distributed observations","multiple-input-multiple-output channel model","J-divergence","total transmitter power constraints","communication channel quality","local decision quality","orthogonal channels","weighted water-filling algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Distributed detection","multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel","power allocation","wireless sensor networks (WSNs)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599183/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"12 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Power Allocation for Distributed Detection Over MIMO Channels in Wireless Sensor Networks","volume":"56","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4599183/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145742","dateOfInsertion":"12 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Power Allocation for Distributed Detection Over MIMO Channels in Wireless Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"56tsp09-zhang.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114856S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"4599157","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"74","xplore-issue":"4599157","articleId":"4599183","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599190,"authors":[{"name":"Ehsan Maani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/4598831/4599190/4599190-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ehsan Maani (S'05) received the B.S. degree in physics from the Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2004, and the M.

The downlink transmission of multiple video sequences to multiple users over a shared resource-limited wireless channel, however, is a daunting task. Among the many challenges in this area are the time-varying channel conditions, limited available resources, such as bandwidth and power, and the different transmission requirements of different video content. This work takes into account the time-varying nature of the wireless channels, as well as the importance of individual video packets, to develop a cross-layer resource allocation and packet scheduling scheme for multiuser video streaming over lossy wireless packet access networks. Assuming that accurate channel feedback is not available at the scheduler, random channel losses combined with complex error concealment at the receiver make it impossible for the scheduler to determine the actual distortion of the sequence at the receiver. Therefore, the objective of the optimization is to minimize the expected distortion of the received sequence, where the expectation is calculated at the scheduler with respect to the packet loss probability in the channel. The expected distortion is used to order the packets in the transmission queue of each user, and then gradients of the expected distortion are used to efficiently allocate resources across users. Simulations show that the proposed scheme performs significantly better than a conventional content-independent scheme for video transmission. </para>","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/4598831/04599190.pdf","startPage":"1663","endPage":"1671","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4598831","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2008.2001402","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2008.2001402","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599190","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Downlink","Propagation losses","Streaming media","Video sharing","Wireless networks","Video sequences","Time-varying channels","Bandwidth","Scheduling algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cross-layer design, error concealment","H.264/AVC","HSDPA","video streaming","wireless packet scheduling"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Communication Networks","Data Compression","Image Enhancement","Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted","Reproducibility of Results","Sensitivity and Specificity","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","Telemetry","Video Recording"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599190/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Resource Allocation for Downlink Multiuser Video Transmission Over Wireless Lossy Networks","pubMedId":"18713672","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4599190/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"17","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Allocation for Downlink Multiuser Video Transmission Over Wireless Lossy Networks","sourcePdf":"17tip09-emaani-2001402.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069989S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"4598831","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4598831","articleId":"4599190","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":4599218,"authors":[{"name":"Rahul Khanna","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Rahul Khanna (rahul.khanna@intel.com) received his M.S. and P.D. degrees from Columbia University, New York, and is currently a Ph.D. candidate at Oregon State University.

Many of these attacks are silent in nature and cannot be detected by conventional intrusion detection methods such as traffic monitoring, port scanning, or protocol violations. These sophisticated attacks operate under the threshold boundaries during an intrusion attempt and can only be identified by profiling the complete system activity in relation to normal behavior. In this article we discuss a control-theoretic hidden Markov model strategy for intrusion detection using distributed observation across multiple nodes. This model comprises a distributed HMM engine that executes in a randomly selected monitor node and functions as a part of the feedback control engine. This drives the defensive response based on hysteresis to reduce the frequency of false positives, thereby avoiding inappropriate ad hoc responses.","doi":"10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","publicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/7742/4599211/04599218.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MWC.2008.4599218","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599211","startPage":"24","endPage":"33","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Control theoretic approach to intrusion detection using a distributed hidden Markov model","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599218","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Control theoretic approach to intrusion detection using a distributed hidden Markov model","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599218/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10158204","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4599218/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Control theoretic approach to intrusion detection using a distributed hidden Markov model","sourcePdf":"07KHANNA.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044522S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"7742","isNumber":"4599211","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7742","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4599211","articleId":"4599218","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4599219,"authors":[{"name":"Sutharshan Rajasegarar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Melbourne, Australia"],"bio":{"p":["Sutharshan Rajasegarar (r.sutharshan@ee.unimelb.edu.au) received a B.Sc. degree in electronic and telecommunication engineering (with first class honors) in 2002 from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka.

In this context, control laws are often designed according to discrete-time control systems theory and implemented as hard real-time periodic tasks. Standard discrete-time control theory mandates to periodically sample (input) and actuate (output). Depending on how input/output (I/O) operations are performed within the hard real-time periodic task, different control task models can be distinguished. However, existing task models present important drawbacks. They generate task executions prone to violate the periodic control demands, a problem known as sampling and latency jitter, or they impose synchronized I/O operations at each task job execution that produce a constant but artificially long I/O latency. In this paper, the one-shot task model for implementing control systems in embedded multitasking hard real-time platforms is presented. The novel control task model is built upon control theoretical results that indicate that standard control laws can be implemented considering only periodic actuation. Taking advantage of this property, the one-shot task model is shown to remove endemic problems for real-time control systems such as sampling and latency jitters. In addition, it can minimize the harmful effects that long I/O latencies have on control performance. Extensive simulations and real experiments show the feasibility and effectiveness of the novel task model, compared to previous real-time and/or control-based solutions.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel5/9424/4626023/04599237.pdf","startPage":"164","endPage":"174","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","doi":"10.1109/TII.2008.2002702","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2008.2002702","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4626023","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599237","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The One-Shot Task Model for Robust Real-Time Embedded Control Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robust control","Real time systems","Control system synthesis","Delay","Control systems","Sampling methods","Jitter","Microprocessors","Control theory","Multitasking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control engineering computing","discrete time systems","embedded systems","multiprogramming","periodic control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["one-shot task model","real-time embedded control systems","microprocessors","discrete-time control systems","input/output operations","periodic actuation","real-time control systems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aperiodic observer","periodic task model","real-time embedded control systems","sampling and latency jitter"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599237/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"The One-Shot Task Model for Robust Real-Time Embedded Control Systems","volume":"4","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/4599237/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10222494","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The One-Shot Task Model for Robust Real-Time Embedded Control Systems","sourcePdf":"04tii03-pmarti-2002702.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107285S","chronDate":"Aug.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"4626023","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"4626023","articleId":"4599237","onlineDate":"15 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4599240,"authors":[{"name":"Kimmo Jarvinen","affiliation":["Signal Processing Laboratory, Helsinki University of Technology, Finland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/4603036/4599240/4599240-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Kimmo J\u00e4rvinen (S'06) was born in Turku, Finland, in 1979.

Elliptic curve point multiplication, which is the operation used in every elliptic curve cryptosystem, is hierarchical in nature, and parallelism can be utilized in different hierarchy levels as shown in many publications. However, a comprehensive analysis on the effects of parallelization has not been previously presented. This paper provides tools for evaluating the use of parallelism and shows where it should be used in order to maximize efficiency. Special attention is given for a family of curves called Koblitz curves because they offer very efficient point multiplication. A new method where the latency of point multiplication is reduced with parallel field arithmetic processors is introduced. It is shown to outperform the previously presented multiple field multiplier techniques in the cases of Koblitz curves and generic curves with fixed base points. A highly efficient general elliptic curve cryptography processor architecture is presented and analyzed. Based on this architecture and analysis on the effects of parallelization, a few designs are implemented on an Altera Stratix II field-programmable gate array (FPGA).","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000728","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/4603036/04599240.pdf","startPage":"1162","endPage":"1175","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2008.2000728","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4603036","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Parallelization of High-Speed Processors for Elliptic Curve Cryptography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599240/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"On Parallelization of High-Speed Processors for Elliptic Curve Cryptography","volume":"16","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10177448","htmlLink":"/document/4599240/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Parallelization of High-Speed Processors for Elliptic Curve Cryptography","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-jarvinen-2000728.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166245S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"4603036","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"4603036","articleId":"4599240","onlineDate":"15 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4599246,"authors":[{"name":"Yaojiang Zhang","affiliation":["The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/22/4616565/4599246/4599246-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yaojiang Zhang (M'03) received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui, China, in 1991 and 1994, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in physical electronics from Peking University, Beijing, China, In 1999.","From 1999 to 2001, he was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow with Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

These walls can be perfect electric conductor (PEC)/perfect magnetic conductor(PMC) or a nonreflective perfectly matched layer.

Next, by investigating the relationship between outputs and states, the system is transformed into an input-output predictor model, and then, output feedback control is constructed. To overcome the difficulty of nonaffine appearance of the control input, implicit function theorem is exploited in the control design and NN is employed to approximate the unknown function in the control. In both state feedback and output feedback control, only a single NN is used and the controller singularity is completely avoided. The closed-loop system achieves semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness (SGUUB) stability and the output tracking error is made within a neighborhood around zero. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed control approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel5/72/4616503/04599256.pdf","startPage":"1599","endPage":"1614","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doi":"10.1109/TNN.2008.2000446","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNN.2008.2000446","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4616503","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599256","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Predictive Control Using Neural Network for a Class of Pure-Feedback Systems in Discrete Time","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Programmable control","Adaptive control","Predictive control","Neural networks","State feedback","Output feedback","Adaptive systems","Nonlinear control systems","Control systems","Control system synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","discrete time systems","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","predictive control","state feedback"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive predictive control","adaptive neural network control","discrete-time systems","nonlinear pure-feedback systems","state feedback control","output feedback control","semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness stability","output tracking error"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete-time system","neural network","pure-feedback system"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Artificial Intelligence","Computer Simulation","Feedback","Models, Theoretical","Neural Networks (Computer)","Pattern Recognition, Automated","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599256/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Predictive Control Using Neural Network for a Class of Pure-Feedback Systems in Discrete Time","volume":"19","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/4599256/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10185851","pubMedId":"18779091","dateOfInsertion":"03 September 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Predictive Control Using Neural Network for a Class of Pure-Feedback Systems in Discrete Time","sourcePdf":"19tnn00-ge.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082621S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"72","isNumber":"4616503","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"4616503","articleId":"4599256","onlineDate":"15 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4599395,"authors":[{"name":"Srinivas Bangalore","affiliation":["AT and T Laboratories Research, Inc., Florham Park, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Srinivas Bangalore (SM'06) received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, in 1997.","He is currently a Principal Member of Technical Staff in the Voice and IP Services Laboratory, AT&T Labs-Research, Florham Park, NJ, working on speech and language processing including spoken language translation, multimodal understanding, and language generation.

Rich morphology results in large increases in out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate and poor language model parameter estimation in the absence of large quantities of data. In this study, we present a joint morphological-lexical language model (JMLLM) that takes advantage of Arabic morphology. JMLLM combines morphological segments with the underlying lexical items and additional available information sources with regards to morphological segments and lexical items in a single joint model. Joint representation and modeling of morphological and lexical items reduces the OOV rate and provides smooth probability estimates while keeping the predictive power of whole words. Speech recognition and machine translation experiments in dialectal-Arabic show improvements over word and morpheme based trigram language models. We also show that as the tightness of integration between different information sources increases, both speech recognition and machine translation performances improve.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Morphological-Lexical Language Modeling for Processing Morphologically Rich Languages With Application to Dialectal Arabic","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","doi":"10.1109/TASL.2008.924591","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/4599391/04599398.pdf","startPage":"1330","endPage":"1339","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2008.924591","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599391","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599398","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599398/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2008","displayDocTitle":"Joint Morphological-Lexical Language Modeling for Processing Morphologically Rich Languages With Application to Dialectal Arabic","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4599398/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"Sept. 2008","accessionNumber":"10158384","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Morphological-Lexical Language Modeling for Processing Morphologically Rich Languages With Application to Dialectal Arabic","sourcePdf":"16tasl00-sarikaya-924591.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088183S","chronDate":"Sept.  2008","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"4599391","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4599391","articleId":"4599398","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4599423,"authors":[{"name":"Lyle N.

These attacks capture leaking information from an implementation of the algorithm in software or in hardware and apply cryptanalytical and statistical tools to recover the secret keys. A very well-known countermeasure against these attacks is to randomize every execution of the algorithm and every intermediate piece of data with a so-called masking method. In this paper we demonstrate that traditional countermeasures such as masking methodsfor symmetric cryptosystems are completely inefficient against fault attacks. In other words, differential fault attacks still apply on masked data. As an example we show how to recover secret keys from two masked AES implementations using a basic differential fault attack.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599555/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4599555/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10152610","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Masking Does Not Protect Against Differential Fault Attacks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Masking Does Not Protect Against Differential Fault Attacks","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3314a035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.11602S","chronDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599542","isNumber":"4599543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599542","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"4599543","articleId":"4599555","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599556,"authors":[{"name":"Konrad J.

Even devices using a cryptographically secure algorithm may be vulnerable to implementation attacks like side channel analysis or fault attacks. Most fault attacks on RSA concentrate on the vulnerability of the Chinese Remainder Theorem to fault injections. A few other attacks on RSA which do not use this speed-up technique have been published. Nevertheless, these attacks require a quite precise fault injection like a bit flip or target a special operation without any possibility to check if the fault was injected in the intended way, like in safe-error attacks.In this paper we propose a new attack on square and multiply, based on a manipulation of the control flow. Furthermore, we show how to realize this attack in practice using non-invasive spike attacks and discuss impacts of different side channel analysis countermeasures on our attack. The attack was performed using low cost equipment.","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2008.10","publicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599542/4599543/04599557.pdf","startPage":"53","endPage":"58","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2008.10","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Practical Fault Attack on Square and Multiply","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599557/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Practical Fault Attack on Square and Multiply","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152612","htmlLink":"/document/4599557/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Practical Fault Attack on Square and Multiply","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3314a053.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065537S","chronDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599542","isNumber":"4599543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599542","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"4599543","articleId":"4599557","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599558,"authors":[{"name":"Leif Uhsadel","affiliation":["Department ESATS, CD, COSIC, IBBT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Leif","lastName":"Uhsadel","id":"38094579800"},{"name":"Andy Georges","affiliation":["Department ELIS, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium"],"firstName":"Andy","lastName":"Georges","id":"38079784700"},{"name":"Ingrid Verbauwhede","affiliation":["Department ESATS, CD, COSIC, IBBT, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Ingrid","lastName":"Verbauwhede","id":"37274332200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-0-7695-3314-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"4599558","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":587},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Radiation detectors","Noise","Hardware","Kernel","Registers","Driver circuits","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","cryptography","operating systems (computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware performance counter","software project profiling","operating system","security model","cache profiling","cryptography"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["side channel attack","timing attack","cache attack","hardware performance counter"]}],"abstract":"We introduce the usage of hardware performance counters (HPCs) as a new method that allows very precise access to known side channels and also allows access to many new side channels.

They are meant to serve as a relative measure and are most commonly used for profiling software projects or operating systems. Furthermore they are only accessible in restricted mode and can only be accessed by the operating system. We discuss this security model and we show first implementation results, which confirm that HPCs can be used to profile relatively short sequences of instructions with high precision.

However, most of them are tailored to a specific cryptographic algorithm or focus on securing the processed data only. In this work we present a generic and elegant approach by using a highly fault secure algebraic structure. This structure is compatible to finite fields and rings and preserves its error detection property throughout addition and multiplication. Additionally, we introduce a method to generate a fingerprint of the instruction sequence. Thus, it is possible to check the result for data corruption as well as for modifications in the program flow. This is even possible if the order of the instructions is randomized. Furthermore, the properties of the countermeasure allow the deployment of error detection as well as error diffusion. We point out that the overhead for the calculations and for the error checking within this structure is reasonable and that the transformations are efficient. In addition we discuss how our approach increases the security in various kinds of fault scenarios.","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2008.11","publicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599542/4599543/04599559.pdf","startPage":"68","endPage":"73","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2008.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599543","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generic Fault Countermeasure Providing Data and Program Flow Integrity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599559/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"A Generic Fault Countermeasure Providing Data and Program Flow Integrity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152614","htmlLink":"/document/4599559/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generic Fault Countermeasure Providing Data and Program Flow Integrity","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3314a068.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042132S","chronDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599542","isNumber":"4599543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599542","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"4599543","articleId":"4599559","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599560,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Francq","affiliation":["LIRMM-CNRS, University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Francq","id":"37991156100"},{"name":"Jean-Baptiste Rigaud","affiliation":["Ecole desMines deSaint Etienne, Centre Microelectronique deProvence G.

We propose to use the same kind of technique to attack other asymmetric cryptographic schemes. The most interesting case in which we use a somewhat different approach is the attack on Elliptic Curves based signature protocol (namely ECDSA). Here we also take advantage of the short keys to offer a nontrivial practical attack that enables us to fully recover the private key. Different idea is used to attack Guillou-Quisquater authentication scheme (GQ). This demonstrates how the difference between schemes influences the details of the modulus corruption attacks. Special efforts were devoted to calculate the amount of corrupted data to perform the attack on each scheme. Various ways of protection against fault injection attacks on public key elements are discussed.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599543","publicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 5th Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599542/4599543/04599564.pdf","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2008.20","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2008.20","startPage":"108","endPage":"115","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Attacks on Authentication and Signature Schemes Involving Corruption of Public Key (Modulus)","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599564/","displayDocTitle":"Attacks on Authentication and Signature Schemes Involving Corruption of Public Key (Modulus)","htmlLink":"/document/4599564/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10152617","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Attacks on Authentication and Signature Schemes Involving Corruption of Public Key (Modulus)","confLoc":"Washington, DC, USA","sourcePdf":"3314a108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065059S","chronDate":"10-10 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599542","isNumber":"4599543","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599542","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"4599543","articleId":"4599564","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":4599568,"authors":[{"name":"Bijan Ansari","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Bijan","lastName":"Ansari","id":"37296545300"},{"name":"M.

The achievable performance benefit arising out of adopting NoCs is constrained by the performance limitation imposed by the metal wire, which is the physical realization of communication channels. With technology scaling, only depending on the material innovation will extend the lifetime of conventional interconnect systems a few technology generations. According to International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) for the longer term, new interconnect paradigms are in need. The conventional two dimensional (2D) integrated circuit (IC) has limited floor-planning choices, and consequently it limits the performance enhancements arising out of NoC architectures. Three dimensional (3D) ICs are capable of achieving better performance, functionality, and packaging density compared to more traditional planar ICs. On the other hand, NoC is an enabling solution for integrating large numbers of embedded cores in a single die. 3D NoC architectures combine the benefits of these two new domains to offer an unprecedented performance gain. In this paper we evaluate the performance of 3D NoC architectures and demonstrate their superior functionality in terms of throughput, latency, energy dissipation and wiring area overhead compared to traditional 2D implementations.","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.142","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4688917/04599574.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"45","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.142","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4688917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Networks-on-Chip in a Three-Dimensional Environment: A Performance Evaluation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599574/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2009","displayDocTitle":"Networks-on-Chip in a Three-Dimensional Environment: A Performance Evaluation","volume":"58","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2009","accessionNumber":"10324043","htmlLink":"/document/4599574/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"25 November 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Networks-on-Chip in a Three-Dimensional Environment: A Performance Evaluation","sourcePdf":"ttc2009010032.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05324S","chronDate":"Jan.  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4688917","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"334","xplore-issue":"4688917","articleId":"4599574","onlineDate":"15 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-09"},{"_id":4599575,"authors":[{"name":"Tsern-Huei Lee","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4982484/4599575/4599575-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tsern-Huei Lee received the BS degree in electrical engineering from the National Taiwan University, Taipei, in 1981, the MS degree in electrical engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 1984, and the PhD degree in electrical engineering from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1987.

We show that the inductions of the functions needed to construct the G-NFA can be generalized to include other special symbols commonly used in extended regular expressions such as the POSIX 1003.2 format. Our proposed implementation can detect the ending positions of all substrings of an input string T, which start at arbitrary positions of T and belong to the language defined by the given regular expression. To achieve high performance, the implementation is generalized to the NFA, which processes K symbols in each operation cycle. We provide an efficient solution for the boundary condition when the length of the input string is not an integral multiple of K. Compared with previous designs, our proposed architecture is more flexible and programmable because the pattern matching engine uses memory rather than logic.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel5/12/4982484/04599575.pdf","startPage":"984","endPage":"993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","doi":"10.1109/TC.2008.145","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TC.2008.145","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4982484","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599575","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware Architecture for High-Performance Regular Expression Matching","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Pattern matching","Hardware","Automata","Doped fiber amplifiers","Memory management","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite automata","pattern matching"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance regular expression matching","bitmap-based hardware architecture","Glushkov nondeterministic finite automaton","POSIX 1003.2 format","boundary condition","input string","pattern matching engine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Hardware acceleration","nondeterministic finite automaton","regular expression."]},{"kwd":["content inspection","virus signature","regular expression","hardware acceleration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599575/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2009","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 August 2008","displayDocTitle":"Hardware Architecture for High-Performance Regular Expression Matching","volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/4599575/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2009","accessionNumber":"10667216","dateOfInsertion":"27 May 2009","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware Architecture for High-Performance Regular Expression Matching","sourcePdf":"ttc2009070984.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129723S","chronDate":"July  2009","xplore-pub-id":"12","isNumber":"4982484","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4982484","articleId":"4599575","onlineDate":"15 August 2008","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2009","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599577,"authors":[{"name":"Liang-Kai Wang","affiliation":["Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Long Star Design Center, Austin, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/12/4766371/4599577/4599577-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Liang-Kai Wang received the BS degree in electronic engineering from the National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1991, where he focused on audio signal processing for musical instruments.

Due to the growing importance of decimal floating-point (DFP) arithmetic, the IEEE 754-2008 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754-2008) includes specifications for DFP arithmetic. IBM recently announced adding DFP instructions to their POWER6, z9, and z10 microprocessor architectures. As processor support for DFP arithmetic emerges, it is important to investigate efficient arithmetic algorithms and hardware designs for common DFP arithmetic operations. This paper gives an overview of DFP arithmetic in IEEE 754-2008 and discusses previous research on decimal fixed-point and floating-point addition. It also presents novel designs for a DFP adder and a DFP multifunction unit (DFP MFU) that comply with IEEE 754-2008. To reduce their delay, the DFP adder and MFU use decimal injection-based rounding, a new form of decimal operand alignment, and a fast flag-based method for rounding and overflow detection. Synthesis results indicate that the proposed DFP adder is roughly 21 percent faster and 1.6 percent smaller than a previous DFP adder design, when implemented in the same technology. Compared to the DFP adder, the DFP MFU provides six additional operations, yet only has 2.8 percent more delay and 9.7 percent more area.

Many organizations implement TRM as an ongoing effort. In that case, organizations need to assure that all activities related to TRM implementation are seamlessly integrated with other existing business processes. The consequences of TRM implementation can possibly lead to some changes in the business process, organization structure, or even working culture. Applying change management approach will help organizations to understand the basic elements which an individual needs so that some challenges can be addressed in advance before adopting the technology roadmapping process. This paper proposes a practical guideline to implement technology roadmapping by applying the concept of change management approach. A case example is also included in this paper to present how the subject organization applied change management approach to overcome challenges and limitations occurring during TRM implementation process. The contribution of this paper is to enrich the existing body of knowledge of technology roadmapping with a practical framework to guide practitioners, whom plan to implement TRM processes in their organizations.","displayPublicationTitle":"PICMET '08 - 2008 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591409/4599598/04599834.pdf","startPage":"2134","endPage":"2140","publicationTitle":"PICMET '08 - 2008 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","doi":"10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599834","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599834","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599834","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Applying change management approach to guide the implementation of technology roadmapping (TRM)","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line measurements","Organizations","Business","Companies","Conferences","Gain","Strategic planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["management of change","strategic planning","technological forecasting","technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["change management","technology roadmapping","strategic planning","business process","organization structure","working culture"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599834/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Applying change management approach to guide the implementation of technology roadmapping (TRM)","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599834/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10146324","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"27-31 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Applying change management approach to guide the implementation of technology roadmapping (TRM)","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"233_08A0186.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047611S","chronDate":"27-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4591409","isNumber":"4599598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591409","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"4599598","articleId":"4599834","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET (Portland Intl Conf on Management)IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4599835,"authors":[{"name":"Hitoshi Abe","affiliation":["Japan Techno-Economics Society, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Hitoshi Abe","id":"37086900356"},{"name":"Akihiko Suzuki","affiliation":["Chubu Electric Power Co., Inc., Midori-ku, Nagoya, Japan"],"lastName":"Akihiko Suzuki","id":"37086904912"},{"name":"Minoru Etoh","affiliation":["NTT DoCoMo, Inc., Yokosuka-shi, Kanagawa, Japan"],"lastName":"Minoru Etoh","id":"37086902148"},{"name":"Shigeki Sibagaki","affiliation":["Nitta Corporation, Yamatokohriyama-shi, Nara, Japan"],"lastName":"Shigeki Sibagaki","id":"37086902636"},{"name":"Shunichi Koike","affiliation":["Tokyo Gas Co., Ltd., Arakawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Shunichi Koike","id":"37086902314"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-890843-17-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-890843-18-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-5100"}],"articleNumber":"4599835","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":334},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Technological innovation","Business","Companies","Fuel cells","Biological system modeling","Cities and towns","Africa"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["innovation management","product development","technological forecasting","technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["systematic innovation methods","innovation support technology","business modeling","innovation architecture","technology management","strategic roadmapping","product development plans","resource management","business development","technology development"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes an enhanced version of Innovation Support Technology (IST) which we have been proposing as a Management Of Technology (MOT) framework, the IST that provides engineers a set of systematic tools for product/service innovation.

An implementation of the IST may contain iterative refinements between the business modeling and the strategic roadmapping so as to produce a complete plan of business and technology development. The enhanced version, which we propose here, incorporates with a formal method called ldquoinnovation architecturerdquo proposed and developed by H. Tschirky group of ETH Zurich, which has the key elements called ldquofunctions.rdquo It can enhance the above-mentioned IST implementation to be more systematic and systemic.

An improvement in management methods for reinforcing R&D capabilities is an urgent concern for any technology-based enterprise. Among many studies of new management theories and methodologies, technology roadmapping, for consideration of future prospects, has come into the spotlight. The Japanese Government released a report entitled \"Strategic Technology Roadmap\" in 2005, and has been attempting to diffuse roadmapping, by reviewing roadmaps annually in collaboration with academia and industry. However, responses by major Japanese chemical companies to our inquiries indicated that they are reluctant to adopt technology roadmapping, although they are interested in the concept . The reasons for this hesitation are: doubts about the results, complicated explanations about the procedures to be employed, and lots of time required to come up with effective plans. Thus, referring to Rogers' theory of \"Diffusion of Innovation\", we have proposed a \"simplified half-day course\" as a customized roadmapping method, by combining the conventional roadmapping method with KJ method, which is already popular among researchers in Japanese companies, as an idea creation method. Some workshops, with around 100 researchers involved, have been conducted in the corporate laboratories of a major Japanese chemical company to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. It has been confirmed that the new method is a useful tool for strategic mid-term R&D planning.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The development of simplified technology roadmapping for use by Japanese chemical companies","publicationTitle":"PICMET '08 - 2008 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","doi":"10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599836","displayPublicationTitle":"PICMET '08 - 2008 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591409/4599598/04599836.pdf","startPage":"2150","endPage":"2158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599836","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599836","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599836/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"The development of simplified technology roadmapping for use by Japanese chemical companies","conferenceDate":"27-31 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599836/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10146326","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The development of simplified technology roadmapping for use by Japanese chemical companies","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"235_08A0176.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074472S","chronDate":"27-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4591409","isNumber":"4599598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591409","xplore-issue":"4599598","articleId":"4599836","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET (Portland Intl Conf on Management)IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4599837,"authors":[{"name":"Yuya Kajikawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yuya Kajikawa","id":"37587915900"},{"name":"Yoshiyuki Takeda","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Yoshiyuki Takeda","id":"37668092400"},{"name":"Katsumori Matsushima","affiliation":["Graduate School of Engineering, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan"],"lastName":"Katsumori Matsushima","id":"37334631200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-890843-17-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-890843-18-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-5100"}],"articleNumber":"4599837","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuel cells","Photovoltaic cells","Cities and towns","Africa","Forecasting","Petroleum","Aquaculture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided engineering","expert systems","fuel cells","production engineering computing","research and development management","solar cells","technological forecasting","technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer-assisted roadmapping","energy research","science and technology roadmaps","R&D management","technological research","scientific research","expert-based approach","fuel cell","solar cell"]}],"abstract":"Science and technology (S&T) roadmaps are an attractive tool in R&D management, and have been widely used during the past decade. S&T roadmaps are typically constructed by gathering and stimulating expert's opinion. In these days, the planner of S&T research has to grasp the broader coverage of scientific and technological research, and make decisions on effective investment in promising and emerging technologies especially under circumstances of limited resources. In such a situation, roadmapping is time-consuming and subjective, and therefore computer-based approach is expected to supplement expert-based approach. In this paper, we proposed and demonstrated that the computer-based approach using citation network analysis can be used to depict technology trend, and build the first draft of S&T roadmaps. We perform a case study in energy research. We track emerging research domains in it by citation network analysis. Our analysis confirms that the fuel cell and solar cell are rapidly growing domains in energy research. We further investigate the detailed research structures by clustering. Each citation cluster has characteristic research topics, and there is a variety of growth trends among the clusters. By using citation network analysis, we can track emerging research domains among a pile of publications efficiently and effectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-assisted roadmapping: A case study in energy research","publicationTitle":"PICMET '08 - 2008 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","doi":"10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599837","displayPublicationTitle":"PICMET '08 - 2008 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering & Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/4591409/4599598/04599837.pdf","startPage":"2159","endPage":"2164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PICMET.2008.4599837","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599598","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599837","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599837/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 July 2008","displayDocTitle":"Computer-assisted roadmapping: A case study in energy research","conferenceDate":"27-31 July 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599837/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"July 2008","accessionNumber":"10146327","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-assisted roadmapping: A case study in energy research","confLoc":"Cape Town, South Africa","sourcePdf":"236_08R0197.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080452S","chronDate":"27-31 July 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4591409","isNumber":"4599598","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4591409","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4599598","articleId":"4599837","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET (Portland Intl Conf on Management)","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4599905,"authors":[{"name":"I.

Primary users must be guaranteed a premium service rate, measured by their signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR); secondary users, if admitted, should be provided with at least a basic service rate, and the number of admitted secondary users should be maximized. The problem is NP-hard, but drawing upon recent results for joint beamforming and admission control for the cellular downlink, an efficient convex approximation algorithm is derived that yields close to optimal results at affordable complexity. The key step is a reformulation of the joint problem that naturally leads to a linear programming relaxation. Simulation results are included to illustrate the merits of the approach. Two scenarios are considered: with or without a primary user. In the latter, several good heuristic algorithms are available in the literature, and the prevalent one is used as a baseline. A brute- force enumeration algorithm is used in both cases to assess the gap to the optimal solution.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599905/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"10152636","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599905/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Convex Approximation-Based Joint Power and Admission Control for Cognitive Underlay Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convex Approximation-Based Joint Power and Admission Control for Cognitive Underlay Networks","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"01-01-01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065356S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4599905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599911,"authors":[{"name":"Guowang Miao","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Guowang","lastName":"Miao","id":"37411059000"},{"name":"Ye Li","affiliation":["School of ECE, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA"],"firstName":"Ye","lastName":"Li","id":"37279890200"},{"name":"Nageen Himayat","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Nageen","lastName":"Himayat","id":"37355694700"},{"name":"Shilpa Talwar","affiliation":["Communication Technology Laboratory, Intel Corporation, USA"],"firstName":"Shilpa","lastName":"Talwar","id":"37323366400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4599911","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":117},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599911","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Interference","Signal to noise ratio","Throughput","Gain","Interchannel interference","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cochannel interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MAC","medium access control scheme","wireless cellular networks","cost-effective cochannel interference avoidance","CIA","cross-layer design"]}],"abstract":"Severe cochannel interference in wireless cellular networks significantly affects users at cell edges. We propose a cost-effective cochannel interference avoidance (CIA) medium access control (MAC) scheme to improve network performance. For CIA-MAC, base stations judged as severe interferers transmit randomly and transmission is controlled by wireless channel states to optimize the overall network performance while maintaining proportional fairness amongst users. The conditions for triggering CIA-MAC are derived and two simple trigger mechanisms are obtained. The CIA-MAC scheme requires low signalling overhead and only minor changes to the existing mobile systems. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme, CIA-MAC, significantly outperforms traditional networks through avoidance of severe cochannel interference as well as exploitation of multiuser diversity through cross-layer design.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.12","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04599911.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"67","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cochannel Interference Avoidance MAC in Wireless Cellular Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cochannel Interference Avoidance MAC in Wireless Cellular Networks","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4599911/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10145172","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599911/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cochannel Interference Avoidance MAC in Wireless Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"01-01-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07434S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4599911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-16"},{"_id":4599918,"authors":[{"name":"Wassim El-Hajj","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, UAE"],"firstName":"Wassim","lastName":"El-Hajj","id":"38241546300"},{"name":"Fadi Aloul","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, American University of Sharjah, UAE"],"firstName":"Fadi","lastName":"Aloul","id":"37267050700"},{"name":"Zouheir Trabelsi","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, UAE"],"firstName":"Zouheir","lastName":"Trabelsi","id":"37296071000"},{"name":"Nazar Zaki","affiliation":["College of Information Technology, United Arab Emirates University, UAE"],"firstName":"Nazar","lastName":"Zaki","id":"37827383800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4599918","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":464},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fuzzy logic","Subspace constraints","Intrusion detection","Fuzzy systems","Computers","Engines","Sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy control","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["port scanning","network intrusion detection system","fuzzy logic controller"]}],"abstract":"Intrusion detection is a mechanism used to detect various attacks on a wired or wireless network. Port scanning is one of the dangerous attacks that intrusion detection tries to detect. Snort, a famous network intrusion detection system (NIDS), detects a port scanning attack by combining and analyzing various traffic parameters. Because these parameters cannot be easily combined using a mathematical formula, fuzzy logic can be used to combine them; fuzzy logic can also reduce the number of false alarms. This paper presents a novel approach, based on fuzzy logic, to detect port scanning attacks. A fuzzy logic controller is designed and integrated with Snort in order to enhance the functionality of port scanning detection. Experiments are carried out in both wired and wireless networks. The results show that applying fuzzy logic adds to the accuracy of determining bad traffic. Moreover, it gives a level of degree for each type of port scanning attack.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.19","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04599918.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.19","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","startPage":"105","endPage":"110","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Detecting Port Scanning using Fuzzy Based Intrusion Detection System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On Detecting Port Scanning using Fuzzy Based Intrusion Detection System","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599918/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152645","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","htmlLink":"/document/4599918/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On Detecting Port Scanning using Fuzzy Based Intrusion Detection System","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"01-02-07.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050248S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4599918","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":4599924,"authors":[{"name":"Hamid M.

In this paper, four fixed resource allocation schemes with different partition and reuse factors are discussed. They are 7-part partitioning (PF7), 4-part partitioning (PF4), partial reuse (PR), and full reuse (FR) schemes. The co-channel interferences of these four schemes in a multi-cell scenario are full-queue analyzed. Through the use of a proposed Monte-Carlo simulation algorithm, the empirical cumulative density function (CDF) curves of user's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the worst case are gained in different scenarios. Simulation results show that multihop transmissions are greatly advantageous for improving throughput and reducing outage when compared with single-hop transmissions, and can especially improve the performance of cell-edge users. Among these four schemes, PF7 and PF4 mitigate co-channel interferences by relay-channel partitioning, while the other two schemes PR and FR improve the throughput by relay-channel partitioning as well as reuse.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.31","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04599930.pdf","startPage":"177","endPage":"182","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.31","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance Improvement through Relay-Channel Partitioning and Reuse in OFDMA Multihop Cellular Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599930","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599930/","displayDocTitle":"Performance Improvement through Relay-Channel Partitioning and Reuse in OFDMA Multihop Cellular Networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152656","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599930/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance Improvement through Relay-Channel Partitioning and Reuse in OFDMA Multihop Cellular Networks","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"01-04-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086057S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4599930","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599935,"authors":[{"name":"Xinghui Su","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xinghui","lastName":"Su","id":"37589203900"},{"name":"Tiejun Lv","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Tiejun","lastName":"Lv","id":"37267189000"},{"name":"Ping Gong","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ping","lastName":"Gong","id":"37597601100"},{"name":"Xiang Yun","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiang","lastName":"Yun","id":"37664307200"},{"name":"Shaoshi Yang","affiliation":["Department of Information Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Shaoshi","lastName":"Yang","id":"37598425500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4599935","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Indexes","Multiplexing","Capacity planning","Frequency division multiplexing","Interference","Spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","statistical multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["user index updating","Latin square hopping pattern","downlink cellular system","statistical multiplexing","multigroup frequency hopping OFDMA"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the multi-group frequency hopping OFDMA (MG-FH OFDMA) based on the statistical multiplexing is proposed for the downlink cellular system.

By dividing all users into different groups, the subcarriers are utilized sufficiently. Latin Square hopping pattern and user index updating scheme are applied to randomize the subcarrier collisions among users. The user capacity, defined as the maximum number of users served with a basic data-rate in a cell, is calculated with the consideration of intra-cell capacity and the other cell interference (OCI).

Also, we derive sufficient conditions for a real-number solution to be optimal and develop an efficient algorithm to find a near-optimal integer solution. The effectiveness of the integer solution is demonstrated by showing that its gap with the optimal solution is small. We show by experiments that the proposed predictive method has a sufficient accuracy when there are many active users in cells.

The MIMO physical layer provides a number of degrees of freedom that a correct protocol design could exploit to the network's advantage. To illustrate this point, we compare two approaches. The first is fixed shortest path forwarding, with routes computed a priori. The second involves a dynamic relay choice based on a specific metric. This metric has been designed to yield an overall assessment of the relay's ability to forward packets. A key point of our design lies in its cross- layer nature, that allows to harvest the advantages coming from the interaction of the physical layer and the upper layers. To this end, we propose here a technique to track the receive capabilities of eligible forwarders so as to avoid that they become overloaded and unable to demultiplex superimposed waveforms. We carry out a detailed performance evaluation to assess the improvements provided by our solution with respect to the baseline shortest path routing protocol, and conclude that a standard design paradigm, that splits routing and lower-level protocols, severely limits performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Design of Routing Protocols for MIMO Ad Hoc Networks under Uniform and Correlated Traffic","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.48","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04599947.pdf","startPage":"273","endPage":"278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.48","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599947","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599947/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"On the Design of Routing Protocols for MIMO Ad Hoc Networks under Uniform and Correlated Traffic","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599947/","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152673","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Design of Routing Protocols for MIMO Ad Hoc Networks under Uniform and Correlated Traffic","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"01-07-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085655S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4599947","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4599959,"authors":[{"name":"Jeong-Wook Seo","affiliation":["Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jeong-Wook","lastName":"Seo","id":"37292427600"},{"name":"Youn-Sung Lee","affiliation":["Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Youn-Sung","lastName":"Lee","id":"37560079100"},{"name":"Hyun-Sik Kim","affiliation":["Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun-Sik","lastName":"Kim","id":"37716226500"},{"name":"Jong-Ho Paik","affiliation":["Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Ho","lastName":"Paik","id":"37302255300"},{"name":"Seok-Pil Lee","affiliation":["Korea Electronics and Technology Institute, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seok-Pil","lastName":"Lee","id":"37407208800"},{"name":"Minho Jo","affiliation":["School of Information and Communication Eng, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Minho","lastName":"Jo","id":"37065234800"},{"name":"Dong-Ku Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Eng, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Dong-Ku","lastName":"Kim","id":"37279322500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4599959","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":159},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Resource management","Antennas","Estimation","Electronic mail","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","error statistics","least mean squares methods","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision-directed LMMSE channel estimation","OFDM transmit diversity","linear minimum mean square error","maximum ratio combining-based decision directed technique","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","subcarrier allocation","Alamouti-coded data locations","bit error rate"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes an linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) channel estimator with maximum ratio combining-based decision directed (MRC-DD) technique to increase spectral efficiency in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmit diversity. For Alamouti's transmit diversity, pilot symbols are exclusively allocated in two OFDM symbols on different antennas. This results in serious degradation of spectral efficiency. The proposed subcarrier allocation scheme uses repetition-coded data symbols to reduce the number of pilot symbols. The proposed channel estimator consists of an MRC-DD channel estimator and an LMMSE channel estimator. The MRC-DD channel estimator performs a two-step estimation procedure to obtain more accurate CFR estimates at the repetition-coded data locations: the first coarse LMMSE step and the second fine DD step. Then, the final LMMSE channel estimator gives the CFR estimates at the Alamouti-coded data locations. Simulation results show that the proposed channel estimator provides as good bit error rate performance as the conventional LMMSE channel estimator using more pilot symbols, whereas it improves spectral efficiency more than the conventional one.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.60","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04599959.pdf","startPage":"344","endPage":"347","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MRC-Based Decision-Directed LMMSE Channel Estimation for Efficient OFDM Transmit Diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599959/","displayDocTitle":"MRC-Based Decision-Directed LMMSE Channel Estimation for Efficient OFDM Transmit Diversity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152626","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599959/","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MRC-Based Decision-Directed LMMSE Channel Estimation for Efficient OFDM Transmit Diversity","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"01-09-04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081442S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4599959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":4599969,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Tian","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Tian","id":"38088272600"},{"name":"Dongfeng Yuan","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Dongfeng","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37276438900"},{"name":"Quanquan Liang","affiliation":["School of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University, Jinan, China"],"firstName":"Quanquan","lastName":"Liang","id":"37398591500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4599969","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":589},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Forward error correction","Energy efficiency","Distance measurement","Wireless sensor networks","Error correction","Payloads","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic repeat request","broadcast channels","data communication","forward error correction","telecommunication control","telecommunication network reliability","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy efficiency analysis","error control schemes","wireless sensor networks","multi-hop structure","broadcast channel","data transmission","automatic repeat request","forward error correction"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599969","abstract":"Multi-hop structure and broadcast channel of wireless sensor networks necessitate error control schemes to achieve reliable data transmission. The energy efficiency of error control schemes should be considered because of the strict energy constraints of wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor networks require simple and facile error control schemes because of the low complexity request of sensor nodes. Automatic repeat request (ARQ) and forward error correction (FEC) are the key error control strategies in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we discuss these error control schemes using energy efficiency analysis. We prove that energy efficiency of ARQ technique is independent of retransmission attempts and is unchangeable with the number of retransmission. The result of our analysis reveals that there is an optimum FEC scheme with the maximal energy efficiency for a target communication distance and packet size. The optimum FEC scheme is presented in this paper. In addition, ARQ is compared with FEC in terms of energy efficiency based on different communication distances and packet lengths.","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.70","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04599969.pdf","startPage":"401","endPage":"405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Efficiency Analysis of Error Control Schemes in Wireless Sensor Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Efficiency Analysis of Error Control Schemes in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","accessionNumber":"10152635","publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599969/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599969/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Efficiency Analysis of Error Control Schemes in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"01-11-06.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066694S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"28","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4599969","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":4599971,"authors":[{"name":"Saurav K.

Among multicarrier communication techniques, the combination of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology with multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems is very effective for high data rate wireless communication. In this paper, we propose a cross layer optimization technique for transmitting H.264/AVC video data over a MIMO-OFDM wireless channel. A set of fast time-varying and frequency selective fading channels is considered. The channel is assumed to be unchanged for the duration of one OFDM block and change independently from one OFDM block to the other. The number of pilot symbols for each OFDM block is held constant and they are dispersed throughout the block for efficient channel estimation. The video transmission system uses a jointly optimal space frequency (SF) code design and pilot placement scheme. Rate compatible punctured convolutional (RCPC) codes are used for channel protection. The problem formulation selects the set of source and channel coding rates along with the optimal pilot placement for a total bit rate constraint. The performance of the optimal power allocation case is compared with the equal power distribution case. At the transmitter, we have developed a method for the estimation of the video distortion at the receiver for given channel conditions. The accuracy of this method is validated using experimental results. Computer simulation results are shown for a 2 x 2 MIMO-OFDM system but the results can be extended to MIMO-OFDM systems with any number of transmit and receive antennas.","displayPublicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/4599898/4599899/04599971.pdf","startPage":"413","endPage":"418","publicationTitle":"2008 International Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference","doi":"10.1109/IWCMC.2008.72","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IWCMC.2008.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=4599899","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=4599971","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimization for H.264/AVC Video Transmission Over Space-Frequency (SF) Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Resource management","Channel coding","Automatic voltage control","Channel estimation","Wireless communication","Source coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","fading channels","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer optimization","video transmission","space-frequency coded MIMO-OFDM systems","multicarrier communication","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","multiple input multiple output","frequency selective fading channels","rate compatible punctured convolutional codes"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/4599971/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Optimization for H.264/AVC Video Transmission Over Space-Frequency (SF) Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/4599971/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2008","accessionNumber":"10152677","dateOfInsertion":"15 August 2008","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Optimization for H.264/AVC Video Transmission Over Space-Frequency (SF) Coded MIMO-OFDM Systems","confLoc":"Crete, Greece","sourcePdf":"01-12-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050373S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2008","xplore-pub-id":"4599898","isNumber":"4599899","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"4599898","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"4599899","articleId":"4599971","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2008","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":4599979,"authors":[{"name":"Kyu-Sung Hwang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Kyu-Sung","lastName":"Hwang","id":"37403878000"},{"name":"Young-Chai Ko","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Korea University, Seoul, Korea"],"firstName":"Young-Chai","lastName":"Ko","id":"37279007700"},{"name":"Mohamed-Slim Alouini","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Program, Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ) Education City, Doha, Qatar"],"firstName":"Mohamed-Slim","lastName":"Alouini","id":"37274291900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-2202-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-2201-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2376-6492"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2376-6506"}],"articleNumber":"4599979","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","Relays","Signal to noise ratio","Fading","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Protocols","Upper bound"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive modulation","diversity reception","Nakagami channels","probability","protocols","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental relaying transmission","adaptive QAM transmission","quadrature amplitude modulation","Nakagami-m fading channels","cooperative network","amplify-and-forward transmission","relaying protocol","outage probability","cooperative diversity","adaptive modulation"]}],"abstract":"Cooperative network is a way to make a reliable communication by adding a relay between the source and the destination.
