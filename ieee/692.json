The connectivity of the secondary network is further analysed with the continuum percolation theory. Given the critical density of the secondary network without the impact of PUs, the critical density of the secondary network coexisting with PUs is estimated analytically.

Each user is associated with a user-centric cluster of BSs; the central processor shares the user's data with the BSs in the cluster, which then cooperatively serve the user through joint beamforming. Under this setup, this paper investigates the user scheduling, BS clustering, and beamforming design problem from a network utility maximization perspective. Differing from previous works, this paper explicitly considers the per-BS backhaul capacity constraints. We formulate the network utility maximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two different models depending on whether the BS clustering for each user is dynamic or static over different user scheduling time slots. In the former case, the user-centric BS cluster is dynamically optimized for each scheduled user along with the beamforming vector in each time-frequency slot, whereas in the latter case, the user-centric BS cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user scheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul constraints. In both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints are approximated using the reweighted \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sub>\n-norm technique. This approximation allows us to reformulate the per-BS backhaul constraints into weighted per-BS power constraints and solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem through a generalized weighted minimum mean square error approach. This paper shows that the proposed dynamic clustering algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over existing naive clustering schemes. This paper also proposes two heuristic static clustering schemes that can already achieve a substantial portion of the gain.","doi":"10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2362860","publicationTitle":"IEEE Access","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Access","pdfPath":"/iel7/6287639/6705689/06920005.pdf","startPage":"1326","endPage":"1339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6705689","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2362860","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sparse Beamforming and User-Centric Clustering for Downlink Cloud Radio Access Network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920005","topic":"Recent Advances in Cloud Radio Access Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2014","displayDocTitle":"Sparse Beamforming and User-Centric Clustering for Downlink Cloud Radio Access Network","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920005/","isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14753578","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920005/","volume":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Huawei Technologies Canada Co., Ltd., Ottawa, ON, Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Sparse Beamforming and User-Centric Clustering for Downlink Cloud Radio Access Network","sourcePdf":"access-yu-2362860-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.127116S","chronDate":"2014","xplore-pub-id":"6287639","isNumber":"6705689","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6287639","citationCount":"260","xplore-issue":"6705689","topics":["Recent Advances in Cloud Radio Access Networks"],"articleId":"6920005","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6920007,"authors":[{"name":"Zhengqian Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China"],"bio":{"p":["Zhengqian Luo (M\u201911) was born in Hubei, China, in 1982.

A new hybrid switched reactive-based visual servo control structure, inspired from a sensing-and-reaction behavior without the inverse interaction matrix computing, is proposed to handle this problem efficiently. The proposed structure is similar to the logic-based approaches, but the requirements of the fuzzy modeling and/or the fuzzy-rule base learning are omitted. To achieve this, a novel hardware-aware reactive function approach is presented to directly map an image position error vector to a desired end-effector velocity vector under the consideration of hardware limitations. This approach helps to simplify the implementation of visual servo systems with improved reliability. Moreover, the proposed control system is a hybrid switching controller consisting of both image-based and position-based reactive planning schemes, which allows improving the robustness and effectiveness of the visual servo system. Experimental results validate the performance of the proposed visual servo control method in a realistic scenario setting.","doi":"10.1109/JSYST.2014.2358876","publicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Systems Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4267003/7053977/06920015.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"130","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2014.2358876","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7053977","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Switched Reactive-Based Visual Servo Control of 5-DOF Robot Manipulators for Pick-and-Place Tasks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920015/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Switched Reactive-Based Visual Servo Control of 5-DOF Robot Manipulators for Pick-and-Place Tasks","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6920015/","accessionNumber":"14965213","volume":"9","issue":"1","publicationDate":"March 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Council of China"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Switched Reactive-Based Visual Servo Control of 5-DOF Robot Manipulators for Pick-and-Place Tasks","sourcePdf":"jsyst-wong-2358876-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071982S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"4267003","isNumber":"7053977","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4267003","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"7053977","articleId":"6920015","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6920021,"authors":[{"name":"Yongseok Choi","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Yongseok","lastName":"Choi","id":"37085368080"},{"name":"Jaehwan Joo","affiliation":["Samsung Electronics, Suwon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehwan","lastName":"Joo","id":"37085340814"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6920021","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":1038},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920021","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Encoding","Estimation","Computational complexity","Filtering","Video compression","Streaming media"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive codes","computational complexity","data compression","parameter estimation","video coding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SAO parameter estimation","complexity reduction","SAO encoding policies","video encoders","computational complexity","video encoding process","coding tree unit","coding efficiency","video compression standard","in-loop filter","adaptive offset encoding policies","HEVC/H.265"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["H.265","high efficiency video coding (HEVC)","in-loop filter","sample adaptive offset (SAO)","video compression"]}],"abstract":"A new in-loop filter, sample adaptive offset (SAO) allows the latest video compression standard, HEVC or H.265, to achieve higher coding efficiency both in objective and subjective measures.

To reduce the labeling effort of the user, this paper presents a novel active learning (AL) method to drive RF for retrieving remote sensing images from large archives in the framework of the support vector machine classifier. The proposed AL method is specifically designed for CBIR and defines an effective and as small as possible set of relevant and irrelevant images with regard to a general query image by jointly evaluating three criteria: uncertainty; diversity; and density of images in the archive. The uncertainty and diversity criteria aim at selecting the most informative images in the archive, whereas the density criterion goal is to choose the images that are representative of the underlying distribution of data in the archive. The proposed AL method assesses jointly the three criteria based on two successive steps. In the first step, the most uncertain (i.e., ambiguous) images are selected from the archive on the basis of the margin sampling strategy. In the second step, the images that are both diverse (i.e., distant) to each other and associated to the high-density regions of the image feature space in the archive are chosen from the most uncertain images. This step is achieved by a novel clustering-based strategy. The proposed AL method for driving the RF contributes to mitigate problems of unbalanced and biased set of relevant and irrelevant images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed AL method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Active Learning Method in Relevance Feedback for Content-Based Remote Sensing Image Retrieval","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2358804","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7001732/06920022.pdf","startPage":"2323","endPage":"2334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2358804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001732","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920022","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920022/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Active Learning Method in Relevance Feedback for Content-Based Remote Sensing Image Retrieval","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"53","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6920022/","dateOfInsertion":"08 January 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"14847931","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Product Feature extraction and Analysis (PFA)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Active Learning Method in Relevance Feedback for Content-Based Remote Sensing Image Retrieval","sourcePdf":"tgrs-demir-2358804-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078646S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7001732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7001732","articleId":"6920022","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6920023,"authors":[{"name":"Liang Feng","affiliation":["Center for Computational Intelligence, School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4235/7283685/6920023/feng-2362558-small.gif","p":["Liang Feng received the B.S. degree from the School of Telecommunication and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, China, in 2009.

Many advanced EAs have relied on the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge as inductive biases that is deemed to fit the problem of interest well. As such, the embedment of domain knowledge about the underlying problem within the search algorithms is becoming an established mode of enhancing evolutionary search performance. In this paper, we present a study on evolutionary memetic computing paradigm that is capable of learning and evolving knowledge meme that traverses different but related problem domains, for greater search efficiency. Focusing on combinatorial optimization as the area of study, a realization of the proposed approach is investigated on two NP-hard problem domains (i.e., capacitated vehicle routing problem and capacitated arc routing problem). Empirical studies on well-established routing problems and their respective state-of-the-art optimization solvers are presented to study the potential benefits of leveraging knowledge memes that are learned from different but related problem domains on future evolutionary search.","doi":"10.1109/TEVC.2014.2362558","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary

While node deployment in 2-D terrestrial wireless sensor networks has been extensively studied, little attention has been received by their 3-D counterparts. This paper aims at analyzing the impacts of node deployment strategies on localization performances in a 3-D environment. More specifically, the simulations conducted in this paper reveal that the regular tetrahedron deployment scheme outperforms the random deployment scheme and the cube deployment scheme in terms of reducing localization error and increasing localization ratio while maintaining the average number of neighboring anchor nodes and network connectivity. Given the fact that random deployment is the primary choice for most of practical applications to date, our results are expected to shed some light on the design of UASNs in the near future.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920033/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","accessionNumber":"14914457","htmlLink":"/document/6920033/","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of Deployment Strategies on Localization Performance in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Qing Lan Project"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China","grantNumber":"BK20131137"},{"fundingName":"Applied Basic Research Program of the Nantong Science and Technology Bureau","grantNumber":"BK2013032"},{"fundingName":"Educational Commission of Guangdong Province China Project","grantNumber":"2013KJCX0131"},{"fundingName":"2013 Special Fund of Guangdong Higher School Talent Recruitment"},{"fundingName":"Instituto de Telecomunicaes"},{"fundingName":"Next Generation Networks and Applications Group (NetGNA)"},{"fundingName":"Covilh\u00e3 Delegation, and in part by National Funding from the FCT-Funda\u00e7\u00e3o para a Ci\u00eancia e a Tecnologia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impacts of Deployment Strategies on Localization Performance in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks","sourcePdf":"tie-han-2362731-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089155S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7035183","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"7035183","articleId":"6920033","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6920036,"authors":[{"name":"Chengshan Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University, Tianjin, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5165411/7361791/6920036/wang-2360877-small.gif","p":["Chengshan Wang (SM\u201911) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 1991.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Electrical Engineering and Automation, Tianjin University.

New power modules based on such technology are especially required to allow fast switching of power devices in the extended junction temperature range. This paper describes the major technical challenges involved in sufficiently improving the thermal stress reliability of the critical package systems in SiC power modules and in markedly reducing internal parasitic inductance. Thermal stress reliabilities of the die attachment system, wire bonding system, and encapsulant system are successfully improved, all of which are shown to be able to achieve common life targets: 1) 3000 h for a storage test at 250 \u00b0C and 2) 3000 cycles for thermal cycling between -40 \u00b0C and 250 \u00b0C. A novel phase-leg power module capable of substantially reducing the loop inductance along the principal current tracks is proposed and fabricated by applying SiC-JFETs, SiC-Schottky barrier diodes, and the above-mentioned reliable thermal stress package systems. Double pulse switching testing of the module reveals smaller drain-source voltage spikes and ringing even in turn-ON and turn-OFF transients at very high slew rates of current and voltage. Finally, a 0.34 L forced-air-cooled dc 600 V input ac 50 Hz 400 V 25 kW output three-phase SiC inverter is fabricated using three-phase leg modules and its operation is demonstrated at high-power levels.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2014.2359978","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel7/16/7015642/06920039.pdf","startPage":"258","endPage":"269","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2014.2359978","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7015642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Junction Temperature and Low Parasitic Inductance Power Module Technology for Compact Power Conversion Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920039","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920039/","displayDocTitle":"High Junction Temperature and Low Parasitic Inductance Power Module Technology for Compact Power Conversion Systems","volume":"62","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14866622","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920039/","dateOfInsertion":"20 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Green IT Project through the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization, Kawasaki, Japan"},{"fundingName":"Research and Department Partnership through the Future Power Electronics Technology, Minato, Japan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Junction Temperature and Low Parasitic Inductance Power Module Technology for Compact Power Conversion Systems","sourcePdf":"ted-tanimoto-2359978-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11975S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"7015642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"7015642","articleId":"6920039","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6920049,"authors":[{"name":"Ming Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ming","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37538040500"},{"name":"Xiaolin Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xiaolin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37279342000"},{"name":"Ling Zhao","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ling","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37085520701"},{"name":"Chen Lee","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085506345"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6920049","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1232},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920049","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decoding","Iterative decoding","Random access memory","Scheduling","Manganese","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","computational complexity","convergence of numerical methods","design engineering","iterative decoding","message passing","parity check codes","turbo codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-throughput QC-LDPC decoder design","TDMP scheduling","low-density parity-check codes","turbo-decoding message-passing scheduling","high convergence rates","minsum algorithm","complexity reduction","hybrid normalized MS algorithm","quasicyclic LDPC code","code length","parallel degree optimization","offset iterative sequence rule","data correlation problem","memory access conflicts","90-nm 1-poly 9-metal CMOS process","multimode 96000-bit irregular QC-LDPC decoder"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["QC-LDPC decoder","TDMP scheduling","MS algo-rithm","parallel degree","iterative sequence","decoder architecture"]},{"kwd":["Decoder architecture","iterative sequence","min\u2013sum (MS) algorithm","parallel degree","quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) decoder","turbo-decoding message-passing (TDMP) scheduling"]}],"abstract":"Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes with turbodecoding message-passing (TDMP) scheduling can obtain good performance and high convergence rates.

For a quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) code with a long code length, parallel degree optimization and an offset iterative sequence rule are proposed. With the proposed techniques, the data correlation problem and memory access conflicts during TDMP scheduling can be resolved so that the iteration can smoothly proceed through the reasonable division of each block row.

However, because the prior latency reduction approaches for SC decoders are not applicable for SCL decoders, these list decoders suffer from the long-latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a multibit-decision approach that can significantly reduce latency of SCL decoders. First, we present a reformulated SCL algorithm that can perform intermediate decoding of 2 b together. The proposed approach, referred as 2-bit reformulated SCL (2b-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the latency of SCL decoder from (3n-2) to (2n-2) clock cycles without any performance loss. Then, we extend the idea of 2-b-decision to general case, and propose a general decoding scheme that can perform intermediate decoding of any 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</sup>\n bits simultaneously. This general approach, referred as 2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</sup>\n-bit reformulated SCL (2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K</sup>\n b-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the overall decoding latency to as short as n/2\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">K-2</sup>\n-2 cycles. Furthermore, on the basis of the proposed algorithms, very large-scale integration architectures for 2b-rSCL and 4b-rSCL decoders are synthesized. Compared with a prior SCL decoder, the proposed (1024, 512) 2b-rSCL and 4b-rSCL decoders can achieve 21% and 60% reduction in latency, 1.66 and 2.77 times increase in coded throughput with list size 2, and 2.11 and 3.23 times increase in coded throughput with list size 4, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2359793","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7274516/06920050.pdf","startPage":"2268","endPage":"2280","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274516","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2359793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Latency Successive-Cancellation List Decoders for Polar Codes With Multibit Decision","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920050","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Low-Latency Successive-Cancellation List Decoders for Polar Codes With Multibit Decision","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920050/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15475042","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920050/","volume":"23","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Broadcom Corporation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Latency Successive-Cancellation List Decoders for Polar Codes With Multibit Decision","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-yuan-2359793-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115931S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7274516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"72","xplore-issue":"7274516","articleId":"6920050","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6920051,"authors":[{"name":"Im\u00e8ne Trigui","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Telecommunications, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Im\u00e8ne","lastName":"Trigui","id":"37391799000"},{"name":"Sofi\u00e8ne Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Telecommunications, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Sofi\u00e8ne","lastName":"Affes","id":"37085411209"},{"name":"Alex St\u00e9phenne","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Telecommunications, Montreal, QC, Canada"],"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"St\u00e9phenne","id":"37294239900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2162-2337"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2162-2345"}],"articleNumber":"6920051","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":469},"abstract":"In this letter, we analyze the ergodic capacity of a two-hop multiple-antenna amplify and forward (AF) system, where the relay is subject to co-channel interference (CCI) while the destination is corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) only.

These transformations map performance-annotated software architecture models into stochastic models solved by analytical means or by simulation. However, so far, a detailed quantitative evaluation of the accuracy and efficiency of different transformations is missing, making it hard to select an adequate transformation for a given context. This paper provides an in-depth comparison and quantitative evaluation of representative model transformations to, e.g., queueing petri nets and layered queueing networks. The semantic gaps between typical source model abstractions and the different analysis techniques are revealed. The accuracy and efficiency of each transformation are evaluated by considering four case studies representing systems of different size and complexity. The presented results and insights gained from the evaluation help software architects and performance engineers to select the appropriate transformation for a given context, thus significantly improving the usability of model transformations for performance prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920061/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb. 1 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6920061/","dateOfInsertion":"10 February 2015","publicationDate":"1 Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14915206","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"41","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Quantitative Evaluation of Model-Driven Performance Analysis and Simulation of Component-Based Architectures","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004807","fundingName":"DFG"},{"fundingName":"Collaborative Research Center \u201cOn-The-Fly Computing\u201d","grantNumber":"SFB 901"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100004807","fundingName":"DFG","grantNumber":"KO 3445/6-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantitative Evaluation of Model-Driven Performance Analysis and Simulation of Component-Based Architectures","sourcePdf":"tse-brosig-2362755-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128313S","chronDate":"Feb. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"32","isNumber":"7038242","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"32","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"7038242","articleId":"6920061","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6920064,"authors":[{"name":"Shraddha Srivastava","affiliation":["Department of Physical Therapy, University of Delaware, Newark, DE, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7333/7321076/6920064/6920064-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shraddha Srivastava received the Bachelors and Masters degrees in physical therapy from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprasth University, Delhi, India.

This paradigm encourages subjects' active participation during training. Previous pilot studies demonstrated that assist-as-needed robot-aided gait training (RAGT) improves treadmill walking performance post-stroke. However, it is not known if there is an over-ground transfer of the training effects from RAGT on treadmill or long-term retention of the effects. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effects of assist-as-needed RAGT on over-ground walking pattern post-stroke. Nine stroke subjects received RAGT with visual feedback of each subject's instantaneous ankle malleolus position relative to a target template for 15 40-minute sessions. Clinical evaluations and gait analyses were performed before, immediately after, and 6 months post-training. Stroke subjects demonstrated significant improvements and some long-term retention of the improvements in their self-selected over-ground walking speed, Dynamic Gait Index, Timed Up and Go, peak knee flexion angle during swing phase and total hip joint excursion over the whole gait cycle for their affected leg . These preliminary results demonstrate that subjects improved their over-ground walking pattern and some clinical gait measures post-training suggesting that assist-as-needed RAGT including visual feedback may be an effective approach to improve over-ground walking pattern post-stroke.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920064/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6920064/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2015","publicationDate":"Nov. 2015","accessionNumber":"15583835","pubMedId":"25314703","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Assist-as-Needed Robot-Aided Gait Training Improves Walking Function in Individuals Following Stroke","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000002","fundingName":"National Institutes of Health"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Assist-as-Needed Robot-Aided Gait Training Improves Walking Function in Individuals Following Stroke","sourcePdf":"tnsre-srivastava-2360822-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.144786S","chronDate":"Nov.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7333","isNumber":"7321076","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7333","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"7321076","articleId":"6920064","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-29"},{"_id":6920065,"authors":[{"name":"Hae Young Rha","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hae Young","lastName":"Rha","id":"38246433300"},{"name":"Chun Ju Youn","affiliation":["Department of Photonic/Wireless Convergence Components Research, Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Chun Ju","lastName":"Youn","id":"37587113100"},{"name":"Byoung Goo Jeon","affiliation":["Department of Physics, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Byoung Goo","lastName":"Jeon","id":"38253928700"},{"name":"Hae-Wook Choi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hae-Wook","lastName":"Choi","id":"38247635700"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1041-1135"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0174"}],"articleNumber":"6920065","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":603},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Photonics Society","url":"http://www.PhotonicsSociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Timing","Optical fibers","Signal to noise ratio","Optical noise","Optical transmitters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","Fourier transform optics","OFDM modulation","optical fibre communication","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient chromatic dispersion precompensation","coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","short-cyclic-prefix CO-OFDM","timing offset","full band inverse discrete Fourier transformations","IDFT","subcarrier-based phase rotation","single-channel transmission","single-mode-fiber","polarization division multiplexing 16 quadrature amplitude modulation","PDM-16 QAM","DFT","guard interval"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Chromatic dispersion","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","optical fiber communication"]},{"kwd":["Chromatic dispersion","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","optical fiber communication"]}],"abstract":"To reduce the guard interval, short-cyclic-prefix coherent optical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (CO-OFDM) divides a band into two subbands and precompensates for chromatic dispersion (CD) with timing offset. Implementation using full band inverse discrete Fourier transformations (IDFTs), however, can excessively increase hardware complexity. We propose an efficient hardware implementation of IDFT with timing offsets for short-cyclic-prefix CO-OFDM. In addition, the residual intersubband CD induced by quantized timing offset is compensated using subcarrier-based phase rotation. By increasing the number of subbands efficiently and compensating for the residual intersubband CD, the transmission performance can be improved.

Among the available relays, only those that receive the signals reliably participate in the cooperative beamforming process and use network coding to simultaneously transmit the weighted signals to the transceivers. Two practical two-way relaying strategies are investigated, namely, DF- xoring and DF-superposition. The former is based on bitwise-level xoring of the detected signals at the relays, whereas the latter is based on symbolwise-level addition at the relays. For each relaying strategy, we derive general optimal beamforming vectors at the relays to keep the interference inflicted on the primary receivers to a predefined threshold. Employing zero-forcing beamforming as a special case, we present an analytical framework of the performance of the secondary system considering the effect of the primary-secondary mutual cochannel interference (CCI). In particular, we derive closed-form expressions for the outage probability, bit error rate (BER), and achievable sum rates over independent and identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of beamforming in compensating for the cognitive system performance loss due to CCI in addition to mitigating the interference to the primary receivers. Simulation results also show that, when the received signals at the relays are equally weighted, DF- xor always outperforms both DF-superposition and amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920068/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"64","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","accessionNumber":"15456557","htmlLink":"/document/6920068/","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Beamforming for Two-Way DF Relay Cognitive Networks Under Primary\u2013Secondary Mutual Interference","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Priorities Research Program","grantNumber":"09-126-2-054"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Beamforming for Two-Way DF Relay Cognitive Networks Under Primary\u2013Secondary Mutual Interference","sourcePdf":"tvt-ghrayeb-2362571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118646S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7268796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7268796","articleId":"6920068","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6920071,"authors":[{"name":"Rachid Behdad","affiliation":["Laboratoire d\u2019Electronique, Informatique et Image, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne, Dijon, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7206790/6920071/behda-2360072-small.gif","p":["Rachid Behdad received the Engineering degree in electronics from the University of Tizi-Ouzou, Tizi Ouzou, Algeria, in 2010, and the M.S. degree in electronic and automatic signal from the University of Burgundy, Dijon, France, in 2011.","His current research interests include neuronal models and electronic systems."]},"firstName":"Rachid","lastName":"Behdad","id":"37085377212"},{"name":"St\u00e9phane Binczak","affiliation":["Laboratoire d\u2019Electronique, Informatique et Image, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne, Dijon, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7206790/6920071/bincz-2360072-small.gif","p":["St\u00e9phane Binczak received the Ph.D. degree from the University of Burgundy, Dijon, France, in 1999.","He has been an Associate Professor with the University of Burgundy since 2000, where he became a Full Professor in 2009, and is also a member of the Nonlinear Systems Group with the Laboratory of Electronics, Computer Sciences and Imaging, UMR CNRS 6306.

In addition, two nonzero voltage vectors are selected from the cost function at every sampling period, instead of using only one optimal vector during one sampling period. The two selected nonzero vectors are distributed in one sampling period in such a way as to minimize the error between the measured load current and the reference. Without utilizing the zero vectors, the common-mode voltage controlled by the proposed RCMV-MPC algorithms can be restricted within \u00b1Vdc/6. Furthermore, application of the two nonzero vectors with optimal time sharing between them can yield satisfactory load current ripple performance without using the zero vectors.

Substation automation is a key enabling technology for online monitoring, diagnosis, and prediction for the health condition of the substation assets. Circuit breakers (CBs) are one of the most vital components in a substation for the tripping action required during fault occurrence, line isolation, and other similar actions. It is critical to ensure that the CB is in healthy state and can operate as expected. Enhanced automation and availability of various CB measurements make it possible to continuously monitor the health of all the components within a CB, including the trip coil assembly (TCA). This paper presents the development of a new real-time diagnosis algorithm that runs at a substation and continuously monitors the health condition of a CB TCA and suggests maintenance actions, if necessary. The developed algorithm detects the abnormalities, finds their root causes, and predicts the possibility of potential health problems for the CB TCA. Additionally, the monitoring architecture also allows remote access of data for engineering access. Finally, the results obtained by the online implementation of the proposed algorithm using industry-grade CB and substation data have been presented.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Circuit breakers","Coils","Real-time systems","Assembly","Monitoring","Resistance","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit breakers","fault diagnosis","maintenance engineering","substations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["real-time data-driven algorithm","health diagnosis","health prognosis","circuit breaker trip assembly","trip coil assembly","TCA","CB","substation","maintenance actions"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Circuit breaker trip coil","fault diagnostics and prognostics","real time data driven monitoring and diagnosis","engineering applications in industrial electronic equipments","real time diagnostic techniques"]},{"kwd":["Circuit breaker (CB) trip coil (TC)","engineering applications in industrial electronic equipment","fault diagnostics and prognostics","real-time data-driven monitoring and diagnosis","real-time diagnostic techniques"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2362498","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7104192/06920077.pdf","startPage":"3822","endPage":"3831","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7104192","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2362498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Real-Time Data-Driven Algorithm for Health Diagnosis and Prognosis of a Circuit Breaker Trip Assembly","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Real-Time Data-Driven Algorithm for Health Diagnosis and Prognosis of a Circuit Breaker Trip Assembly","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920077/","volume":"62","issue":"6","publicationDate":"June 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920077/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15111625","dateOfInsertion":"08 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Schweitzer Engineering Laboratory"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Real-Time Data-Driven Algorithm for Health Diagnosis and Prognosis of a Circuit Breaker Trip Assembly","sourcePdf":"tie-srivastava-2362498-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054675S","chronDate":"June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7104192","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"36","xplore-issue":"7104192","articleId":"6920077","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6920079,"authors":[{"name":"Christoph Sommer","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Paderborn, Paderborn, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7116677/6920079/somme-small.gif","p":["Christoph Sommer is an Assistant Professor (AkadR a.Z.) at the\n University of Paderborn, where he joined the Distributed Embedded Systems Group in 2014.

Recent research indicates that beaconing, i.e., one hop message broadcast, shows excellent characteristics and can outperform other communication approaches for both safety and efficiency applications, which require low latency and wide area information dissemination, respectively. To mitigate the broadcast storm problem, adaptive beaconing solutions have been proposed and designed. We show how shadowing dynamics of moving obstacles hurt IVC, reducing the performance of beaconing protocols. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies on identifying the problem and the underlying challenges and proposing the opportunities presented by such challenges. Shadowing also limits the risk of overloading the wireless channel. We demonstrate how these challenges and opportunities can be taken into account and outline a novel approach to dynamic beaconing. It provides low-latency communication (i.e., very short beaconing intervals), while ensuring not to overload the wireless channel. The presented simulation results substantiate our theoretical considerations.","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2014.2362752","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7116677/06920079.pdf","startPage":"1411","endPage":"1421","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7116677","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2014.2362752","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How Shadowing Hurts Vehicular Communications and How Dynamic Beaconing Can Help","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920079","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"How Shadowing Hurts Vehicular Communications and How Dynamic Beaconing Can Help","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920079/","publicationDate":"1 July 2015","dateOfInsertion":"02 June 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15250558","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920079/","volume":"14","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How Shadowing Hurts Vehicular Communications and How Dynamic Beaconing Can Help","sourcePdf":"tmc-dressler-2362752-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129596S","chronDate":"July 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7116677","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"7116677","articleId":"6920079","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6920081,"authors":[{"name":"Walter M.

In addition to the three known FET electrodes the fourth acts as an electric select signal that dynamically programs the desired polarity. The transistor consists of two independent charge carrier injection valves as realized by two gated Schottky junctions integrated within an intrinsic silicon nanowire. The transport properties that provide unipolar n- and p-type behavior will be elucidated. Further, solutions to the major device challenges toward the implementation of these novel transistors at the circuit level are proposed, by exploiting specific nanowire geometries and dimensions. These include methods that deliver equal on-currents and symmetric transfer characteristics for n- and p-type, and that eliminate supra-linear output characteristics at low source-drain biases. We will further show that circuits built of these symmetric transistors successfully exhibit complementary operation. Finally, the prospects in building reconfigurable circuits and systems will be briefly summarized.","doi":"10.1109/TNANO.2014.2362112","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNANO.2014.2362112","startPage":"1020","endPage":"1028","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Nanotechnology","pdfPath":"/iel7/7729/6949178/06920081.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reconfigurable Nanowire Electronics-Enabling a Single CMOS Circuit Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920081/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Reconfigurable Nanowire Electronics-Enabling a Single CMOS Circuit Technology","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 November 2014","accessionNumber":"14720720","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6920081/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001659","fundingName":"Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)"},{"fundingName":"ReproNano","grantNumber":"WE4853/1-2 and MI 1247/6-1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reconfigurable Nanowire Electronics-Enabling a Single CMOS Circuit Technology","sourcePdf":"tnano-weber-2362112-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094666S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7729","isNumber":"6949178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7729","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6949178","articleId":"6920081","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6920083,"authors":[{"name":"Hua Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/6949180/6920083/li-2360893-small.gif","p":["Hua Li received the B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST), Wuhan, China, in 2004 and 2007, respectively.","She is currently an Associate Professor with the State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, HUST."]},"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Li","id":"37579177000"},{"name":"Zhiwei Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/6949180/6920083/zli-2360893-small.gif","p":["Zhiwei Li received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2010, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree."]},"firstName":"Zhiwei","lastName":"Li","id":"37962904900"},{"name":"Zhijian Xu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/6949180/6920083/xu-2360893-small.gif","p":["Zhijian Xu received the B.E. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the M.E. degree."]},"firstName":"Zhijian","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085370007"},{"name":"Fuchang Lin","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Advanced Electromagnetic Engineering and Technology, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/27/6949180/6920083/lin-2360893-small.gif","p":["Fuchang Lin was born in Zhejiang, China, in 1969.

Automatic demographic estimation, particularly age estimation, remains a challenging problem because persons belonging to the same demographic group can be vastly different in their facial appearances due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors. In this paper, we present a generic framework for automatic demographic (age, gender and race) estimation. Given a face image, we first extract demographic informative features via a boosting algorithm, and then employ a hierarchical approach consisting of between-group classification, and within-group regression. Quality assessment is also developed to identify low-quality face images that are difficult to obtain reliable demographic estimates. Experimental results on a diverse set of face image databases, FG-NET (1K images), FERET (3K images), MORPH II (75K images), PCSO (100K images), and a subset of LFW (4K images), show that the proposed approach has superior performance compared to the state of the art. Finally, we use crowdsourcing to study the human perception ability of estimating demographics from face images. A side-by-side comparison of the demographic estimates from crowdsourced data and the proposed algorithm provides a number of insights into this challenging problem.","doi":"10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2362759","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel7/34/7101897/06920084.pdf","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2362759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7101897","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Demographic Estimation from Face Images: Human vs. Machine Performance","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920084","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 1 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920084/","displayDocTitle":"Demographic Estimation from Face Images: Human vs. Machine Performance","volume":"37","issue":"6","publicationDate":"1 June 2015","accessionNumber":"15420133","pubMedId":"26357339","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920084/","dateOfInsertion":"05 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Demographic Estimation from Face Images: Human vs. Machine Performance","sourcePdf":"tpami-han-2362759-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.270034S","chronDate":"June 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"34","isNumber":"7101897","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"176","xplore-issue":"7101897","articleId":"6920084","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-31"},{"_id":6920086,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaoming Chen","affiliation":["College of Electronic and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6940343/6920086/6920086-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xiaoming Chen (M'10\u2013SM'14) received his B.Sc. degree from Hohai University in 2005, M.Sc. degree from Nanjing University of Science and Technology in 2007 and Ph.D. degree from Zhejiang University in 2011, all in electronic engineering.

In this paper, we conduct a unified performance analysis for physical layer security with incomplete CSI, and derives closed-form expressions of ergodic secrecy rate, secrecy outage probability, and interception probability, considering CSI estimation accuracy, transmit signal to noise ratio (SNR), and channel condition.

The training algorithms are least-square Levenberg-Marquardt (LSLM) and recursive least-square algorithm with forgetting factor (RLSFF). The performances of these algorithms are assessed based on their generalization capability in relating the fault current parameters with an event of fault in the transmission line. The proposed algorithm is fast in response as it utilizes postfault samples of three phase currents measured at the relaying end corresponding to half-cycle duration only. After being trained with only a small part of the generated fault data, the algorithms have been tested over a large number of fault cases with wide variation of system and fault parameters. Based on the studies carried out in this paper, it has been found that although the RLSFF algorithm is faster for training the ChNN in the fault classification application for series compensated transmission lines, the LSLM algorithm has the best accuracy in testing. The results prove that the proposed ChNN-based method is accurate, fast, easy to design, and immune to the level of compensations. Thus, it is suitable for digital relaying applications.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2360879","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7514298/06920088.pdf","startPage":"1631","endPage":"1642","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2360879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7514298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Fault Classification in Series Compensated Transmission Line: Comparative Evaluation of Chebyshev Neural Network Training Algorithms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920088/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Improved Fault Classification in Series Compensated Transmission Line: Comparative Evaluation of Chebyshev Neural Network Training Algorithms","volume":"27","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"15 July 2016","accessionNumber":"16141439","pubMedId":"25314714","publicationDate":"Aug. 2016","htmlLink":"/document/6920088/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Fault Classification in Series Compensated Transmission Line: Comparative Evaluation of Chebyshev Neural Network Training Algorithms","sourcePdf":"tnnls-vyas-2360879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.111849S","chronDate":"Aug.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7514298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"7514298","articleId":"6920088","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-23"},{"_id":6920089,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Kurz","affiliation":["Department of Statistics, University of Klagenfurt, Klagenfurt, Austria"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8856/7000614/6920089/6920089-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Daniel Kurz received a M.S. degree in technical mathematics with a main focus on statistics from the Alpen-Adria-University (AAU), Klagenfurt, Austria, in 2012, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree in statistics.","He has been involved in research topics from the semiconductor industry since 2010.

With the need of highly reliable processes, the semiconductor industry aims at developing methodologies covering the gap of missing metrology information. Virtual Metrology turns out to be a promising method; it aims at predicting wafer and/or site fine metrology results in real time and free of costs. In this paper, we present a sampling decision system that relies on virtual measurements suggesting an efficient strategy for measuring productive wafers. Several methods for evaluating when a real measurement is needed (including the expected utility of measurement information, a two-stage sampling decision model and wafer quality risk values) are proposed. We further provide ideas on how to assess and update the reliability of the virtual measurements in a sampling decision system (whenever real measurements become available). In this context, we introduce equipment health factors and virtual trust factors for improving the reliability of the sampling decision system. Finally, the performance of the sampling decision system is demonstrated on a set of virtual and real metrology data from the semiconductor industry. It is shown that wafer measurements are efficiently performed when really needed.","doi":"10.1109/TASE.2014.2360214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASE.2014.2360214","startPage":"75","endPage":"83","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/8856/7000614/06920089.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7000614","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Sampling Decision System for Virtual Metrology in Semiconductor Manufacturing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Sampling Decision System for Virtual Metrology in Semiconductor Manufacturing","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"31 December 2014","volume":"12","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920089/","accessionNumber":"14835993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920089/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Sampling Decision System for Virtual Metrology in Semiconductor Manufacturing","sourcePdf":"tase-kurz-2360214-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078311S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8856","isNumber":"7000614","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8856","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7000614","articleId":"6920089","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6920090,"authors":[{"name":"Tom Torfs","affiliation":["imec, body area networks department, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6949172/6920090/6920090-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tom Torfs received the B.S. degree in electronics engineering from KIH De Nayer, St. Katelijne Waver, Belgium, and the M.S. degree in engineering\u2013biomedical technology from KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium, 2001 and 2010, respectively.","He has worked at imec, Leuven, Belgium, since 2001 as a Systems Researcher and Architect, designing compact wireless autonomous systems based around imec wireless, sensor and packaging technologies, with a focus on sensors for biomedical applications and body area networks.

A heuristic optimization based approach is proposed with the aim of achieving a desirable performance under multiple contingencies with respect to a reference short-term voltage response. Based on a pre-selected set of credible contingencies and potential candidate locations for device additions, the approach employs the mean-variance mapping optimization (MVMO) in combination with an integrated mixed-integer search strategy (IMIS) and two intervention schemes, to accelerate and guide the search process towards a techno-economically optimum solution. The first intervention is performed at fitness evaluation stage to screen economic solutions which entail technical feasibility and to reduce computational effort. IMIS and the second intervention is concerned with MVMO's knowledge management, which facilitates the search for solutions comprising a small number of devices with relatively large VAr capacity.

The microgrid planning problem investigates the economic viability of microgrid deployment and determines the optimal generation mix of distributed energy resources (DERs) for installation. Net metering is considered for exchanging power with the main grid and lowering the cost of unserved energy and DER investments. A robust optimization approach is adopted for considering forecast errors in load, variable renewable generation, and market prices. The microgrid islanding is further treated as a source of uncertainty. The microgrid planning problem is decomposed into an investment master problem and an operation subproblem. The optimal planning decisions determined in the master problem are employed in the subproblem to examine the optimality of the master solution by calculating the worst-case optimal operation under uncertain conditions. Optimality cuts sent to the master problem will govern subsequent iterations. Numerical simulations exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed model and further analyze the sensitivity of microgrid planning results on variety levels of uncertainty.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2361094","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7161453/06920097.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2014.2361094","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7161453","startPage":"2417","endPage":"2425","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microgrid Planning Under Uncertainty","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920097","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Microgrid Planning Under Uncertainty","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920097/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"30","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15305861","dateOfInsertion":"17 July 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6920097/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microgrid Planning Under Uncertainty","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-khodaei-2361094-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074884S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"7161453","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"198","xplore-issue":"7161453","articleId":"6920097","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6920104,"authors":[{"name":"Supatcha Chaimatanan","affiliation":["MAIAA Laboratory, \u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Supatcha","lastName":"Chaimatanan","id":"37085501431"},{"name":"Daniel Delahaye","affiliation":["MAIAA Laboratory, \u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Delahaye","id":"37326349800"},{"name":"Marcel Mongeau","affiliation":["MAIAA Laboratory, \u00c9cole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile, Toulouse, France"],"firstName":"Marcel","lastName":"Mongeau","id":"37424757100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1556-603X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1556-6048"}],"articleNumber":"6920104","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":766},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Logistics","Production management","Air traffic control","Optimization ","Trajectory","Aircraft safety"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["air safety","air traffic control","aircraft control","integer programming","path planning","strategic planning","trajectory optimisation (aerospace)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid metaheuristic optimization algorithm","4D aircraft trajectory","global air-traffic demand","strategic trajectory planning methodology","European-continent scale","aircraft position uncertainty","horizontal plane","route-departure-time assignment problem","mixed-integer optimization problem","large trajectory sets","European airspace"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920104","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/10207/6920102/06920104.pdf","startPage":"46","endPage":"61","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MCI.2014.2350951","doi":"10.1109/MCI.2014.2350951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920102","publicationTitle":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithm for Strategic Planning of 4D Aircraft Trajectories at the Continental Scale","abstract":"Global air-traffic demand is continuously increasing. To handle such a tremendous traffic volume while maintaining at least the same level of safety, a more efficient strategic trajectory planning is necessary. In this work, we present a strategic trajectory planning methodology which aims to minimize interaction between aircraft at the European-continent scale. In addition, we propose a preliminary study that takes into account uncertainties of aircraft positions in the horizontal plane. The proposed methodology separates aircraft by modifying their trajectories and departure times. This route/departure-time assignment problem is modeled as a mixed-integer optimization problem. Due to the very high combinatorics involved in the continent-scale context (involving more than 30,000 flights), we develop and implement a hybrid-metaheuristic optimization algorithm. In addition, we present a computationally-efficient interaction detection method for large trajectory sets. The proposed methodology is successfully implemented and tested on a full-day simulated air traffic over the European airspace, yielding to an interaction-free trajectory plan.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920104/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","volume":"9","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14651904","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6920104/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithm for Strategic Planning of 4D Aircraft Trajectories at the Continental Scale","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Metaheuristic Optimization Algorithm for Strategic Planning of 4D Aircraft Trajectories at the Continental Scale","sourcePdf":"09mci04-chaimatanan-2350951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.088342S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10207","isNumber":"6920102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10207","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6920102","articleId":"6920104","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6920114,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Hua Zhou","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, Nanjing, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Hua","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37085505703"},{"name":"Nitesh V.

To multiplex antennas, the delay and phase coded slots on a LCX is proposed. Different code is assigned to every LCX-MIMO antenna. In the paper, the configuration of an LCX-MIMO system, theoretical analysis and design methods are described. Analytical results and simulation calculation are performed on the relationship between code length and antenna size, as well as the multi access interference among LCX-MIMO antennas. Also the symbol error rate is estimated for various tip length and symbol durations. From the results of this analysis, it is shown that the proposed LCX-MIMO antenna system does not degrade system performance compared to conventional multiple feeder system. The proposed system makes it easy to set MIMO antennas over a wide area, and the MIMO multiplexing order can be improved.","doi":"10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920260","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913606/6920251/06920260.pdf","startPage":"6","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920260","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of LCX-MIMO antenna system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920260","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920260/","displayDocTitle":"Performance of LCX-MIMO antenna system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14664917","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920260/","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of LCX-MIMO antenna system","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1569949743.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058073S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913606","isNumber":"6920251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913606","xplore-issue":"6920251","articleId":"6920260","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6920262,"authors":[{"name":"Mitsuhito Iwamoto","affiliation":["Graduate School of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Mitsuhito","lastName":"Iwamoto","id":"37085517398"},{"name":"Shingo Matsuoka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Shingo","lastName":"Matsuoka","id":"37085501348"},{"name":"Hiroki Iwasaki","affiliation":["Graduate School of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroki","lastName":"Iwasaki","id":"37085512779"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Otsuka","affiliation":["Graduate School of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, Kogakuin University, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Otsuka","id":"37396597400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3711-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3710-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920262","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":842},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920262","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bit error rate","OFDM","Encoding","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Signal to noise ratio","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","error statistics","OFDM modulation","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission performance","OFDM","1024-QAM","EVM degradation","error vector magnitude","higher order modulation scheme","256--QAM","spectral efficiency","channel quality","BER","link adaptation perspective","EVM","resource management","mobile systems","small cell enhancement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","256-QAM","1024-QAM","EVM","Link level simulation","BER","Link adaptation","Small cell enhancement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920262","startPage":"12","endPage":"16","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913606/6920251/06920262.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920262","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920251","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission performance of OFDM with 1024-QAM in the presence of EVM degradation","abstract":"This paper presents error vector magnitude (EVM) impact on the transmission performance of OFDM using a higher order modulation scheme such as 256- and 1024-QAM by link-level simulations.

capacity performance analysis of pico-cells and macro-cells in multiple-input multiple-output heterogeneous LTE-Advanced networks. The analysis makes use of state-of-the-art 3D ray-tracing for a large number of pico and macro-cell base station and user locations. A baseband 2\u00d72 MIMO LTE-A link level simulator via 3D extended channel model was designed and implemented in MATLAB to determine the user performance in pico-cells and macro-cells for line-of-sight links and non-line-of-sight link. The received bit mutual information rate abstraction method is used to determine the optimum physical layer throughput based on analysis of all available modulation and coding schemes. Packet error rate and optimum capacity per meter squared are evaluated for pico-cellular and macro-cellular users. Results show that the deployment of pico-cells can be used to improve existing macro network capacity and performance in an LTE-Advanced network.","doi":"10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920299","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913606/6920251/06920299.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920299","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920251","startPage":"287","endPage":"291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance capacity of MIMO heterogeneous LTE-advanced network","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920299","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance capacity of MIMO heterogeneous LTE-advanced network","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920299/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14664896","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6920299/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance capacity of MIMO heterogeneous LTE-advanced network","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1569970693.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.130987S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913606","isNumber":"6920251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913606","xplore-issue":"6920251","articleId":"6920299","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6920300,"authors":[{"name":"Stella I.

There are many systems adopting the OFDM technique, such as IEEE 802.11 a/g/n, IEEE 802.16, Digital Video Broadcasting, etc. Since the subcarriers in an OFDM system are mutually orthogonal in the frequency domain, it is quite sensitive to synchronization errors. In wireless communications, sampling frequency offset (SFO) and carry frequency offset (CFO) will induce inter-carrier interference (ICI) and they are fatal to OFDM system. In this paper, we propose a scheme to deal with ICI. An iterative receiver design which joins SFO, CFO and channel estimation is presented. It can bear normalized CFO about \u00b10.25 from computer simulations, and the new receiver designs which can effectively combat the synchronizaton problem of OFDM is proved.","doi":"10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920307","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913606/6920251/06920307.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920307","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920251","startPage":"177","endPage":"182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Iterative receiver design with CFO, SFO, channel estimation and equalization for OFDM systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920307","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Iterative receiver design with CFO, SFO, channel estimation and equalization for OFDM systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920307/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14664889","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6920307/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Iterative receiver design with CFO, SFO, channel estimation and equalization for OFDM systems","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1569971041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.126424S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913606","isNumber":"6920251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913606","xplore-issue":"6920251","articleId":"6920307","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6920316,"authors":[{"name":"Kazuhiro Kosaka","affiliation":["Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Adaptive Communications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Kazuhiro","lastName":"Kosaka","id":"37085345646"},{"name":"Keiji Takakusaki","affiliation":["Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Adaptive Communications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Keiji","lastName":"Takakusaki","id":"37352209700"},{"name":"Issei Kanno","affiliation":["Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Adaptive Communications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Issei","lastName":"Kanno","id":"37085340470"},{"name":"Akio Hasegawa","affiliation":["Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Adaptive Communications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Akio","lastName":"Hasegawa","id":"37337731800"},{"name":"Hiroyuki Shinbo","affiliation":["Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Adaptive Communications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroyuki","lastName":"Shinbo","id":"37085357981"},{"name":"Yoshio Takeuchi","affiliation":["Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International, Adaptive Communications Research Laboratories, Kyoto, Japan"],"firstName":"Yoshio","lastName":"Takeuchi","id":"37085354495"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3711-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3710-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920316","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Bit error rate","Interference","Mobile communication","Radio spectrum management","Frequency synchronization","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["broadband networks","interference (signal)","OFDM modulation","radio receivers","radio transceivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio systems","wideband NC-OFDM","wideband noncontiguous OFDM","frequency bands","OFDM subcarriers","frequency resources","WNC-OFDM receiver","WNC-OFDM signals","radio systems","WNC-OFDM transceivers","computer simulations"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Wideband","Non-Contiguous","OFDM","Interference","Synchronization"]}],"abstract":"We are studying Wideband Non-Contiguous OFDM (WNC-OFDM) to utilize unused frequency bands.

In this paper, we evaluate the influences in a WNC-OFDM receiver by developed experimental equipment and computer simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of influence by simultaneous reception of other radio systems in wideband NC-OFDM","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","doi":"10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920316","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Wireless and Mobile","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913606/6920251/06920316.pdf","startPage":"269","endPage":"274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APWiMob.2014.6920316","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920251","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920316","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920316/","chronOrPublicationDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of influence by simultaneous reception of other radio systems in wideband NC-OFDM","conferenceDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920316/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14664877","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of influence by simultaneous reception of other radio systems in wideband NC-OFDM","confLoc":"Bali, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"1569980347.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062938S","chronDate":"28-30 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913606","isNumber":"6920251","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913606","xplore-issue":"6920251","articleId":"6920316","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6920329,"authors":[{"name":"Jiansong Miao","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Teleco mmunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jiansong","lastName":"Miao","id":"37085381950"},{"name":"Lin Ma","affiliation":["Beijing University of Posts and Teleco mmunications, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lin","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085383039"},{"name":"Kai Liu","affiliation":["Guangxi Normal University, Guangxi, China"],"firstName":"Kai","lastName":"Liu","id":"37085393888"},{"name":"Yan Wang","affiliation":["Dalian Branch of Liaoning Planning and Designing, Institute of Post and Telecommunication Co., Ltd, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085395498"},{"name":"Shuying Wang","affiliation":["Dalian Branch of Liaoning Planning and Designing, Institute of Post and Telecommunication Co., Ltd, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Shuying","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085390768"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4808-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6920329","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"abstract":"The improved partial proportional fair (IPPF) algorithm for OFDMA relay system is proposed, aiming at solving the fairness scheduling problem.

However, as the interference to licensed spectrum owners needs to be strictly controlled, CR enabled users (CRs) should vacate the using channel immediately on detecting licensed users activity and the end to end performance may be seriously degraded. In this paper, we propose a robust routing scheme for cognitive radio ad hoc networks that can accommodate to the spectrum availability variation and keep stable to guarantee the end to end performance of CRs. The path stability is modeled considering both available channel numbers and channel characteristic along the path. The paths beyond a robust threshold are regarded to be feasible and the one with maximal throughput is chosen for transmission. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs much better than other existing protocols in terms of route throughput and stability maintenance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920330/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14652564","publicationDate":"April 2014","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920330/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Maximal throughput routing with stablility constraint in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximal throughput routing with stablility constraint in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"001333.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056471S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6906542","isNumber":"6920317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6906542","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6920317","articleId":"6920330","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6920332,"authors":[{"name":"Ji Yun-yun","affiliation":["College of Communications and Information Engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Yun-yun","id":"38278134500"},{"name":"Yang Zhen","affiliation":["Ministry of Education, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China"],"firstName":"Yang","lastName":"Zhen","id":"37279231900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4808-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6920332","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":133},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Noise","Signal processing algorithms","Sparse matrices","Algorithm design and analysis","Compressed sensing","Tin"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","impulse noise","iterative methods","matrix algebra","signal reconstruction","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Lorentzian hard thresholding pursuit algorithm","compressed sensing","hard thresholding operator","Lorentzian iterative hard thresholding algorithm","sparse reconstruction","impulsive noise environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compressed sensing","impulsive noise","Lorentzian cost function","hard thresholding"]}],"abstract":"The Lorentzian hard thresholding pursuit algorithm is proposed in this paper to achieve efficient reconstruction for compressed sensing in the presence of impulsive noise.

Its key point lies on measuring of the time difference between the upstream and downstream. While high quality of the transducer transmitting/receiving ultrasonic signals is the premise of measuring time difference accurately. This paper studies on the main factors contributing to the uncertainty of the transducer's output signal and focuses on the transducer's frequency, incident angle and the separate distance. The selection principle of transducer's frequency is presented by the analysis of the ultrasonic attention characteristics in the liquid. The incident angle range and precise installation distance of the transducers are calculated and analyzed by Snell's law. Experiments are also carried out with the 1MHz transducers clamped on the aluminium pipe of 20mm outer diameter. The results show that the accurate calculation separate distance 18.16mm is effective to guarantee the output of high quality ultrasonic wave. If the axial installation error reaches more than 3mm, the one beam of ultrasonic signal cannot be guaranteed.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acoustics","Transducers","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Fluid flow measurement","Fluids","Frequency measurement","Time measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","flowmeters","measurement errors","measurement uncertainty","ultrasonic measurement","ultrasonic transducers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["axial installation error","separate distance calculation","Snell's law","ultrasonic attention characteristics","selection principle","incident angle","transducer frequency","measurement uncertainty","time difference measurement","transducer transmitting-receiving ultrasonic signal","noninvasive measurement","clamp-on transit time ultrasonic flow meter","frequency 1 MHz","size 20 mm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Ultrasonic flow meter","Transducer","Ultrasonic frequency","Incident angle","Installation distance"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2014.6920360","publicationTitle":"2014 4th IEEE International Conference on Information Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th IEEE International Conference on Information Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6906542/6920317/06920360.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920317","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2014.6920360","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Studies on the transducers of clamp-on transit-time ultrasonic flow meter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920360","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Studies on the transducers of clamp-on transit-time ultrasonic flow meter","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920360/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920360/","accessionNumber":"14664485","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Studies on the transducers of clamp-on transit-time ultrasonic flow meter","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"004385.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04502S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6906542","isNumber":"6920317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6906542","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6920317","articleId":"6920360","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6920361,"authors":[{"name":"Zili Chen","affiliation":["Air Force Logistics College Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Zili","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085349673"},{"name":"Wei Zheng","affiliation":["Air Force Logistics College Xuzhou, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37085366133"},{"name":"Xi Chen","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering and Optoelectronic Technology, Nanjing University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085346616"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4808-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6920361","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":81},"keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","convolutional codes","fading channels","forward error correction","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional interleaver","OFDM-based cognitive radio systems","severely fading channel","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","mature technique","consecutive errors","forward error correction","FEC","register capacity","processing delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convolutional interleaver","OFDM","Cognitive radio","severely fading channel"]}],"abstract":"Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based cognitive system is a mature technique in cognitive radio (CR).

First, the low-rate measurement sequence of the received signal is obtained by CS. Second, the autocorrelation of the received signal is estimated from the low-rate measurement sequence. Then finally, the PSD of the received signal is computed using the BT approach. It is possible to estimate the wideband spectrum from a low sampling rate when using the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the method does not reconstruct the received signal, which can significantly reduce complexity.

We proposed developed methods based on multilayer feed-forward back-propagation algorithm using one hidden layer that is able to recognize numbers and letters in a plate. We also proposed method that is able to find some area with a number plate, which is cut out from the input image and forwarded to neural network application. The performance of the proposed system has been tested on real images.","displayPublicationTitle":"13th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6915059/6920413/06920470.pdf","startPage":"140","endPage":"143","publicationTitle":"13th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS 2013)","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2013.6920470","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2013.6920470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920413","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vision system for licence plate recognition based on neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical character recognition software","Image segmentation","Neural networks","Computer vision","Optical computing","Optical imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","computer vision","feedforward neural nets","optical character recognition","traffic engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["vision system","licence plate recognition","artificial neural networks","computer vision","vehicle number plate recognition","optical character recognition","digital pictures","multilayer feedforward backpropagation algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","computer vision","optical character recognition (OCR)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Vision system for licence plate recognition based on neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920470/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14652642","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vision system for licence plate recognition based on neural networks","confLoc":"Gammarth, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"paper29.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037894S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6915059","isNumber":"6920413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915059","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6920413","articleId":"6920470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6920471,"authors":[{"name":"Atta-ur-Rahman","affiliation":["Barani Institute of Information Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"lastName":"Atta-ur-Rahman"},{"name":"Ijaz Mansoor Qureshi","affiliation":["Institute of Signals, Systems and Soft-computing (ISSS), Islamabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Ijaz Mansoor","lastName":"Qureshi"},{"name":"Muhammad Hammad Salam","affiliation":["The University of Lahore, Lahore, PK"],"firstName":"Muhammad Hammad","lastName":"Salam"},{"name":"Muhammad Tahir Naseem","affiliation":["Barani Institute of Information Technology, Rawalpindi, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Muhammad Tahir","lastName":"Naseem"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2439-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2438-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920471","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":57},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Hardware","MIMO","Resource management","Modulation","OFDM","Bit error rate"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","fuzzy set theory","MIMO communication","OFDM modulation","quality of service","simulated annealing","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["orthogonal frequency division multiplexing environment","adaptive coding","SAFRBS","fuzzy rule base system","simulated annealing algorithm","linear phenomenon","transmission interval","quality of service demand","modulation scheme","code rate","transmit power","transmission parameters","link survival","adaptive communication","hybrid intelligent technique","OFDM systems","link adaptation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Simulated Annealing","OFDM","FRBS","BER","Adaptive Modulation and Coding"]}],"abstract":"Adaptive communication for rate enhancement and link survival is a recent area of interest.

In this article, a multi-layer hybrid machine learning intrusion detection system is designed and developed to achieve high efficiency and improve the detection and classification rate accuracy inspired by immune systems with negative selection approach. In the first layer, principal component analysis (PCA) algorithm was used for feature selection. Then, genetic algorithm was applied to generate anomaly detectors, which are able to discriminate between normal and anomalous behaviors in the second layer. It is followed by applying classification using several classifiers including naive bayes, multilayer perceptron neural network, and decision trees to increase the detection accuracy and obtain more information on the detected anomalies. The selected classifiers are trained and applied to label the detected anomalies in both the normal and anomalous traffic. The principle interest of this work is to benchmark the performance of the proposed multi-layer IDS system by using NSL-KDD benchmark data set used by IDS researchers. The obtained results demonstrated that naive bayes classifier has better classification accuracy in the case of lower presented attacks such as U2R and R2L, while the J48 decision tree classifier gives high accuracy up to 82% for DoS attacks and 65.4% for probe attacks in the anomaly traffic.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2013.6920485","publicationTitle":"13th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS 2013)","displayPublicationTitle":"13th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6915059/6920413/06920485.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2013.6920485","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920413","startPage":"215","endPage":"220","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-layer hybrid machine learning techniques for anomalies detection and classification approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920485","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Multi-layer hybrid machine learning techniques for anomalies detection and classification approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920485/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14652636","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6920485/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-layer hybrid machine learning techniques for anomalies detection and classification approach","confLoc":"Gammarth, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"paper46.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065332S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6915059","isNumber":"6920413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915059","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6920413","articleId":"6920485","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6920500,"authors":[{"name":"Peng Cao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Medical Image Computing of Ministry of Education, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Peng Cao","id":"37087657197"},{"name":"Dazhe Zhao","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Medical Image Computing of Ministry of Education, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"lastName":"Dazhe Zhao","id":"37087285014"},{"name":"Osmar Zaiane","affiliation":["Computing Science, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada"],"firstName":"Osmar","lastName":"Zaiane","id":"37267257300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2439-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2438-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920500","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":175},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Annealing","Glass","Testing","Radio frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary computation","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","pattern classification","search problems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-sensitive neural network ensemble","multiclass imbalance data learning","classification algorithms","imbalanced datasets","diverse random subspace ensemble learning","evolutionary search technique","minimum overlapping mechanism","UCI dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["imbalanced data","cost sensitive learning","ensemble classifier","swarm intelligence"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920500","abstract":"The performance of traditional classification algorithms can be limited on imbalanced datasets.

We propose a hybrid method that combines two ideas: diverse random subspace ensemble learning with evolutionary search, to improve the performance of neural network on multiclass imbalanced data. An evolutionary search technique is utilized to optimize the misclassification cost under the guidance of imbalanced data measures. Moreover, the diverse random subspace ensemble employs the minimum overlapping mechanism to provide diversity so as to improve the performance of the learning and optimization of neural network. We have demonstrated experimentally using UCI datasets that our approach can achieve better result than state-of-the-art methods for imbalanced data.","doi":"10.1109/HIS.2013.6920500","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","publicationTitle":"13th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS 2013)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/HIS.2013.6920500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920413","displayPublicationTitle":"13th International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems (HIS 2013)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6915059/6920413/06920500.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measure optimized cost-sensitive neural network ensemble for multiclass imbalance data learning","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920500/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Measure optimized cost-sensitive neural network ensemble for multiclass imbalance data learning","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920500/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14652619","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","conferenceDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measure optimized cost-sensitive neural network ensemble for multiclass imbalance data learning","confLoc":"Gammarth","sourcePdf":"paper8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105906S","chronDate":"4-6 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6915059","isNumber":"6920413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915059","xplore-issue":"6920413","articleId":"6920500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6920507,"authors":[{"name":"Jianli Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jianli","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085342983"},{"name":"Xudong Yin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xudong","lastName":"Yin","id":"37085537460"},{"name":"Jiayin Qin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Communications Engineering, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Qin","id":"37272689000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4808-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6920507","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":87},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Vectors","Particle swarm optimization","Cooperative systems","MIMO","Constraint optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cooperative communication","particle swarm optimisation","precoding","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization aided sum rate maximization","multipoint to multipoint cooperative systems","optimal linear precoder","relay node","relay power constraint","constraint optimization problem","optimal precoding vector","zero forcing","Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno quasiNewton algorithm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)","sum rate maximization","precoding","cooperative systems","complexity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920507","abstract":"In this paper, we study the problem of designing an optimal linear precoder for relay node to maximize the sum rate in multipoint to multipoint cooperative systems under the relay power constraint.

For instance, when the image is processed in the space, the realtime processing, low power consumption, reduced complexity and low memory consumption are required. Lifting-based DWT is implemented to lessen complexity. And then the coefficients of the lifting filters are turned to be binary and the filters are therefore implemented efficiently without using any multiplier. In this way the frequency of DWT can be improved and the architecture is simplified. When 2-dimensional DWT is carried out, the line-based wavelet transform is able to save memory in a larger sense. The architecture of line-based wavelet can also be executed in a parallel way. Both horizontal transform and vertical transform can be executed at the same time. This paper takes 9/7 wavelet as an example and compares with others its architecture and performance. The advantages of this design include real-time performance improvement, memory reduction and architecture simplification.","doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2014.6920531","publicationTitle":"2014 4th IEEE International Conference on Information Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th IEEE International Conference on Information Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6906542/6920317/06920531.pdf","startPage":"523","endPage":"526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2014.6920531","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-memory-usage and high-speed image wavelet transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920531","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920531/","displayDocTitle":"Low-memory-usage and high-speed image wavelet transform","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14652464","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920531/","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-memory-usage and high-speed image wavelet transform","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"0124207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050562S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6906542","isNumber":"6920317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6906542","xplore-issue":"6920317","articleId":"6920531","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6920535,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandra Lodge","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Alexandra","lastName":"Lodge","id":"37085574444"},{"name":"Xiao-Hua Yu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, California Polytechnic State University, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Xiao-Hua","lastName":"Yu","id":"37336986000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4808-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6920535","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wind speed","Biological neural networks","Training","Artificial neural networks","Temperature measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","power engineering computing","wind power"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short term wind speed prediction","artificial neural networks","fossil fuels","wind power generation","renewable natural resource","wind farm management","supply-demand balancing","smart grid","ANN","National Wind Technology Center"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wind speed prediction","artificial neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920535","abstract":"As an alternative to fossil fuels, wind is a plentiful, clean, and renewable natural resource for energy.

The proposed SD detector consists of a series of SD algorithms with each one associated with an activated dispersion matrix pattern. Specifically, first, a lower bound of the distance measure for each possible activated dispersion matrix pattern is proposed. Then, SD algorithms are performed successively after rearranging these patterns in the order of non-decreasing lower bound. Furthermore, the list SD detector is also presented which can be employed as the soft detector in the turbo receiver for the coded G-STSK scheme.

For the sake of overcoming the drawback caused by perspective projection, we innovatively design an approach based on compensating for images under perspective projection to eliminate the influence of perspective projection.

Since its introduction, the parameter tuning of PSO has always been a hot topic. As a robust design method, the Taguchi method is known as a good tool in designing parameters. Thus the Taguchi method is adopted to analyze the effect of inertia weight, acceleration coefficients, population size, fitness evaluations, and population topology on PSO, and to identify the best settings of them for different optimization problems. The results of benchmark functions show that the optimum parameter settings depend on the benchmarks, and all the functions obtain their optimum solutions after parameter tuning. Good result are also achieved when dealing with the optimization design of a Halbach permanent magnet motor, which indicates that the PSO with best parameter settings identified by the Taguchi method is more suitable to such actual engineering problem.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920579/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14652542","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920579/","publicationDate":"April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Parameter tuning of particle swarm optimization by using Taguchi method and its application to motor design","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parameter tuning of particle swarm optimization by using Taguchi method and its application to motor design","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"0172271.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065992S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6906542","isNumber":"6920317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6906542","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6920317","articleId":"6920579","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6920585,"authors":[{"name":"Nan Sha","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Nan","lastName":"Sha","id":"38235960300"},{"name":"Yuanyuan Gao","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Yuanyuan","lastName":"Gao","id":"37715178000"},{"name":"Lihua Chen","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Lihua","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085346791"},{"name":"Wenlong Li","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Wenlong","lastName":"Li","id":"37675160000"},{"name":"Yanshan Long","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Yanshan","lastName":"Long","id":"37085359141"},{"name":"Shijie Wang","affiliation":["College of Communications Engineering, PLA University of Science and Technology, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China"],"firstName":"Shijie","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085367751"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4808-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4809-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-4357"}],"articleNumber":"6920585","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":155},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","OFDM","Fading","Bit error rate","Network coding","Wireless communication","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["continuous phase modulation","network coding","OFDM modulation","protocols","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM CPM signals","two way relay channels","physical layer network coding","relay aided communications","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","continuous phase modulation","PNC protocol","TWR communication","MAC phase","decoding scheme","relay receiver"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical-layer network coding","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","continuous phase modulation","two-way relay"]}],"abstract":"Physical-layer network coding (PNC) has obtained much attention due to its ability to improve throughput in relay-aided communications. In this paper, we introduce orthogonal frequency division multiplexing-continuous phase modulation (OFDM-CPM) signals into a two-way relay (TWR) channel adopting the PNC protocol to form a new scheme. With PNC, the TWR communication is performed during two phases. In the multiple access (MAC) phase, the two users send OFDM-CPM signals concurrently to the relay, and the relay broadcasts the XORed version of the two users' data in the broadcast phase. We focus on the MAC phase and present a decoding scheme for the relay receiver. The error performance of the new scheme is provided by simulation results, and it is shown that the proposed scheme outperforms that of OFDM-PSK for PNC over frequency-selective fading channels.","doi":"10.1109/ICIST.2014.6920585","publicationTitle":"2014 4th IEEE International Conference on Information Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 4th IEEE International Conference on Information Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6906542/6920317/06920585.pdf","startPage":"747","endPage":"750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIST.2014.6920585","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OFDM-CPM signals in two-way relay channels with physical-layer network coding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920585","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 April 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920585/","displayDocTitle":"OFDM-CPM signals in two-way relay channels with physical-layer network coding","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14664471","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920585/","conferenceDate":"26-28 April 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OFDM-CPM signals in two-way relay channels with physical-layer network coding","confLoc":"Shenzhen, China","sourcePdf":"0178279.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053753S","chronDate":"26-28 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6906542","isNumber":"6920317","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6906542","xplore-issue":"6920317","articleId":"6920585","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6920613,"authors":[{"name":"Shoujun Song","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Shoujun","lastName":"Song","id":"37711050100"},{"name":"Man Zhang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Man","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085402370"},{"name":"Lefei Ge","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lefei","lastName":"Ge","id":"37085416584"},{"name":"Lusheng Wang","affiliation":["School of Automation, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lusheng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085419635"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2733-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920613","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":221},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Stators","Rotors","Torque","Genetic algorithms","Finite element analysis","Optimization","Electromagnetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic launchers","finite element analysis","genetic algorithms","reluctance machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiobjective optimal design","switched reluctance linear launcher","static electromagnetic characteristics","dynamic performances","rotating switched reluctance machine","RSRM","single-side switched reluctance linear launcher","SRLL","lumped parameter thermal network","LPTN model","2-D FEM thermal model","FEM","power 1 kW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920613","abstract":"In this paper, based on the comparison of static electromagnetic characteristics and dynamic performances with corresponding rotating switched reluctance machine (RSRM), the original design scheme of a 1kW single-side switched reluctance linear launcher (SRLL) is obtained by traditional method.

In lots of launching experiments, a big chunk of deposit aluminum can be found on the rail surface at the start-up position of the armature-rail contact area, sometimes, erosion can even be turned up. The transition at current ramp-up is mainly related to local degradation of armature. The bigger value of maximum current densities at the rail/armature (A/R) interface lead armature local temperature to increase rapidly, which can deteriorate the material property of armature, degrade the static electrical contact performance, and significantly reduce the railgun lifetime. In this paper, for restraining startup transition, several influencing factors of armature degradation and melt are studied basis of current concentration. Rail resistivity, rail dimensions, armature resistivity and the shape of current supply are considered and simulated. At current start up, skin effect and induced current are analyzed, and which are considered as the direct factors of armature's current distribution. Armature current distribution and the maximum current density are obtained and compared for each factor. At last, launching experiments are carried out as the same condition with simulation, the deposition on the rail surface at the startup position of the A/R interface reflect that the different factors influence the current distribution on armature at the current ramp up, and the results are in reasonable agreement with simulation description.","doi":"10.1109/EML.2014.6920645","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EML.2014.6920645","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/6911425/6920135/06920645.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 17th International Symposium on Electromagnetic Launch Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920135","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Influencing factors study of armature current distribution at current ramp-up in railgun","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"7-11 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Influencing factors study of armature current distribution at current ramp-up in railgun","conferenceDate":"7-11 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920645/","accessionNumber":"14664683","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920645/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Influencing factors study of armature current distribution at current ramp-up in railgun","confLoc":"La Jolla, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"265PID3390119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047184S","chronDate":"7-11 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6911425","isNumber":"6920135","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6911425","xplore-issue":"6920135","articleId":"6920645","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6920651,"authors":[{"name":"Xu Qiwei","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Power Transmission Equipment & System Security and New Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"firstName":"Xu","lastName":"Qiwei","id":"37085466502"},{"name":"Cui Shumei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Cui","lastName":"Shumei","id":"37294436100"},{"name":"Zhang Qianfan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Qianfan","id":"37590103000"},{"name":"Song Liwei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Song","lastName":"Liwei","id":"37687008800"},{"name":"Xiyuan Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Xiyuan","lastName":"Li","id":"37076509100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2733-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920651","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":161},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920651","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Induction motors","Adaptation models","Mathematical model","Parameter estimation","Equations","Control systems","Inductance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic launchers","induction motors","linear motors","Lyapunov methods","machine control","mathematical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["thrust control strategy","thrust control strategy","dynamic response","secondary flux","q-axis component","thrust deviation correction system","Lyapunov stabilization theory","adaptive parameters identification","mathematical model","thrust control accuracy","transportation application","convey systems","electromagnetic aircraft launch","linear induction motor"]}],"abstract":"The linear induction motor is widely used in electromagnetic aircraft launch, convey systems and transportation application, and the thrust control accuracy of linear induction motor is the most important technical factor for stable running.

Some 2D magnetic analyses based on current sheet model or transmission line approach for the LIL type launchers are available in the literature but this paper provides an alternative way to analyze LIL type of EMLs by using 3D Finite Element Method (FEM). The analysis examines into the variation of propulsion, levitation, and guidance forces induced in the moving part.

One of its well-known drawbacks is its propensity for premature convergence. Many techniques have been proposed for alleviating this problem. One of the alternative approaches is hybridization. Genetic Algorithms (GA) are one of the possible techniques used for hybridization. Most often, a mutation scheme is added to the PSO, but some applications of crossover have been added more recently. Some of these schemes use adaptive parameterization when applying the GA operators. In this work, adaptively parameterized mutation and crossover operators are combined with a PSO implementation individually and in combination to test the effectiveness of these additions. The results indicate that an adaptive approach with position factor is more effective for the proposed PSO hybrids. Compared to single PSO with adaptive inertia weight, all the PSO hybrids with adaptive probability have shown satisfactory performance in generating near-optimal solutions for all tested functions.","doi":"10.1109/ISDA.2013.6920726","publicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Intellient Systems Design and Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 13th International Conference on Intellient Systems Design and Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6915060/6920429/06920726.pdf","startPage":"153","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISDA.2013.6920726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920429","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybridization of Particle Swarm Optimization with adaptive genetic algorithm operators","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920726","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920726/","displayDocTitle":"Hybridization of Particle Swarm Optimization with adaptive genetic algorithm operators","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","accessionNumber":"14652711","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920726/","conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybridization of Particle Swarm Optimization with adaptive genetic algorithm operators","confLoc":"Salangor, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"paper39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119743S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6915060","isNumber":"6920429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915060","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6920429","articleId":"6920726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6920740,"authors":[{"name":"Tiia Ikonen","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland"],"firstName":"Tiia","lastName":"Ikonen","id":"37085375604"},{"name":"Keijo Haataja","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland"],"firstName":"Keijo","lastName":"Haataja","id":"37303797800"},{"name":"Pekka Toivanen","affiliation":["School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland"],"firstName":"Pekka","lastName":"Toivanen","id":"37269165500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3516-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3515-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7143"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-7151"}],"articleNumber":"6920740","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic resonance imaging","Three-dimensional displays","Educational institutions","Abstracts","Biomedical imaging","Image segmentation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain","feature extraction","medical disorders","medical image processing","transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3D imaging","human brain","insomnia diagnostics","depression diagnostics","2D distance transforms","feature extraction method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["3D-DTOCS","3D-WDTOCS","3D Imaging","Depression","Insomnia"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920740","abstract":"In this paper, we provide a literature review based comparative analysis of the current state-of-the-art methods on 3D imaging of human brain in the diagnostics of insomnia and depression.

Solving ATSP is NP-hard and it is harder if the problem is with large scale data. This paper intends to address the ATSP using an hybrid approach which integrates the generic Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) framework and an insertion-based local search procedure. The generic BCO framework computationally realizes the bee foraging behaviour in a typical bee colony where bees travel across different locations to discover new food sources and perform waggle dances to recruit more bees towards newly discovered food sources. Besides the bee foraging behaviour, the generic BCO framework is enriched with an initialization engine, a fragmented solution construction mechanism, a local search and a pruning strategy. When the proposed algorithm is tested on a set of 27 ATSP benchmark problem instances, 37% of the benchmark instances are constantly solved to optimum. 89% of the problem instances are optimally solved for at least once. On average, the proposed BCO algorithm is able to obtain 0.140% deviation from known optimum for all the 27 instances. In terms of the average computational time, the proposed algorithm requires 48.955s (<; 1 minutes) to obtain the best tour length for each instance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920757/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-10 Dec. 2013","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-10 Dec. 2013","htmlLink":"/document/6920757/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14652678","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Solving Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems using a generic Bee Colony Optimization framework with insertion local search","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving Asymmetric Traveling Salesman Problems using a generic Bee Colony Optimization framework with insertion local search","confLoc":"Salangor, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"paper8.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099729S","chronDate":"8-10 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6915060","isNumber":"6920429","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915060","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6920429","articleId":"6920757","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6920760,"authors":[{"name":"Anas Arram","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, MY"],"firstName":"Anas","lastName":"Arram","id":"37085634280"},{"name":"Hisham Mousa","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, MY"],"firstName":"Hisham","lastName":"Mousa","id":"37088247360"},{"name":"Anzida Zainal","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, MY"],"firstName":"Anzida","lastName":"Zainal","id":"37284442700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3516-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3515-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7143"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2164-7151"}],"articleNumber":"6920760","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":224},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Accuracy","Biological cells","Testing","Postal services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","learning (artificial intelligence)","neural nets","unsolicited e-mail"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spam detection","hybrid artificial neural network","genetic algorithm","complex parameters","ANN parameters","ANN learning","hybrid ANN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spam","Artificial Neural Network (ANN)","Genetic Algorithm (GA)","Back Propagation (BP)"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920760","abstract":"Spam detection is one of the major problems which considered by many researchers by different developed strategies.

In modern deep-submicron technologies, MOS transistor operating region tends to shift from strong inversion to moderate inversion, this makes traditional square-law MOS device modeling not applicable anymore. Thus a simplified EKV model, which is quite successful in all CMOS operating regions, has been adopted to develop a new analytical methodology to optimize geometry of current source transistors so that the noise contribution from these transistors is only a fraction of input transistor noise. A charge sensitive amplifier based on dual PMOS cascode structure is designed by adopting this current source transistor sizing methodology, and has been simulated using 130nm CMOS technology. The proposed methodology and noise contribution from current source transistors have been found in good agreement with simulation results using deep-submicron CMOS technology.","doi":"10.1109/SMELEC.2014.6920828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMELEC.2014.6920828","startPage":"189","endPage":"192","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics (ICSE2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6912063/6920764/06920828.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics (ICSE2014)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transistor sizing methodology for low noise charge sensitive amplifier with input transistor working in moderate inversion","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Transistor sizing methodology for low noise charge sensitive amplifier with input transistor working in moderate inversion","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920828/","accessionNumber":"14664769","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920828/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transistor sizing methodology for low noise charge sensitive amplifier with input transistor working in moderate inversion","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0491569982699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048176S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912063","isNumber":"6920764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912063","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6920764","articleId":"6920828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6920846,"authors":[{"name":"Norazreen Abd Aziz","affiliation":["Institute of Microengineering and Nanoelectronics (IMEN), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Norazreen Abd","lastName":"Aziz","id":"37699273500"},{"name":"Badariah Bais","affiliation":["Institute of Microengineering and Nanoelectronics (IMEN), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Badariah","lastName":"Bais","id":"37542964800"},{"name":"Muhamad Ramdzan Buyong","affiliation":["Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor, MY"],"firstName":"Muhamad Ramdzan","lastName":"Buyong","id":"37659640100"},{"name":"Burhanuddin Yeop Majlis","affiliation":["Institute of Microengineering and Nanoelectronics (IMEN), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Burhanuddin Yeop","lastName":"Majlis","id":"38191347800"},{"name":"Anis Nurashikin Nordin","affiliation":["ECE Department, International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM), Gombak, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Anis Nurashikin","lastName":"Nordin","id":"37302862100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5760-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920846","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":213},"abstract":"In this paper, we discussed simulation of several annular surface acoustic wave (A-SAW) devices using various wavelengths to identify its effects on the focusing properties and to analyze the propagation of Rayleigh waves in piezoelectric substrate. By choosing Y-cut Z propagating Lithium Niobate as the substrate and aluminum electrodes as the IDT, we modeled the A-SAW devices using Comsol Multiphysics. We used 8 pairs of annular electrodes with thickness of 1 \u03bcm with three different design's wavelength of 100 \u03bcm, 150 \u03bcm and 200 \u03bcm, respectively. To minimize the computational time in determining the optimum frequency i.e. resonant frequency of the device, only one pair of electrode for each design is simulated under eigenfrequency analysis in 2D piezoelectric (pzd) module. To understand the Rayleigh waves behavior, simulation of the whole device structure was done under frequency domain analysis in 2D-axisymmetric piezoelectric module. From the simulation results, it can be observed that SAW displacement profiles, electric potential field and operating frequency are significantly influenced by the wavelength. The formation of focused acoustic waves at the center of A-SAW device suits them in biosensing and microfluidic actuation applications that require detection or manipulation of localized variations.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics (ICSE2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6912063/6920764/06920846.pdf","startPage":"259","endPage":"262","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics (ICSE2014)","doi":"10.1109/SMELEC.2014.6920846","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMELEC.2014.6920846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920764","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FEM analysis of wavelength effects in piezoelectric substrate","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrodes","Surface acoustic wave devices","Resonant frequency","Substrates","Surface acoustic waves","Electric potential"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["finite element analysis","frequency-domain analysis","lithium compounds","surface acoustic wave devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FEM analysis","wavelength effects","piezoelectric substrate","annular surface acoustic wave device","A-SAW device","Rayleigh wave propagation","V-cut Z propagating lithium niobate","aluminum electrodes","IDT","Comsol Multiphysics","annular electrodes","design wavelength","computational time minimization","optimum frequency","device resonant frequency","eigenfrequency analysis","2D piezoelectric module","2D pzd module","Rayleigh wave behavior","device structure simulation","frequency domain analysis","2D-axisymmetric piezoelectric module","SAW displacement profiles","electric potential field","operating frequency","focused acoustic waves","biosensing application","microfluidic actuation application","localized variation detection","localized variation manipulation","wavelength 100 mum","wavelength 150 mum","wavelength 200 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["surface acoustic wave","Rayleigh wave","Lithium Niobate","Comsol Mutiphysics"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920846/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"FEM analysis of wavelength effects in piezoelectric substrate","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920846/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14664826","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FEM analysis of wavelength effects in piezoelectric substrate","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0671569993119.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082802S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912063","isNumber":"6920764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912063","xplore-issue":"6920764","articleId":"6920846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6920862,"authors":[{"name":"Siti Lailatul Mohd Hassan","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, MY"],"firstName":"Siti Lailatul Mohd","lastName":"Hassan"},{"name":"Idalailah Dayah","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering, UniversitiTeknologi Mara, Shah Alam, Selangor"],"firstName":"Idalailah","lastName":"Dayah","id":"37085538663"},{"name":"Ili Shairah Abdul Halim","affiliation":["Universiti Teknologi MARA, Shah Alam, Selangor, MY"],"firstName":"Ili Shairah Abdul","lastName":"Halim"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5760-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920862","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1114},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparative study on 8T SRAM with different type of sense amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920862","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Delays","Inverters","Noise","Power dissipation","Logic gates","Transistors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplifiers","CMOS memory circuits","current-mode circuits","integrated circuit design","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["8T SRAM","voltage-mode sense amplifier","VMSA","current-mode sense amplifier","CMSA","CMOS memories","sensing delay","bit line bar","SILVACO EDA gateway","date line capacitances","SILVACO EDA Expert","low power dissipation","noise margin","high speed performance","low power circuitry","size 0.18 mum"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Voltage mode sense amplifier","Current mode sense amplifier","8T SRAM"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents the comparative study on 8T SRAM with different type of sense amplifier. These sense amplifiers are voltage-mode sense amplifier (VMSA) and current-mode sense amplifier (CMSA). The first objective of this research is to design the 8T SRAM and sense amplifier and the next objective is to identify which design has better performance in term of power, speed, stability and area. Sense amplifiers are one of the most critical circuits in the periphery of CMOS memories that plays an important role to reduce the overall sensing delay and voltage. Earlier voltage mode sense amplifiers sense the voltage difference at bit and bit lines bar but as the memory size increase the bit line and date line capacitances increases. The tools used for simulation is SILVACO EDA Gateway and SILVACO EDA Expert for layout using 0.18um technology. The results show that the CMSA has higher speed with lower delay, and low power dissipation than VMSA. But, VMSA has smaller cell area and higher noise margin than CMSA. CMSA is more suitable for high speed performance and low power circuitry and VMSA is best suited for stability and smaller design.","doi":"10.1109/SMELEC.2014.6920862","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SMELEC.2014.6920862","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics (ICSE2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Semiconductor Electronics (ICSE2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6912063/6920764/06920862.pdf","startPage":"321","endPage":"324","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920764","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920862/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Comparative study on 8T SRAM with different type of sense amplifier","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14664783","htmlLink":"/document/6920862/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparative study on 8T SRAM with different type of sense amplifier","confLoc":"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","sourcePdf":"0831569982559.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053646S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912063","isNumber":"6920764","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912063","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6920764","articleId":"6920862","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6920865,"authors":[{"name":"Rosalind Deena Kumari Selvam","affiliation":["Faculty of Computing & Informatics, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Malaysia"],"firstName":"Rosalind","lastName":"Deena Kumari Selvam","id":"37085449660"},{"name":"C.

This technique has been extensively studied over the past decade and its practical feasibility has been demonstrated in multiple experimental prototypes. Our contributions in the work reported in this paper are three-fold: (a) the first ever all-wireless implementation of distributed beamforming without any secondary wired channels for clock distribution or channel feedback, (b) a novel digital baseband approach to synchronization of high frequency RF signals that requires no hardware mod-ifications, and (c) an implementation of distributed beam-forming on a standard, open platform that allows easy reuse and extension.

For example, in a mining disaster, flooding or a collapse can isolate portions of underground tunnels, severing wired communication links and preventing radio communication. In this pa-per, we explore the use of low frequency magnetic fields for communication, and present a new hardware platform that features triaxial transmitter/receiverantenna loops. We point out that the fundamental problem of the magnetic channel is the limited bitrate at long ranges, due to the extreme path loss of 60 dB/decade. To this end, we present two complementary techniques to address this limitation. Firstly, we demonstrate magnetic vector modulation, a technique which modulates the three dimensional orientation of the magnetic vector. This increases the gross bitrate by a factor of over 2.5, without an increase in transmission power or bandwidth. Secondly, we show how in a multi-hop network latencies can be dramatically reduced by receiving multiple parallel streams of frequency multiplexed data in a many-to-one configuration. These techniques are demonstrated on a working hardware platform, which for flexible operation, features a software defined magnetic transceiver. Typical communication range is approximately 30 m through rock.","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2012.6920946","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6909388/6920920/06920946.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920920","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2012.6920946","publicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN)","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Magneto-Inductive NEtworked Rescue System (MINERS): Taking sensor networks underground","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920946","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 April 2012","displayDocTitle":"Magneto-Inductive NEtworked Rescue System (MINERS): Taking sensor networks underground","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920946/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920946/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"14664508","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","conferenceDate":"16-20 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Magneto-Inductive NEtworked Rescue System (MINERS): Taking sensor networks underground","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"P17p317markham.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066758S","chronDate":"16-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6909388","isNumber":"6920920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6909388","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6920920","articleId":"6920946","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-17"},{"_id":6920949,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaopei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Univ. of Electronic Science and Technology of China"],"firstName":"Xiaopei","lastName":"Wu","id":"38184563200"},{"name":"Mingyan Liu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor"],"firstName":"Mingyan","lastName":"Liu","id":"37275671500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6469-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920949","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":172},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Soil moisture","Soil measurements","Moisture measurement","Time measurement","Sparse matrices","Sensors","Moisture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hydrological techniques","moisture","soil"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soil moisture sensing","compressive sensing","soil moisture evolution monitoring","wireless network","in-situ underground sensors","soil moisture temporal evolution","soil moisture data"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Measurements Scheduling","Compressive Sensing","Soil Moistture Sensing"]}],"abstract":"We consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture evolution using a wireless network of in-situ underground sensors. To reduce cost and prolong lifetime, it is highly desirable to rely on fewer measurements and estimate with higher accuracy the original signal (soil moisture temporal evolution). In this paper we explore results from the compressive sensing (CS) literature and examine their applicability to this problem. Our main challenge lies in the selection of two matrices, the measurement matrix and a representation basis. The physical constraints of our problem make it highly nontrivial to select these matrices, so that the latter can sufficient sparsify the underlying signal while at the same time be sufficiently incoherent with the former, two common pre-conditions for CS techniques to work well. We construct a representation basis by exploiting unique features of soil moisture evolution. We show that this basis attains very good tradeoff between its ability to sparsify the signal and its incoherence with measurement matrices that are consistent with our physical constraints. Extensive numerical evaluation is performed on both real, high-resolution soil moisture data and simulated data, and through comparison with a closed-loop scheduling approach. Our results demonstrate that our approach is extremely effective in reconstructing the soil moisture process with high accuracy and low sampling rate.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-situ soil moisture sensing: Measurement scheduling and estimation using compressive sensing","publicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN)","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2012.6920949","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6909388/6920920/06920949.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"11","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2012.6920949","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920949","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920949/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 April 2012","displayDocTitle":"In-situ soil moisture sensing: Measurement scheduling and estimation using compressive sensing","conferenceDate":"16-20 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920949/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"14664513","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-situ soil moisture sensing: Measurement scheduling and estimation using compressive sensing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"P1p1wu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080004S","chronDate":"16-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6909388","isNumber":"6920920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6909388","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6920920","articleId":"6920949","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6920960,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Dong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37405344500"},{"name":"Lance Kaplan","affiliation":["Networked Sensing and Fusion Branch, US Army Research Labs, Adelphi, MD"],"firstName":"Lance","lastName":"Kaplan","id":"37085436235"},{"name":"Hieu Le","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Hieu","lastName":"Le","id":"37676187200"},{"name":"Tarek Abdelzaher","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Control, Lund University, Lund, Sweden","Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Tarek","lastName":"Abdelzaher","id":"37085442834"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6469-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6920960","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":49,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":318},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Atmospheric measurements","Particle measurements","Reliability","Maximum likelihood estimation","Silicon","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation-maximisation algorithm","ubiquitous computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expectation maximization problem","truth discovery problem","binary measurements","sensory data collection tasks","noisy social sensing data","maximum likelihood estimation approach"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Social Sensing","Truth Discovery","Maximum Likelihood Estimation","Expectation Maximization"]}],"abstract":"This paper addresses the challenge of truth discovery from noisy social sensing data. The work is motivated by the emergence of social sensing as a data collection paradigm of growing interest, where humans perform sensory data collection tasks. A challenge in social sensing applications lies in the noisy nature of data. Unlike the case with well-calibrated and well-tested infrastructure sensors, humans are less reliable, and the likelihood that participants' measurements are correct is often unknown a priori. Given a set of human participants of unknown reliability together with their sensory measurements, this paper poses the question of whether one can use this information alone to determine, in an analytically founded manner, the probability that a given measurement is true. The paper focuses on binary measurements. While some previous work approached the answer in a heuristic manner, we offer the first optimal solution to the above truth discovery problem. Optimality, in the sense of maximum likelihood estimation, is attained by solving an expectation maximization problem that returns the best guess regarding the correctness of each measurement. The approach is shown to outperform the state of the art fact-finding heuristics, as well as simple baselines such as majority voting.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On truth discovery in social sensing: A maximum likelihood estimation approach","publicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN)","doi":"10.1109/IPSN.2012.6920960","displayPublicationTitle":"2012 ACM/IEEE 11th International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6909388/6920920/06920960.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IPSN.2012.6920960","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920920","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6920960","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6920960/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-20 April 2012","displayDocTitle":"On truth discovery in social sensing: A maximum likelihood estimation approach","conferenceDate":"16-20 April 2012","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6920960/","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","publicationDate":"April 2012","accessionNumber":"14664499","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On truth discovery in social sensing: A maximum likelihood estimation approach","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"P9p233wang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086678S","chronDate":"16-20 April 2012","xplore-pub-id":"6909388","isNumber":"6920920","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6909388","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"6920920","articleId":"6920960","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2012","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6921003,"authors":[{"name":"Mei Na Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Mei Na","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085576005"},{"name":"Chi Fai Cheung","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Chi Fai","lastName":"Cheung","id":"37085578246"},{"name":"Sui Hei Fung","affiliation":["Hong Kong RFID Limited, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Sui Hei","lastName":"Fung","id":"37085581584"},{"name":"Kwok King Tsang","affiliation":["Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Kwok King","lastName":"Tsang","id":"37085579928"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-890843-29-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-5100"}],"articleNumber":"6921003","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":240},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Companies","Technological innovation","Radiofrequency identification","Technology forecasting","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DP industry","innovation management","strategic planning","technological forecasting","technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["technology forecasting","technology assessment","information and communication technology company","technology management","technology planning","inside-out roadmapping","outside-out roadmapping","strategic planning","innovation planning"]}],"abstract":"Technology roadmapping is an indispensable method for aligning closely between strategic objectives and technology management, especially technology-intensive enterprises. It is interesting to note that most companies are pursuing technology roadmapping approaches is very compelling, but the normal perspective for most companies is from inside to out which they start by looking at their own organization. To address the limitations found in the existing methods, this paper aims to develop a hybrid roadmapping method (HRMM) by incorporating two inside-out and outside-in perspectives for technology forecasting and assessment which provides companies with fresh insights for strategic innovation and technology planning. The HRMM is composed of four main steps which include preliminary discussion, inside-out roadmapping, outside-out roadmapping and follow-up discussion, respectively. It has been developed to provide a roadmap for strategic and innovation planning in inside-out and outside-in perspectives. The capability of the HRMM is realized through a case study conducted in the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Industry and encouraging results have been obtained.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PICMET '14 Conference: Portland International Center for Management of Engineering and Technology; Infrastructure and Service Integration","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PICMET '14 Conference: Portland International Center for Management of Engineering and Technology; Infrastructure and Service Integration","pdfPath":"/iel7/6905926/6920983/06921003.pdf","startPage":"2882","endPage":"2890","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid roadmapping method for technology forecasting and assessment: A case study in an Information and Communication Technology Company","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6921003","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921003/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid roadmapping method for technology forecasting and assessment: A case study in an Information and Communication Technology Company","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14664196","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6921003/","conferenceDate":"27-31 July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid roadmapping method for technology forecasting and assessment: A case study in an Information and Communication Technology Company","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"14A0028.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080465S","chronDate":"27-31 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6905926","isNumber":"6920983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6905926","xplore-issue":"6920983","articleId":"6921003","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6921106,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghee Cho","affiliation":["Department of Engineering and Technology Management, Portland State University, OR, USA"],"firstName":"Yonghee","lastName":"Cho","id":"37085469530"},{"name":"Seong-Pil Yoon","affiliation":["Graduate School of Energy and Environment, Seoul National University of Science & Technology, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong-Pil","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37085470133"},{"name":"Karp-Soo Kim","affiliation":["Graduate School of Innovation and Technology Management, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology(KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Karp-Soo","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085467884"},{"name":"Boyoung Chang","affiliation":["Korea Institute for the Advancement of Technology, Korea Technology Center, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Boyoung","lastName":"Chang","id":"37085456485"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-890843-29-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-5100"}],"articleNumber":"6921106","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":305},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmission line measurements","Planning","Technology forecasting","Government","Industries","Market research"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision making","government policies","innovation management","product development","small-to-medium enterprises","strategic planning","technology management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["public R and D planning","industrial technology roadmap","technology forecasting","strategic management tool","new product development","strategic decision making tool","public R and D programs","strategic behavior","evolutionary aspects","South Korea","small and medium-sized companies","TRM","Korea Institute for the Advancement of Technology","government agencies","Korea Industrial Technology Foundation","Korea Technology Transfer Center","Korea Institute of Industrial Technology Evaluation and Planning","Institute for Information Technology Advancement","Korea Material and Components Industrial Agency","Korea National Cleaner Production Center","Korea Institute of Design Promotion","business strategy","government R and D programs"]}],"abstract":"There are a variety of methodologies to forecast future technology, economy, and society. Technology roadmap (TRM) is one of the easily implementable methods of technology forecasting. It is a strategic management tool to support R&D planning and new product development at various levels such as a firm and government. This study aims to address a strategic decision making tool in public R&D programs to affect firms' strategic behavior under this umbrella. The main purpose of this paper is to address evolutionary aspects of industrial technology roadmap and provide a more advanced framework of public R&D planning. In South Korea, technology roadmapping has been initiated by government since 2000 and nowadays popularized in small and medium-sized companies as well. Despite of its popularity, there are only a few literatures to provide practical guidelines and systematic process to develop TRM applicable to R&D planning in any organizations. The framework of industrial technology roadmap developed by the Korea Institute for the Advancement of Technology which is established bringing together old 6 major government agencies such as Korea Industrial Technology Foundation, Korea Technology Transfer Center, Korea Institute of Industrial Technology Evaluation and Planning, Institute for Information Technology Advancement, Korea Material and Components Industrial Agency, Korea National Cleaner Production Center, Korea Institute of Design Promotion, can be applied to the R&D planning process of diverse government R&D programs in other countries.

Additional services include the ability to better integrate growing supplies of renewable energy and perform a variety of value-added services on the grid. However, a number of challenges exist in order to achieving these benefits. Many utility systems have substantial regulatory structures that make business processes and technology innovation substantially different than in other industries. Due to complex histories regarding regulatory and deregulatory efforts, and due to what some economists consider natural monopoly characteristics in the industry, such regulatory structures are unlikely to change in the immediate future. Therefore, innovation within these industries, including the development of smart grid, will require an understanding of such regulatory and policy frameworks, development of appropriate business models, and adaptation of technologies to fit these emerging requirements. Technology Roadmapping may be a useful method of planning this type of future development within the smart grid sector, but such technology roadmaps would require a high level of integrated thinking regarding technology, business, and regulatory and policy considerations. This research provides an initial examination of the process for creating such a type of integrated technology roadmapping and assessment process. This research proposes to build upon previous research in the Pacific Northwest and create a more robust technology planning process that will allow key variables to be tested and different pathways to be explored.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of PICMET '14 Conference: Portland International Center for Management of Engineering and Technology; Infrastructure and Service Integration","pdfPath":"/iel7/6905926/6920983/06921240.pdf","startPage":"2938","endPage":"2959","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of PICMET '14 Conference: Portland International Center for Management of Engineering and Technology; Infrastructure and Service Integration","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920983","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6921240","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing an integrated technology roadmapping process to meet regional technology planning needs: The e-Bike pilot study","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Business","Industries","Smart grids","Planning","Transmission line measurements","Electric vehicles","Biological system modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bicycles","electric vehicles","power system analysis computing","regional planning","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated technology roadmapping process","regional technology planning needs","e-bike pilot study","smart grid development","electric utility systems","smart appliances","power systems","supply-and-demand matching","value-added services","business processes","technology innovation","regulatory structures","policy framework"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921240/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-31 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Developing an integrated technology roadmapping process to meet regional technology planning needs: The e-Bike pilot study","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6921240/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14664446","dateOfInsertion":"13 October 2014","conferenceDate":"27-31 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing an integrated technology roadmapping process to meet regional technology planning needs: The e-Bike pilot study","confLoc":"Kanazawa, Japan","sourcePdf":"14R0303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.140673S","chronDate":"27-31 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6905926","isNumber":"6920983","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6905926","xplore-issue":"6920983","articleId":"6921240","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"PICMET","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6921383,"authors":[{"name":"Rajiv.

The techniques also combine the features of classical depth-first and breadth-first search methods. The descriptions of the algorithms are given. Initially the symbols are decoded using Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) criterion. An array is allocated for storing the nodes which belong to the category of legitimate paths leading to the correct solution. Amongst these nodes the ones which have the smallest euclidean distances are stored in an intermediate array which determines whether their children should be considered for extension of the search. This is done by juxtaposition of the partial solution of the node and the MMSE solution. The children of the selected nodes are placed in the initially allocated array and the iteration continues until the leaves of the tree are reached. It is seen that with the course of the iteration the array consists of nodes at multiple levels. A level-bias metric is also used which facilitates deriving a solution quickly at the expense of a trade-off between throughput and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance. Using Log-Likelihood function it is possible to obtain soft decoding. This leads to increase in the reliability of the decoding process. The proposed algorithms are simulated on a 4\u00d74 16-QAM and 4\u00d74 QPSK multiple-input-multiple-output system. A comparative study of the BER performance between the proposed algorithms with best-first tree search techniques and Sphere-Decoding techniques is done.

The proposed face recognition method can handle facial appearance variations which are caused by facial expression and illumination under controlled capture conditions. Different from traditional face recognition methods, the proposed method uses multiple features which are extracted using Global and Local feature extraction algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) & Local Binary Pattern (LBP). Wavelet fused feature vector has richer information than feature vector extracted using unifeature extraction algorithms. Radial Basis Function (RBF) is used to classify feature vectors. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on the standard benchmark databases like ORL and Grimace.

Taking into account the mounting significance of cloud, finding new ways to advance cloud services is an area of concern and research center. Usually clouds have powerful data centers to handle large number of users. Cloud is a platform providing dynamic pool of resources and virtualization. To properly manage the resources of the service contributor, load balancing is required for the jobs that are submitted to the service contributor. Load balancing is a tactic to share out workload across many virtual machines in a Server over the network to achieve optimal resource consumption, least data processing time, least average response time, and avoid overload. The objective of this paper is to propose efficient and enhanced Hybrid scheduling algorithm that can maintain the load and provides modified resource allocation techniques. In this paper Hybrid approach is applied for load balancing using Throttled and Equally Spread Current Execution (ESCE) algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6921418","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6900020/6920919/06921418.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6921418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid approach using throttled and ESCE load balancing algorithms in cloud computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6921418","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921418/","displayDocTitle":"Hybrid approach using throttled and ESCE load balancing algorithms in cloud computing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14665935","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6921418/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hybrid approach using throttled and ESCE load balancing algorithms in cloud computing","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"041.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051879S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6900020","isNumber":"6920919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6900020","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6920919","articleId":"6921418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6921420,"authors":[{"name":"Suyel Namasudra","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Engineering Tripura University (A Central University) Suryamaninagar, Tripura West, India"],"firstName":"Suyel","lastName":"Namasudra","id":"37085528890"},{"name":"Samir Nath","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Engineering Tripura University (A Central University) Suryamaninagar, Tripura West, India"],"firstName":"Samir","lastName":"Nath","id":"37085531852"},{"name":"Abhishek Majumder","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Engineering Tripura University (A Central University) Suryamaninagar, Tripura West, India"],"firstName":"Abhishek","lastName":"Majumder","id":"37072623200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4982-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"DVD ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4983-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6921420","dbTime":"30 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":351},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Access control","Cloud computing","Public key","Servers","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["authorisation","cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["profile based access control model","cloud computing environment","access control policy","PrBAC model","data redundancy","data owner","DO","cloud server"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Access control models","Cloud Service Provider","Data Owner","Profile Based Access Control Model"]}],"abstract":"Cloud computing is now a day a very lucrative technology due to its efficiency, cost effectiveness, flexibility, scalability and pay-per-use. But with these advantages many new problems have been introduced and some existing problems have become so much critical. One of the existing problems that have become critical in cloud environment is access control. Access control is a procedure that allows a user to access data or file from system. There are several access policies which have to be followed by the users for accessing any kind of data from a server. In cloud environment there are many access control models. In this paper a new access control model namely Profile Based Access Control Model (PrBAC) has been proposed. There are several problems for accessing data like high access time, high searching cost and problem of data redundancy. Another problem of access control models is that the Data Owner (DO) must be always online when user wants to access data from cloud server. By PrBAC all these problems are minimized.","doi":"10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6921420","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6900020/6920919/06921420.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6921420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Profile based access control model in cloud computing environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6921420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921420/","displayDocTitle":"Profile based access control model in cloud computing environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14666040","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6921420/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Profile based access control model in cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.179146S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6900020","isNumber":"6920919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6900020","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6920919","articleId":"6921420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6921423,"authors":[{"name":"Subhadra Bose Shaw","affiliation":["CSED, MNNIT, Allahabad"],"firstName":"Subhadra Bose","lastName":"Shaw","id":"37085458885"},{"name":"A.

The basic requirements of cloud are to meet the various needs of enterprise organizations such as scalability, adaptability, extensibility and manageability. The biggest visible change the cloud computing has made in the scenario of computing is moving the data center offsite to a third party and buying services rather than maintaining onsite applications directly. By its use companies can save money on operational costs and they can focus on their core business instead of being worried about different IT obstacles. Moreover true portability is provided by cloud by enabling access to applications and documents anywhere in the world via the internet through commodity hardware only.

Expansion of a seed node into a community is one of the most successful methods for local community detection, especially when the global structure of the network is not accessible. An algorithm for local community detection only requires a partial knowledge of the network and the computations can be done in parallel starting from seed nodes. The parallel nature of local algorithms allow for fast and scalable solutions, however, the coverage of the communities heavily depends on the seed selection. The communities identified by a local algorithm might cover only a subset of the nodes in a network if the seeds are not selected carefully. In this paper, we propose a novel seeding algorithm which is parameter free, utilizes merely the local structure of the network, and identifies good seeds which span over the whole network. In order to find such seeds, our algorithm first computes similarity indices from local link prediction techniques to assign a similarity score to each node, and then a biased graph coloring algorithm is used to enhance the seed selection. Our experiments using large-scale real-world networks show that our algorithm is able to select good seeds which are then expanded into high quality overlapping communities covering the vast majority of the nodes in the network using a personalized PageRank-based community detection algorithm. We also show that using our local seeding algorithm can dramatically reduce the execution time of community detection.","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6921526","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921552","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6911097/6921526/06921552.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A local seed selection algorithm for overlapping community detection","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921552/","displayDocTitle":"A local seed selection algorithm for overlapping community detection","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"17-20 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14683096","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6921552/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A local seed selection algorithm for overlapping community detection","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"001A337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084632S","chronDate":"17-20 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6911097","isNumber":"6921526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6911097","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6921526","articleId":"6921552","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":6921600,"authors":[{"name":"C\u00e9dric Richier","affiliation":["University of Avignon, Avignon, FRANCE"],"firstName":"C\u00e9dric","lastName":"Richier","id":"37085550411"},{"name":"Eitan Altman","affiliation":["INRIA, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Eitan","lastName":"Altman","id":"37266347900"},{"name":"Rachid Elazouzi","affiliation":["University of Avignon, Avignon, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Rachid","lastName":"Elazouzi","id":"37570287300"},{"name":"Tania Jimenez","affiliation":["University of Avignon, Avignon, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Tania","lastName":"Jimenez","id":"37265530600"},{"name":"Georges Linares","affiliation":["University of Avignon, Avignon, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Linares","id":"37281655000"},{"name":"Yonathan Portilla","affiliation":["University of Avignon, Avignon, FRANCE","INRIA, FRANCE"],"firstName":"Yonathan","lastName":"Portilla","id":"37072373900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5877-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6921600","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":207},"abstract":"The goal of this paper is to study the behaviour of viewcount in YouTube. We first propose several bio-inspired models for the evolution of the viewcount of YouTube videos. We show, using a large set of empirical data, that the viewcount for 90% of videos in YouTube can indeed be associated to at least one of these models, with a Mean Error which does not exceed 5%. We derive automatic ways of classifying the viewcount curve into one of these models and of extracting the most suitable parameters of the model. We study empirically the impact of videos' popularity and category on the evolution of its viewcount. We finally use the above classification along with the automatic parameters extraction in order to predict the evolution of videos' viewcount.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6911097/6921526/06921600.pdf","startPage":"297","endPage":"305","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014)","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921600","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921600","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6921526","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6921600","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bio-inspired models for characterizing YouTube viewcout","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Videos","YouTube","Mathematical model","Biological system modeling","Sociology","Statistics","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomimetics","pattern classification","regression analysis","social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinspired models","YouTube viewcout","YouTube videos","viewcount curve classification","video popularity","video category","automatic parameters extraction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Online videos","bio-inspired models","video popularity","regression model","popularity growth","popularity prediction"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921600/","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Bio-inspired models for characterizing YouTube viewcout","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6921600/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14683121","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"17-20 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bio-inspired models for characterizing YouTube viewcout","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"049A276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061676S","chronDate":"17-20 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6911097","isNumber":"6921526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6911097","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6921526","articleId":"6921600","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6921613,"authors":[{"name":"Adrien Guille","affiliation":["ERIC Lab, University of Lyon 2"],"firstName":"Adrien","lastName":"Guille","id":"37085439467"},{"name":"C\u00e9cile Favre","affiliation":["ERIC Lab, University of Lyon 2"],"firstName":"C\u00e9cile","lastName":"Favre","id":"38468124000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5877-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6921613","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":446},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Twitter","Event detection","Time-frequency analysis","Correlation","Conferences","Encyclopedias"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social networking (online)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mention-anomaly-based event detection","mention-anomaly-based event tracking","tweet textual content","MABED","English Twitter data","French Twitter data"]}],"abstract":"The ever-growing number of people using Twitter makes it a valuable source of timely information. However, detecting events in Twitter is a difficult task, because tweets that report interesting events are overwhelmed by a large volume of tweets on unrelated topics. Existing methods focus on the textual content of tweets and ignore the social aspect of Twitter. In this paper we propose MABED (Mention-Anomaly-Based Event Detection), a novel method that leverages the creation frequency of dynamic links (i.e. mentions) that users insert in tweets to detect important events and estimate the magnitude of their impact over the crowd. The main advantages of MABED over prior works are that (i) it relies solely on tweets, meaning no external knowledge is required, and that (ii) it dynamically estimates the period of time during which each event is discussed rather than assuming a predefined fixed duration. The experiments we conducted on both English and French Twitter data show that the mention-anomaly-based approach leads to more accurate event detection and improved robustness in presence of noisy Twitter content. Last, we show that MABED helps with the interpretation of detected events by providing clear and precise descriptions.","doi":"10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921613","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6911097/6921526/06921613.pdf","startPage":"375","endPage":"382","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ASONAM.2014.6921613","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6921526","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mention-anomaly-based Event Detection and tracking in Twitter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6921613","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"17-20 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921613/","displayDocTitle":"Mention-anomaly-based Event Detection and tracking in Twitter","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14683124","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6921613/","conferenceDate":"17-20 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mention-anomaly-based Event Detection and tracking in Twitter","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"062A257.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090261S","chronDate":"17-20 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6911097","isNumber":"6921526","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6911097","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6921526","articleId":"6921613","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6921655,"authors":[{"name":"Yantao Jia","affiliation":["CAS Key Laboratory of Network Data Science and Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, P.

To cover these shortages, we propose the open knowledge network (OpenKN), which is a self-adaptive and evolutionable knowledge computational engine for network big data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of designing the end-to-end and holistic knowledge processing pipeline in regard with the network big data.

In which the effect of (ISI) inter symbol interference is minimum. One of the major problem in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) System is high Peak -to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR). So the system requires high power amplifier with large dynamic range. It is very difficult to design such an amplifier with high efficiency. Many researchers working on PAPR reduction techniques, they proposed different methods; one of the simplest method is Clipping, Clipping and filtering. Other methods are Partial Transmit Sequence (PTS), Selective Mapping (SLM), Tone reservation (TR) etc. These are distortion less methods. In this paper we analyzed the PAPR reduction performance of OFDM system using both distortion and distortion less methods i.e.(i) Clipping (ii) Clipping and Filtering with different clipping Ratios (CR's) and(iii) PTS method with different number of sub locks. From simulation results clipping method shows good PAPR reduction with significant amount of BER degradation. Clipping and filtering method shows slight increase in PAPR with small degradation in BER performance than Clipping method and both methods are computationally less complex. PTS provides good PAPR reduction with high computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921809","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6915233/6921705/06921809.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921809","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6921705","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of PAPR reduction in OFDM system with distortion and distortion less methods","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6921809","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of PAPR reduction in OFDM system with distortion and distortion less methods","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921809/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14684380","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6921809/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of PAPR reduction in OFDM system with distortion and distortion less methods","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"EC365.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075958S","chronDate":"3-5 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6915233","isNumber":"6921705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915233","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6921705","articleId":"6921809","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6921829,"authors":[{"name":"Viswanathan Ramachandran","affiliation":["Electrical Department, University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Viswanathan","lastName":"Ramachandran","id":"37085434267"},{"name":"Alice Cheeran","affiliation":["Electrical Department, University of Mumbai, Mumbai, India"],"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Cheeran","id":"37076483300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2352-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2353-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6921829","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":329},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Compressed sensing","Feature extraction","Correlation","Vectors","Energy efficiency","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","compressed sensing","energy conservation","radio spectrum management","signal detection","signal sampling","telecommunication power management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio networks","energy efficiency","spectrum sensing","compressive sensing","dynamic spectrum access","DSA","fixed spectrum allocation policy","green wireless communications","conventional sampling","signal acquisition","compressive sampling","cyclostationary feature detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Spectrum Sensing","Energy Efficiency","Cyclostationary Feature Detection","Compressed Sensing"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6921829","doi":"10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICCCI.2014.6921829","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6921705","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Computer Communication and Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6915233/6921705/06921829.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improvement of energy efficiency of spectrum sensing algorithms for cognitive radio networks using compressive sensing technique","abstract":"Cognitive Radio (CR) is projected to be the next disruptive radio communications and networking technology and has already attracted considerable interest from researchers worldwide. CR follows the design philosophy of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) as opposed to a fixed spectrum allocation policy. The enabling technology for CR is spectrum sensing. However, spectrum sensing is one of the most complex and power intensive tasks in a cognitive radio system. Due to the emphasis on `Green Wireless Communications' recently, energy efficiency is an aspect that must be dealt with in practical CR systems. This is especially so in wideband CR networks which operate in the over GHz regime and consequently conventional sampling and signal acquisition becomes costly from a hardware point of view. Hence compressive sampling has been proposed for spectrum sensing in CR networks recently. This paper focuses on the application of compressed sensing techniques to cyclostationary feature detection in CR and the resulting improvement of energy efficiency.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921829/","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Jan. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"3-5 Jan. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6921829/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","accessionNumber":"14684353","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Improvement of energy efficiency of spectrum sensing algorithms for cognitive radio networks using compressive sensing technique","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improvement of energy efficiency of spectrum sensing algorithms for cognitive radio networks using compressive sensing technique","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"EC479.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064674S","chronDate":"3-5 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6915233","isNumber":"6921705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915233","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6921705","articleId":"6921829","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6921830,"authors":[{"name":"Prakash Kumar Rout","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Emgineering, NIT Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Prakash Kumar","lastName":"Rout","id":"38102554300"},{"name":"Debiprasad Priyabrata Acharya","affiliation":["Department of Electronics & Communication Emgineering, NIT Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Debiprasad Priyabrata","lastName":"Acharya","id":"37605095000"},{"name":"Ganapati Panda","affiliation":["School of Electrical Sciences, IIT, Bhubanswar, India"],"firstName":"Ganapati","lastName":"Panda","id":"37085421322"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2352-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-2353-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6921830","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":206},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","Ring oscillators","Phase noise","Optimization","Semiconductor device modeling","Integrated circuit modeling","Layout"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","CMOS analogue integrated circuits","genetic algorithms","integrated circuit design","oscillators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constrained multiobjective optimization","CMOS ring oscillator","nondominated sorting genetic algorithm","integrated circuit design","Cadence Virtuoso Analog Design Environment","GPDK process","size 90 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II)","CMOS Ring Oscillator (CMOS RO)","Analog and mixed signal (AMS) circuit"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a popular multiobjective optimization Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) based integrated circuit design methodology using simple equation models is presented.

Among its more notable strong points are on-demand reactive power support for the grid, better power quality, current limiting, management of distributed storage devices and a dc bus. Most of the nation's power grid currently operates one way - power flows from the utility to the consumer - and traditional transformers simply change voltage from one level to another. But smart transformers, based on power semiconductor switches, are more versatile. Not only can they change voltage levels, but also can effectively control the power flow in both directions. The development of a Solid State Transformer (SST) that incorporates a DC-DC multiport converter to integrate both photovoltaic (PV) power generation and battery energy storage is presented in this paper. The DC-DC stage is based on a quad active-bridge (QAB) converter which not only provides isolation for the load, but also for the PV and storage. The AC-DC stage is implemented with a pulse-width-modulated (PWM) single phase rectifier. A novel technique that complements the SISO controller by taking into account the cross coupling characteristics of the QAB converter is also presented herein. Cascaded SISO controllers are designed for the AC-DC stage. The QAB demanded power is calculated at the QAB controls and then fed into the rectifier controls in order to minimize the effect of the interaction between the two SST stages. The dynamic performance of the designed control loops based on the proposed control strategies are verified through extensive simulation of the SST average and switching models.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"3-5 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921847/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14684388","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","conferenceDate":"3-5 Jan. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6921847/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of multiport dc-dc converter-based Solid State Transformer in smart grid system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of multiport dc-dc converter-based Solid State Transformer in smart grid system","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"EE441.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057637S","chronDate":"3-5 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6915233","isNumber":"6921705","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915233","xplore-issue":"6921705","articleId":"6921847","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6921859,"authors":[{"name":"Francisco Serdio","affiliation":["Department of Knowledge-Based Mathematical Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Francisco","lastName":"Serdio","id":"37085366529"},{"name":"Alexandru-Ciprian Z\u0103voianu","affiliation":["Department of Knowledge-Based Mathematical Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Alexandru-Ciprian","lastName":"Z\u0103voianu","id":"37085394334"},{"name":"Edwin Lughofer","affiliation":["Department of Knowledge-Based Mathematical Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Edwin","lastName":"Lughofer","id":"37270778300"},{"name":"Kurt Pichler","affiliation":["Lin; Center of Mechatronics, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Kurt","lastName":"Pichler","id":"37698897500"},{"name":"Thomas Buchegger","affiliation":["Lin; Center of Mechatronics, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Buchegger","id":"37264962200"},{"name":"Hajrudin Efendic","affiliation":["Institute for Design and Control of Mechatronical Systems, Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Hajrudin","lastName":"Efendic","id":"38202146200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5937-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5936-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6921859","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":53},"abstract":"We demonstrate how Residual-Based Fault Detection can be improved by means of Genetic-Fuzzy Systems (GFSs).

This paper investigates a recently proposed technique to improve generalisation in GP, termed Interleaved Sampling where GP alternates between using the entire data set and only a single data point in alternate generations. This paper proposes two alternatives to using a single data point: the use of random search instead of a single data point, and simply minimising the tree size. Both the approaches are more efficient than the original Interleaved Sampling because they simply do not evaluate the fitness in half the number of generations. The results show that in terms of generalisation, random search and size minimisation are as effective as the original Interleaved Sampling; however, they are computationally more efficient in terms of data processing. Size minimisation is particularly interesting because it completely prevents bloat while still being competitive in terms of training results as well as generalisation. The tree sizes with size minimisation are substantially smaller reducing the computational expense substantially.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921874/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6921874/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14666653","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient approaches to interleaved sampling of training data for symbolic regression","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient approaches to interleaved sampling of training data for symbolic regression","confLoc":"Porto","sourcePdf":"paper39.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064644S","chronDate":"July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912307","isNumber":"6921848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912307","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6921848","articleId":"6921874","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6921880,"authors":[{"name":"Sebasti\u00e1n Basterrech","affiliation":["IT4Innovations, V\u0160B-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Sebasti\u00e1n","lastName":"Basterrech","id":"38581142800"},{"name":"Enrique Alba","affiliation":["IT4Innovations, V\u0160B-Technical University of Ostrava, Ostrava-Poruba, Czech Republic","Dept.

An ESN is a Recurrent Neural Network with the hidden-hidden weights fixed in the learning process. The recurrent part of the network stores the input information in internal states of the network. Another structure forms a free-memory method used as supervised learning tool. The setting procedure for initializing the recurrent structure of the ESN model can impact on the model performance. On the other hand, the PSO has been shown to be a successful technique for finding optimal points in complex spaces. Here, we present an approach to use the PSO for finding some initial hidden-hidden weights of the ESN model. We present empirical results that compare the canonical ESN model with this hybrid method on a wide range of benchmark problems.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921880/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14666627","htmlLink":"/document/6921880/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An experimental analysis of the Echo State Network initialization using the Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An experimental analysis of the Echo State Network initialization using the Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"paper45.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.079919S","chronDate":"July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912307","isNumber":"6921848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912307","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6921848","articleId":"6921880","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6921893,"authors":[{"name":"Angelo M.

A multiobjective genetic algorithm (SPEA2) improved using fuzzy logic is presented to solve the VOLT/THD problem, since it is a combinatorial multiobjective optimization problem. The expert knowledge is taken into account via fuzzy logic in order to reduce the search space using voltage regulators in standard units. According to the multiobjective optimization fundamentals, an optimal solution ensemble is obtained, which concomitantly represents the solutions to both objectives, in such way that the operational restrictions of systems are satisfied. Two objectives have been established: voltage level deviation and total harmonic distortion. An algorithm is applied to harmonic analysis in radial systems, with application of models compatible with practical data. The algorithm is evaluated for a known 34-bus feeder in the literature of the subject.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","Algorithm design and analysis","Voltage control","Harmonic filters","Biological cells","Sociology","Statistics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution networks","fuzzy logic","genetic algorithms","harmonic distortion","power harmonic filters","voltage regulators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution system","integrated voltage","harmonics distortion control","radial distribution feeders","automatic voltage regulators","AVR","harmonic passive filters","multiobjective genetic algorithm","SPEA2","fuzzy logic","total harmonic distortion","VOLT/THD problem","combinatorial multiobjective optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiobjective Optimization","Fuzzy Logic","Distribution Systems","Voltage Regulator","Harmonic Filter"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6921893","doi":"10.1109/NaBIC.2014.6921893","startPage":"287","endPage":"292","publicationTitle":"2014 Sixth World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Sixth World Congress on Nature and Biologically Inspired Computing (NaBIC 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6912307/6921848/06921893.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6921848","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NaBIC.2014.6921893","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6921893/","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective optimization for Volt/Thd oroblem in distribution system","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14666655","htmlLink":"/document/6921893/","conferenceDate":"30 July-1 Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective optimization for Volt/Thd oroblem in distribution system","confLoc":"Porto, Portugal","sourcePdf":"paper60.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077013S","chronDate":"July 30 2014-Aug. 1 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912307","isNumber":"6921848","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912307","xplore-issue":"6921848","articleId":"6921893","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6921898,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Therefore it is a relatively new signal processing technique for systems with multiple transmit antennas and multiple receives antennas, to increase capacity in wireless communications without sacrificing bandwidth.

The smart antenna array consists of microstrip patch antenna with the inclusion of Butler matrix and the performance of the antenna is improved from the obtained simulation results in Advanced design System (ADS).","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Dec. 2013","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922002/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14684571","publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","conferenceDate":"18-20 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6922002/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of microstrip patch array antenna using beamforming technique for ISM Band","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of microstrip patch array antenna using beamforming technique for ISM Band","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"085145icoac13.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05291S","chronDate":"18-20 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6915272","isNumber":"6921901","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915272","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6921901","articleId":"6922002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6922049,"authors":[{"name":"Nalaka Arjuna Premathilaka","affiliation":["Department of Computing, University of Westminster Colombo, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Nalaka Arjuna","lastName":"Premathilaka","id":"37085421372"},{"name":"Achala Chathuranga Aponso","affiliation":["Department of Computing, University of Westminster Colombo, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Achala Chathuranga","lastName":"Aponso","id":"38228553000"},{"name":"Naomi Krishnarajah","affiliation":["Department of Computing, University of Westminster Colombo, Sri Lanka"],"firstName":"Naomi","lastName":"Krishnarajah","id":"38228552600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-0889-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2153-0742"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1071-6572"}],"articleNumber":"6922049","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":590},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intrusion detection","Cloud computing","Computer architecture","Monitoring","Computers","Servers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["intrusion detection systems","cloud computing","computer system capability","computer system usability","computer system scalability","IDS","malicious activities","malicious attacks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Intrusion Detection System","Computer System Security","Cloud Security","Network based IDS","Host based IDS","Intrusion detection system for cloud computing"]}],"abstract":"Cloud Computing is an emerging technology that enhances capability, usability and scalability of computer systems.

It uses switches, capacitors and a simple gm-cell, rather than opamps, thus being compatible with digital nanoscale technology. In the voltage-sampling mode, the gm-cell is bypassed so the filter is fully passive. A 7th-order filter prototype operating at 800 MS/s sampling rate is implemented in TSMC 65 nm CMOS. Bandwidth of this filter is programmable between 400 kHz to 30 MHz with 100 dB maximum stop-band rejection. Its IIP3 is +21 dBm and the averaged spot noise is 4.57 nV/\u221aHz.

The active TX leakage cancellation circuitry is embedded within a noise-cancelling low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) so that the noise and the distortion of the cancellation circuitry are cancelled, resulting in a noise-cancelling, self-interference cancelling receiver (NC-SIC RX). A second-point cancellation of TX noise in the RX band is performed after the LNTA so that the noise impact of the second canceller is reduced. Theoretical analyses related to the benefits and limits of active self-interference cancellation as well as the simultaneous cancellation of the noise and distortion of the cancellation circuitry are presented. A 0.3-1.7 GHz receiver with the proposed active cancellation is implemented in 65 nm CMOS. The proposed scheme can cancel up to +2 dBm peak TX leakage at the receiver input. The triple beat at +2 dBm peak TX leakage is 68 dB and the effective IIP3 is +33 dBm, representing increases of 38 and 19 dB, respectively, over the receiver without cancellation. The associated increase in receiver NF is less than 0.8 dB. In addition, the scheme effectively suppresses TX noise in RX band by up to 13 dB. The technique can be more generally viewed as an active combining structure that has ideally no noise penalty and is able to handle large signals without generating distortion and can be applied to any scenario where a replica of an interference signal can be generated.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low-Noise Active Cancellation of Transmitter Leakage and Transmitter Noise in Broadband Wireless Receivers for FDD/Co-Existence","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2014.2359914","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6963535/06922161.pdf","startPage":"3046","endPage":"3062","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2014.2359914","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6963535","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6922161","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922161/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Low-Noise Active Cancellation of Transmitter Leakage and Transmitter Noise in Broadband Wireless Receivers for FDD/Co-Existence","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"49","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6922161/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14759553","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low-Noise Active Cancellation of Transmitter Leakage and Transmitter Noise in Broadband Wireless Receivers for FDD/Co-Existence","sourcePdf":"jssc-krishnaswamy-2359914-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120615S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6963535","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"6963535","articleId":"6922161","onlineDate":"13 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6922162,"authors":[{"name":"Jussi H.

Interconnect power dissipation is a major challenging research problem in deep submicron (DSM) regime that affects the overall circuit performance. The Buffer Insertion, (Buffer) Sizing and Wire Sizing (BISWS) are considered for minimizing the power dissipation using interconnect wires. The shortest path constraints, buffer insert constraints and wire size constraints are considered for analysis the optimal power allocation is derived.

In the field of computer security, ease of access of data by the authorized users is a major area of consideration. In addition to this, the protection of personal data from unauthenticated users is also a major challenge. In an earlier paper, an emerging non-static biometric technique was examined that aims to identify users based on the scrutiny of their habitual rhythm patterns in typing. Some features relating to time and depression of keys such as the duration of typed keys, latency between two consecutive keystrokes, Digraph, and Tri-graph were taken into account thus making the authentication depend upon the extracted features. In addition to these time related features, Virtual Key Force (VKF) is added as an additional feature for authentication. In the subsequent paper, a unique technique for authentication is adopted in key stroke dynamics by extracting different features of the user's rhythm in typing a text in the keyboard. The features extracted in the PSO methodology adopted are from the emotions of the users while typing the text. The feature selection for the proposed method uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Typing rhythms are the rawest form of data stemming from the interaction between users and computers. When properly sampled and analyzed, they may become a useful tool to ascertain personal identity. Unlike other access control systems based on biometric features, keystroke analysis has not led to techniques providing an acceptable level of accuracy.

Montgomery multiplication is one of the fastest methods available for performing modular multiplication. A k - partition method for Montgomery multiplication is thoroughly studied and analysed.

To overcome these problems, Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices have been implemented in power system. By placing these devices in suitable locations, the power system can be operated far away from the instability point. In this paper, the optimal location and the ratings of FACTS devices such as Thyristor Controlled Series Capacitor (TCSC), Static VAR Compensator (SVC) and Unified Power Flow Controller (UPFC) are determined using Genetic Algorithm (GA). A multi objective optimization problem is formulated with the consideration of minimizing voltage stability index, real power loss and generator cost. Evolutionary algorithm such as GA is a population based search method is used for solving multi objective optimization problem that is capable of searching for multiple solutions concurrently in a single run and provide an optimal solution. It is observed from the results that the voltages stability index, real power loss and generator cost are reduced by optimally locating the FACTS devices in the power system.

However, most controller design approaches are based on linear models. Although linear model based control methods are well established, they don't give satisfactory control performance, when the controlled process is highly non-linear. The non-linearities of practical processes are normally very complex. It is quite difficult to derive complete knowledge of such non-linearities. In this paper nonlinear process such as a spherical tank system is taken as for study. The transfer function of the spherical tank system is obtained in real time by Black box modeling method. GA based FLC is developed for a level control of spherical tank process at lower region. Here the conventional FLC is designed and its servo response is compared with GA based FLC based on IAE and ISE as objective function. The proposed controller was simulated by MATLAB using the technique of PI type FLC whose membership function, fuzzy logic rules and scaling gains were optimized by the genetic algorithm technique. Simulated results show a considerable improvement in rising time and settling time besides reduces overshoot, IAE and ISE.","doi":"10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6922371","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6900020/6920919/06922371.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6922371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of genetic algorithm based optimal fuzzy logic controller for a non linear process","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Genetic algorithms","Fuzzy logic","Process control","Sociology","Statistics","Biological cells","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","fuzzy control","genetic algorithms","linear systems","nonlinear control systems","optimal control","transfer functions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm based optimal fuzzy logic controller design","nonlinear process","nonlinear behavior","linear model based control methods","spherical tank system","transfer function","black box modeling method","GA based FLC","level control","servo response","IAE","ISE","objective function","Matlab","PI type FLC technique","membership function","fuzzy logic rules","scaling gains"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FLC","Genetic Algorithm","IAE","ISE","Spherical tank"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922371/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Design of genetic algorithm based optimal fuzzy logic controller for a non linear process","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6922371/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14665764","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of genetic algorithm based optimal fuzzy logic controller for a non linear process","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"218.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089585S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6900020","isNumber":"6920919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6900020","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6920919","articleId":"6922371","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6922392,"authors":[{"name":"Chiranjibi Samal","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical Engg., National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Chiranjibi","lastName":"Samal","id":"37085533454"},{"name":"Lopamudra Samal","affiliation":["Dept.

It has become a very useful medical modality for the detection of various diseases through segmentation methods. In this paper, we have presented an effective CNN based segmentation method with lung and brain MRI images. This approach hits the target with the aid of the following major steps, which includes, 1) Preprocessing of the brain and lung images, 2) Segmentation using cellular neural network. Initially, the MRI image is pre-processed to make it fit for segmentation. Here, in the pre-processing step, image de-noising is done using the linear smoothing filters, such as Gaussian Filter. Then, the pre-processed image is segmented according to our proposed technique, CNN-based image segmentation. Finally, the different MRI images (brain and lung) are given to the proposed approach to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach in segmentation process. The Comparative analysis is carried out Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and K-means classification. From the comparative analysis, the accuracy of proposed segmentation approach produces better results (83.7% for lung and 93% for brain images) than that of existing Fuzzy C-means (FCM) and K-means classification.","doi":"10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6922413","pdfPath":"/iel7/6900020/6920919/06922413.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6922413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920919","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"cellular neural network based medical image segmentation using artificial bee colony algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922413/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"cellular neural network based medical image segmentation using artificial bee colony algorithm","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14665986","publicationDate":"March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6922413/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"cellular neural network based medical image segmentation using artificial bee colony algorithm","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"260.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081835S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6900020","isNumber":"6920919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6900020","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6920919","articleId":"6922413","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6922417,"authors":[{"name":"S.

A cloud is an aggregation of resources or services that are provided as service through network. In earlier version of cloud computing (grid computing) it was enough to find the subset of resources for the applications whereas cloud computing goes one step higher allocating resources to Virtual Machines (VM's) as well as scheduling tasks on the VM's. So resource scheduling is indispensable in cloud computing for load balancing and maximizing the utilization while minimizing the execution time and energy. Few approaches relating to energy salvation have certain disadvantages such as, time complexity and slow Convergence. Hence Energy-Aware Multi objective Chiropteran Algorithm (EAMOCA) is developed by bringing together the echo-localization and hibernation properties for scheduling resources as well as conserving energy. Promotion of energy salvation in cloud environment is achieved in a well delineated manner. By using the performance metrics such as total energy consumed by physical resources, SLA violation (CPU performance) and VM migration, we have manipulated our approach through real time implementation by setting up a private cloud employing VMware.","doi":"10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6922463","publicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Conference on Green Computing Communication and Electrical Engineering (ICGCCEE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6900020/6920919/06922463.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICGCCEE.2014.6922463","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6920919","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A bio inspired Energy-Aware Multi objective Chiropteran Algorithm (EAMOCA) for hybrid cloud computing environment","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6922463","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A bio inspired Energy-Aware Multi objective Chiropteran Algorithm (EAMOCA) for hybrid cloud computing environment","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922463/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14666044","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6922463/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A bio inspired Energy-Aware Multi objective Chiropteran Algorithm (EAMOCA) for hybrid cloud computing environment","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069879S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6900020","isNumber":"6920919","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6900020","citationCount":"56","xplore-issue":"6920919","articleId":"6922463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6922465,"authors":[{"name":"Tejaswini P.

Predictive results of high accuracy were achieved (normalized root-mean-square errors of below 0.6% in all cases), even for the square-slot patch modeling problem where all antenna dimensions and parameters were allowed to vary, resulting in a seven-dimensional input space. Training data requirements for achieving these accuracies were relatively modest. Furthermore, the automatic relevance determination property of GPR provided (at no additional cost) a mechanism for enhancing qualitative understanding of the antennas' resonance characteristics-a facility not offered by neural network-based strategies used in related studies.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2014.2362937","startPage":"337","endPage":"341","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/7727/7024204/06922487.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2014.2362937","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7024204","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Resonant Frequency Modeling for Dual-Band Microstrip Antennas by Gaussian Process Regression","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resonant frequency","Microstrip antennas","Gaussian processes","Ground penetrating radar","Microstrip","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","mean square error methods","microstrip antennas","multifrequency antennas","regression analysis","slot antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["efficient resonant frequency modeling","dual-band microstrip antennas","Gaussian process regression","GPR","U-slot patch","center square slot","normalized root-mean-square errors","square-slot patch modeling problem","antenna dimensions","antenna parameters","automatic relevance determination property"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Antennas","Gaussian processes","modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922487/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"2015","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Resonant Frequency Modeling for Dual-Band Microstrip Antennas by Gaussian Process Regression","volume":"14","htmlLink":"/document/6922487/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"2015","dateOfInsertion":"04 February 2015","accessionNumber":"14914032","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Resonant Frequency Modeling for Dual-Band Microstrip Antennas by Gaussian Process Regression","sourcePdf":"lawp-jacobs-2362937-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040785S","chronDate":"2015","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"7024204","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7024204","articleId":"6922487","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-21"},{"_id":6922488,"authors":[{"name":"Md.

Using the layered decoding algorithm, the decoder achieves a better performance than the message-passing algorithm; the extrinsic-message storing is switched from variable node based to check node based. Then, using the normalized min-sum (NMS) algorithm, the extrinsic messages can be reduced to the first and second minimum absolute values, the position index of the first minimum absolute value, the signs of all extrinsic messages, and the product of all the signs. A memory-based application-specific integrated circuit architecture of the LDPC-CC decoder that supports these methods is proposed for the IEEE 1901 standard. Based on a SMIC 130-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor process, a decoder that can support all the code rates of the LDPC-CCs defined in IEEE 1901 (1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5) is fabricated and evaluated.

The proposed STPR-ML achieves a 2 ~ 8\u00d7 reduction in area compared with CMOS logic gates with four or more inputs.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6922503/","dateOfInsertion":"01 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14836026","volume":"62","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Set-Triggered-Parallel-Reset Memristor Logic for High-Density Heterogeneous-Integration Friendly Normally Off Applications","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Set-Triggered-Parallel-Reset Memristor Logic for High-Density Heterogeneous-Integration Friendly Normally Off Applications","sourcePdf":"tcsii-chang-2362713-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0886S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7001113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"7001113","articleId":"6922503","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6922505,"authors":[{"name":"Soon-Jae Kweon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Mobile Sensor and IT Convergence Center, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Soon-Jae","lastName":"Kweon","id":"37085536677"},{"name":"Soo-Hwan Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Mobile Sensor and IT Convergence Center, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Soo-Hwan","lastName":"Shin","id":"37085542977"},{"name":"Sung-Hun Jo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Mobile Sensor and IT Convergence Center, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Sung-Hun","lastName":"Jo","id":"37085530961"},{"name":"Hyung-Joun Yoo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and the Mobile Sensor and IT Convergence Center, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Hyung-Joun","lastName":"Yoo","id":"37274307200"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6922505","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1049},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"abstract":"A charge sampler-based reconfigurable high-order moving-average (MA) filter designed using a temporal MA method is proposed. The proposed filter has a higher gain than conventional MA filters. Moreover, the filter supports variable sizes and orders of MA.

The N and M are easily controlled by changing the clock patterns; therefore, the filter is suitable for multimode transceivers. To minimize the power consumption, inverter-based transconductance amplifiers are used.

robust start-up. The chip was implemented using the 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS technology. A source degeneration coupling technique is used to generate quadrature signals and enables the elimination of bimodal oscillation. Capacitive degeneration coupling also provides negative impedance to compensate for losses in the LC tank, resulting in less power consumption in the core circuit to sustain oscillation. The proposed 2.4-GHz QVCO design achieves a 13.46% tuning range and a phase noise of -128.65 dBc/Hz at a 1-MHz offset while only consuming 2.67 mW from a 1.8-V supply. The oscillator demonstrated robust operation from -25 \u00b0C to 85 \u00b0C with phase noise lower than -122 dBc/Hz at a 1-MHz offset. The proposed QVCO achieves a remarkable figure of merit of -192 dBc/Hz.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2014.2362714","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2014.2362714","startPage":"16","endPage":"20","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7001113/06922507.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness Enhancement of a Class-C Quadrature Oscillator Using Capacitive Source Degeneration Coupling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Robustness Enhancement of a Class-C Quadrature Oscillator Using Capacitive Source Degeneration Coupling","volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14836027","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6922507/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004663","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan","grantNumber":"100-2218-E-009-030-MY3 and 102-2221-E-009-193-MY3"},{"fundingName":"National Chip Implementation Center, Taiwan"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness Enhancement of a Class-C Quadrature Oscillator Using Capacitive Source Degeneration Coupling","sourcePdf":"tcsii-liao-2362714-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079345S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7001113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"7001113","articleId":"6922507","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6922514,"authors":[{"name":"Youngjoo Lee","affiliation":["Interuniversity Microelectronics Center (IMEC), Leuven, Belgium"],"firstName":"Youngjoo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37085562856"},{"name":"Bongjin Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Bongjin","lastName":"Kim","id":"37534757000"},{"name":"Jaehwan Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"Jaehwan","lastName":"Jung","id":"37074794100"},{"name":"In-Cheol Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, Korea"],"firstName":"In-Cheol","lastName":"Park","id":"37270580300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-7747"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-3791"}],"articleNumber":"6922514","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":840},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiplexing","Delays","Computer architecture","Decoding","Complexity theory","Parity check codes","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit complexity","decoding","parity check codes","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-complexity tree architecture","area-efficient tree architecture","low-density parity-check decoder","min-sum algorithm","comparators","area-time complexity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Area-efficient design","Digital integrated circuits","LDPC codes","Minimum value generation","Tree structure"]},{"kwd":["Area-efficient design","digital integrated circuits","low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes","minimum value generation","tree structure"]}],"abstract":"This brief presents an area-efficient tree architecture for finding the first two minima as well as the index of the first minimum, which is essential in the design of a low-density parity-check decoder based on the min-sum algorithm.

The power and phase compression of 90\u00b0, 45\u00b0, and 22.5\u00b0 phase shifters are analyzed, and the phase shifters are optimally cascaded for high power and phase compression points. The measured insertion loss of the 4-bit phase shifter is -25 \u00b1 2.1 dB, and the root mean square (RMS) gain error of the 16 different phase states is 1.1 dB at 77 GHz. An input and output return loss is less than -8 dB at 70-85 GHz. The phase shifter has the RMS phase error of 7.20 at 77 GHz and is less than 11.25\u00b0 at 75-85 GHz. The measured minimum 1-dB power compression point of 16 different phase states is 15.0 dBm. The high input power also compresses the phase adjustment range and increases the phase error, which is limited to 11.25\u00b0 up to the input power of 21 dBm.

The derivative of the input is level-crossing sampled, and the result is transmitted; at the receiver, these samples are zero-order held and integrated, automatically resulting in piecewise-linear reconstruction, which has much lower quantization error than zero-order-hold (ZOH) reconstruction. Two refinements are presented, namely companded DLCS and adaptive-resolution DLCS. For some signals, the schemes proposed can significantly reduce the number of samples generated per unit of time, compared to schemes based on ZOH reconstruction, for a given signal-to-error ratio (SER), without the need for elaborate reconstruction techniques, such as linear prediction. Contrary to Nyquist-rate-clocked systems, DLCS and its variants exploit the varying spectral context and sparse structure of bursty signals by generating samples only when the signal rate of change requires it, thus promising to lead to low dynamic power dissipation in the associated hardware. Simulation results are presented.","doi":"10.1109/TCSII.2014.2362742","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSII.2014.2362742","startPage":"11","endPage":"15","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","pdfPath":"/iel7/8920/7001113/06922520.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001113","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Derivative Level-Crossing Sampling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Derivative Level-Crossing Sampling","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","volume":"62","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6922520/","accessionNumber":"14836018","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922520/","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0964606"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Derivative Level-Crossing Sampling","sourcePdf":"tcsii-martineznuevo-2362742-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057511S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"7001113","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"7001113","articleId":"6922520","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6922523,"authors":[{"name":"Jiajing Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Information Engineering, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Jiajing","lastName":"Wu","id":"38468849800"},{"name":"Chi K.

This criterion has been shown to be fundamental. The key design problem is therefore to find the optimal solution that achieves this criterion.

In this paper, a voltage-balancing method is proposed for the MMC switched at grid frequency with reduced losses and does not rely on the arm current. By assigning the low-frequency pulses with different pulsewidths, the capacitor charge transfer in the MMC can be controlled for keeping the capacitor voltage balancing in the MMC. Simulations and experimental studies of the MMC are conducted, and the results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed capacitor voltage-balancing method.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage-Balancing Method for Modular Multilevel Converters Switched at Grid Frequency","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2362881","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7080969/06922530.pdf","startPage":"2835","endPage":"2847","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2362881","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080969","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6922530","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922530/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"Voltage-Balancing Method for Modular Multilevel Converters Switched at Grid Frequency","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6922530/","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15036018","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage-Balancing Method for Modular Multilevel Converters Switched at Grid Frequency","sourcePdf":"tie-deng-2362881-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093369S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7080969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7080969","articleId":"6922530","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6922532,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["Opal-RT Technologies, Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7080969/6922532/li-2362879-small.gif","p":["\nWei Li (M'06) was born in Hangzhou, China.

Many methods of submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balance control (VBC) require knowing the gating signals and are therefore also implemented in the same FPGA. As the number of SMs in an MMC increases, both the latency and required resources for the implementation could become too large to meet the control requirements or fit into the FPGA. Conventional methods impose a limitation on the design of large MMC. This paper presents a pulse generation and VBC method that is optimized for FPGA implementation. With least comparison operation, this method produces the same valve voltage as other modulation methods, and it removes the need for a sorting operation in VBC, which is the main difficulty in FPGA implementation. The proposed method is implemented in the FPGA-based RT-LAB real-time simulator and tested in a hardware-in-the-loop setup. The performance of this method is validated in various tests.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7080969/06922532.pdf","startPage":"2859","endPage":"2867","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Modular Multilevel Converter Pulse Generation and Capacitor Voltage Balance Method Optimized for FPGA Implementation","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2362879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2362879","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6922532","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922532/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","displayDocTitle":"A Modular Multilevel Converter Pulse Generation and Capacitor Voltage Balance Method Optimized for FPGA Implementation","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15036021","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6922532/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Modular Multilevel Converter Pulse Generation and Capacitor Voltage Balance Method Optimized for FPGA Implementation","sourcePdf":"tie-li-2362879-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079878S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7080969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7080969","articleId":"6922532","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6922535,"authors":[{"name":"Zhen Wang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, School of Geography, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7001732/6922535/wang-2359951-small.gif","p":["\nZhen Wang is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in geography with\nthe Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.","His research interests include the application of light detection and ranging in classification of the ground objects\nand 3-D urban modeling."]},"firstName":"Zhen","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085409589"},{"name":"Liqiang Zhang","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Remote Sensing Science, School of Geography, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7001732/6922535/zhang-2359951-small.gif","p":["\nLiqiang Zhang received the Ph.D. degree in geoinformatics from the\nChinese Academy of Science's Institute of Remote Sensing Applications, Beijing, China, in 2004.","He is currently a Professor with the School of Geography, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, China.

However, the challenge of how to obtain robust and discriminative features from noisy and varying density TLS point clouds remains. This paper introduces a novel multiscale and hierarchical framework, which describes the classification of TLS point clouds of cluttered urban scenes. In this framework, we propose multiscale and hierarchical point clusters (MHPCs). In MHPCs, point clouds are first resampled into different scales. Then, the resampled data set of each scale is aggregated into several hierarchical point clusters, where the point cloud of all scales in each level is termed a point-cluster set. This representation not only accounts for the multiscale properties of point clouds but also well captures their hierarchical structures. Based on the MHPCs, novel features of point clusters are constructed by employing the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). An LDA model is trained according to a training set. The LDA model then extracts a set of latent topics, i.e., a feature of topics, for a point cluster. Finally, to apply the introduced features for point-cluster classification, we train an AdaBoost classifier in each point-cluster set and obtain the corresponding classifiers to separate the TLS point clouds with varying point density and data missing into semantic regions. Compared with other methods, our features achieve the best classification results for buildings, trees, people, and cars from TLS point clouds, particularly for small and moving objects, such as people and cars.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2359951","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7001732/06922535.pdf","startPage":"2409","endPage":"2425","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2359951","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001732","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Multiscale and Hierarchical Feature Extraction Method for Terrestrial Laser Scanning Point Cloud Classification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6922535","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922535/","displayDocTitle":"A Multiscale and Hierarchical Feature Extraction Method for Terrestrial Laser Scanning Point Cloud Classification","volume":"53","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"14840206","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6922535/","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"41371324"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Multiscale and Hierarchical Feature Extraction Method for Terrestrial Laser Scanning Point Cloud Classification","sourcePdf":"tgrs-zhang-2359951-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105406S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7001732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"101","xplore-issue":"7001732","articleId":"6922535","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6922539,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad R.

The design is to keep the message secret to the ERs while maximizing the information rate at the IR and meeting the energy harvesting constraints at the ERs. Technically, our objective is to optimize the information-bearing beam and artificial noise energy beam for maximizing the secrecy rate of the IR subject to individual harvested energy constraints of the ERs for the case where the ERs can collude to perform joint decoding in an attempt to illicitly decode the secret message to the IR. As a by-product, we also solve the total power minimization problem subject to secrecy rate and energy harvesting constraints. Both scenarios of perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter are addressed. For the imperfect CSI case, we study both eavesdroppers' channel covariance-based and worst case-based designs. Using semidefinite relaxation (SDR) techniques, we show that there always exists a rank-one optimal transmit covariance solution for the IR. Furthermore, if the SDR results in a higher rank solution, we propose an efficient algorithm to always construct an equivalent rank-one optimal solution. Computer simulations are carried out to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2363033","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6973056/06922539.pdf","startPage":"40","endPage":"54","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2363033","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6973056","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Masked Beamforming in the Presence of Energy-Harvesting Eavesdroppers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6922539","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922539/","displayDocTitle":"Masked Beamforming in the Presence of Energy-Harvesting Eavesdroppers","volume":"10","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","accessionNumber":"14786925","isOpenAccess":true,"isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6922539/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000266","fundingName":"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council","grantNumber":"EP/K015893/1"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Masked Beamforming in the Presence of Energy-Harvesting Eavesdroppers","sourcePdf":"tifs-khandaker-2363033-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.11285S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6973056","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"73","xplore-issue":"6973056","articleId":"6922539","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"CCBY","lastupdate":"2021-10-19"},{"_id":6922542,"authors":[{"name":"G\u00fcnther Koliander","affiliation":["Institute of Telecommunications, Vienna University of Technology, Vienna, Austria"],"bio":{"p":["G\u00fcnther Koliander (S\u201913) received the Master degree in Technical Mathematics (with distinction) from Vienna University of Technology, Austria, in 2011.

In general, actuation by the electromagnetic attractive force causes a tradeoff problem between the thrust force and the stroke because the thrust force depends on the gap between the electromagnet and the armature; an increase in the gap (stroke) drastically degrades the thrust force. To realize a submillimeter stroke while retaining a high thrust force, a structure that adopts a displacement amplification mechanism is proposed, which is often used to expand the stroke of a piezoelectric actuator. First, the electromagnetic attractive force is theoretically examined with and without displacement amplification. We verify that displacement amplification could create a higher thrust force and energy efficiency over a certain displacement. On the basis of this examination, a prototype actuator is designed, and the driving principle is illustrated. Further, an analytical model of the proposed actuator is developed for control and performance estimation. Several fundamental experiments with a developed actuator are performed in order to reveal the potential of the proposed actuator. The performance evaluations show that the maximum stroke is approximately 450 \u03bcm and a bandwidth greater than 300 Hz can be realized, and more a time constant is approximately 2 ms for a stroke of 450 \u03bcm. In addition, the experimental results were compared with the simulation results calculated from the analytical model to verify whether the prototype drives predictably according to the proposed concept under a dynamic situation. These results demonstrate that the proposed actuator enables good actuation performance, and it implies that there are tremendous advantages from the viewpoints of manufacturing, assembly, control, etc.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Actuators","Force","Prototypes","Electromagnetics","Fasteners","Analytical models","Coils"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic actuators","electromagnetic forces","piezoelectric actuators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic actuator","displacement amplification mechanism","linear actuator","electromagnetic attractive force actuation","submillimeter stroke","thrust force","electromagnet","armature","piezoelectric actuator","energy efficiency","prototype actuator","driving principle","actuator analytical model","performance estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Displacement amplification mechanism","electromagnetic actuator","electromagnetic attractive force","linear actuator"]},{"kwd":["Displacement amplification mechanism","electromagnetic actuator","electromagnetic attractive force","linear actuator"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2014.2360316","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/3516/7177156/06922549.pdf","startPage":"1607","endPage":"1615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7177156","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2014.2360316","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Electromagnetic Actuator Based on Displacement Amplification Mechanism","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6922549","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Electromagnetic Actuator Based on Displacement Amplification Mechanism","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922549/","volume":"20","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Aug. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6922549/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15360391","dateOfInsertion":"04 August 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"JSPS KAKENHI","grantNumber":"25\u2026297"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Electromagnetic Actuator Based on Displacement Amplification Mechanism","sourcePdf":"tmech-nabae-2360316-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06686S","chronDate":"Aug.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"7177156","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7177156","articleId":"6922549","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6922558,"authors":[{"name":"Mark A.

Rising electricity costs are forcing data center operators to either operate within an electricity budget or to reduce electricity use as much as possible while still maintaining service agreements. Energy-aware resource allocation is one technique a system administrator can employ to address both problems: optimizing the workload completion time (makespan) when given an energy budget, or to minimize energy consumption subject to service guarantees (such as adhering to deadlines). In this paper, we study the problem of energy-aware static resource allocation in an environment where a collection of independent (non-communicating) tasks (\u201cbag-of-tasks\u201d) is assigned to a heterogeneous computing system. Computing systems often operate in environments where task execution times vary (e.g., due to cache misses or data dependent execution times). We model these execution times stochastically, using probability density functions. We want our resource allocations to be robust against these variations, where we define \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">energy-robustness</i>\n as the probability that the energy budget is not violated, and \n<italic xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> makespan-robustness</i>\n as the probability a makespan deadline is not violated. We develop and analyze several heuristics for energy-aware resource allocation for both energy-constrained and deadline-constrained problems.","doi":"10.1109/TPDS.2014.2362921","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/71/7244274/06922558.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPDS.2014.2362921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7244274","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"2791","endPage":"2805","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/71/7244274/6922558-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Makespan and Energy Robust Stochastic Static Resource Allocation of a Bag-of-Tasks to a Heterogeneous Computing System","volume":"26","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/6922558/","dateOfInsertion":"07 September 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"1 Oct. 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922558/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct. 1 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"CNS-0615170, CNS-0905399 and CCF-1302693"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100007235","fundingName":"Colorado State University"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-0923386"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Makespan and Energy Robust Stochastic Static Resource Allocation of a Bag-of-Tasks to a Heterogeneous Computing System","sourcePdf":"tpds-oxley-2362921-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.131245S","chronDate":"Oct. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"71","isNumber":"7244274","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"7244274","articleId":"6922558","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6922578,"authors":[{"name":"Veikko Puumala","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Veikko Puumala received the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland, in 2012, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering."]},"firstName":"Veikko","lastName":"Puumala","id":"37085479774"},{"name":"Lauri Kettunen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland"],"bio":{"p":["Lauri Kettunen received the Dr.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from Tampere University of Technology, Tampere, Finland, in 1992.","Currently, he is a Professor of Electromagnetics at Tampere University of Technology."]},"firstName":"Lauri","lastName":"Kettunen","id":"37297262500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"6922578","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":415},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Coils","Contacts","Conductors","Force","Switches","Power conversion","Current measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic induction","electromechanical actuators","switchgear"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic design","ultrafast electromechanical switches","electromagnetic force","current-carrying conductor loop","power conversion efficiency","kinetic form","inductive coupling","series connected coil","high-speed camera","distance 1 mm","time 50 mus"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Acceleration","electromagnetic launching","energy conversion","switches"]}],"abstract":"To open electromechanical switches within the range of tens of microseconds, we exploit repulsive electromagnetic forces between current-carrying conductor loops.

We consider a network consisting of multiple secondary users (SUs) and a secondary base station (BS) implementing a two-phase protocol. In the first phase, censor-based cooperative spectrum sensing is carried out to detect the PU's presence. When the channel is estimated to be free, SUs transmit data in the uplink to the BS in the second phase by using CDMA. We optimize the sensing parameters and transmit power of SUs jointly to minimize the total energy consumption with the constraints on SUs' quality of service (QoS) and detection probability of the PU. This is a nonconvex problem, which we represent as a monotonic optimization problem and solve by means of monotonic programming. Furthermore, we study the separate optimization problem in which sensing parameters and transmit power are optimized to minimize the energy consumption of the first phase and the second phase disjointly. Numerical results show that the proposed joint optimization method saves energy consumption significantly in lower signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). It can introduce as high as 3.9 and 8.7 dB joule energy saving per time slot in zero-sensing SNR under the same data rate constraints of 0.5 and 1 bit/s/Hz, respectively.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Optimal Spectrum Sensing and Power Allocation in CDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2362936","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7268796/06922593.pdf","startPage":"3990","endPage":"3998","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2362936","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7268796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6922593","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922593/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Joint Optimal Spectrum Sensing and Power Allocation in CDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6922593/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456558","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Optimal Spectrum Sensing and Power Allocation in CDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tvt-janatian-2362936-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.080364S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7268796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"7268796","articleId":"6922593","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6922603,"authors":[{"name":"Ki Yong Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/6966820/6922603/kwon-2352412-small.gif","p":["Ki Yong Kwon (S\u201909) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA, in 2007 and 2010, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering.

The length of the microneedles was controlled by tuning the volume of the SU-8 droplet, utilizing the wetting barrier phenomenon at a liquid-vapor-hydrophilic surface-hydrophobic surface interface. The experimental results show excellent repeatability and controllability of the DBE method for microneedle fabrication. Analytical models and the finite element method were studied to predict the dimensions of the microneedles, which agreed with the experimental data. To verify the versatility of the proposed DBE method, different microneedle structures were implemented, including a slanted hollow microneedle array and a slanted microscale waveguide (\u03bc-waveguide) array.

In this paper, a set of performance criteria and development considerations, required to meet the need of applications of ambient electromagnetic energy harvesting, are also derived from the radiating source analysis. The criteria can be calculated from a simple measurement of the I-V nonlinear behavior of RF rectification devices such as diodes and transistors, as well as linear frequency behavior (S-parameters). The existing rectifying devices are then reviewed in light of the defined performance criteria.

Although, Conventional Doherty amplifier base station can't meet this requirement. For the first time, This is the first use of Envelope tracking (ET) technology is used to dynamically control the gate voltage of Doherty power amplifier peak amplifier: at low power input, low voltage is supplied to the peaking amplifier, aiming to improve efficiency: on the other hand, at high power input, high voltage is supplied to the peaking amplifier to obtain high efficiency. Compared with the traditional power amplifier, the new design could improve the linearity without decreasing efficiency.

In previous works, a model has been developed by bridging characteristics of microscopic domain distribution into the macroscopic behavior. It reproduces longitudinal strain and electrical displacement as a function of uniaxial electrical loading, according to material parameters and applied electrical field. Optimization is performed between theoretical and experimental hysteresis curves. This method is based on a genetic algorithm procedure in order to ensure robust convergence even if the system is multimodal. Materials used in this study are PLZT8/65/35 and PZT-5A. After optimization, experimental curves are well fitted to theoretical curves and a good agreement has been shown between retrieved parameters and values reported in literature. This validates domain wall modeling and genetic algorithm as an efficient way to characterize piezoceramic materials under harsh operating conditions.","doi":"10.1109/ISAF.2014.6922964","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 Joint IEEE International Symposium on the Applications of Ferroelectric, International Workshop on Acoustic Transduction Materials and Devices & Workshop on Piezoresponse Force Microscopy","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISAF.2014.6922964","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6922955","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Joint IEEE International Symposium on the Applications of Ferroelectric, International Workshop on Acoustic Transduction Materials and Devices & Workshop on Piezoresponse Force Microscopy","pdfPath":"/iel7/6905923/6922955/06922964.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determination of microscopic parameters of piezoceramic materials under electrical loading using genetic algorithm","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6922964/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Determination of microscopic parameters of piezoceramic materials under electrical loading using genetic algorithm","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6922964/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14666234","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"12-16 May 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-16 May 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determination of microscopic parameters of piezoceramic materials under electrical loading using genetic algorithm","confLoc":"State College, PA, USA","sourcePdf":"BustilloPID3201699.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067135S","chronDate":"12-16 May 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6905923","isNumber":"6922955","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6905923","xplore-issue":"6922955","articleId":"6922964","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6922970,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Besides several practical advantages, CDMA suffers with multiuser interference, limiting the spectral efficiency drastically. There are various optimal and suboptimal multi user detection techniques in CDMA to overcome this problem. These MUDs identify the desired users signal but the interference signal is high and there is a chance of loosing the signal. By considering these drawbacks, we propose a MUD technique using Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). The main objective of this technique is to detect the desired user signal with less interference ratio. An elliptic curve based key is generated and encoded the user signals before transmission.

To obtain the spatial diversity between the symbols, STBC block codes were used. Space time block coding (STBC) is the most efficient method due to its provision of full spatial diversity and simple linear decoder. The combination of space-time block coding (STBC) and Direct-Sequence CodeDivision Multiple Access (CDMA) has the potential to increase the performance of multiple users in a cellular network. The BER performance of MIMO-CDMA system depends on its spreading strategy. In this paper MIMO-CDMA in calibration with OFDM system is designed with STBC matrices for spreading.

The DTMF tones are chosen such that decoding the pressed key from the received tones is very easier. The DTMF tone detection is very crucial block in several telecom based embedded systems. As the current generation embedded systems are looking for key feature of low power, the DTMF detection algorithm also must be implemented with low power schemes. The DTMF detection is done with FFT based technique but which is power consuming type and it requires more hardware. In this project the FPGA based DTMF detection with very low power and low area using Split Goertzel algorithm is implemented in VHDL. The split Goertzel algorithm itself is an area optimized solution in comparison with the FFT, but in this project we initiate efforts to further makes it low power by building lot of serialism in the design. Since DTMF based applications don't require high speed tone detection the resource sharing approach can be used. In this approach very minimal set of hardware is scheduled as inputs and outputs at appropriate clock edges, for implementing the algorithm. In the first phase of the project we implemented FFT based DTMF detection using Xilinx FFT core. The area, timing and power results is analyzed. In the second phase the split Goertzel algorithm is implemented and analysis is carried out. In the next phase the resource sharing approach is studied and suitable state machine based scheduling will be carried with limited resources to implement split Goertzel algorithm. It will be demonstrated that the novel resource sharing based approach consumes less power and can still efficiently detect the DTMF tones. To test the project at various stage DTMF tone generator module also will be implemented with digital carrier generators. Mentor Graphics Modelsim Xilinx Edition (MXE) and Xilinx ISE is used for simulation and synthesis respectively. The Xilinx Chipscope tool is used to test the FPGA inside results while the logic running on FPGA. The Xilinx Spartan 3e FPGA Family board is used in this project.","doi":"10.1109/WOCN.2014.6923072","publicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Eleventh International Conference on Wireless and Optical Communications Networks (WOCN)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6912065/6923038/06923072.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WOCN.2014.6923072","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923038","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA based efficient DTMF detection using Split Goertzel algorithm with optimized resource sharing approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923072","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923072/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA based efficient DTMF detection using Split Goertzel algorithm with optimized resource sharing approach","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14666573","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923072/","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA based efficient DTMF detection using Split Goertzel algorithm with optimized resource sharing approach","confLoc":"Vijayawada, India","sourcePdf":"s73.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093486S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912065","isNumber":"6923038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912065","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6923038","articleId":"6923072","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923092,"authors":[{"name":"Rohitha Ujjinimatad","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Rohitha","lastName":"Ujjinimatad","id":"38570423600"},{"name":"Siddarama R Patil","affiliation":["the Department of Psychology, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA"],"firstName":"Siddarama R","lastName":"Patil","id":"37061925600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3156-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3155-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"}],"articleNumber":"6923092","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":192},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["AWGN channels","Cognitive radio","Sensors","Rayleigh channels","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["AWGN channels","cognitive radio","Nakagami channels","probability","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal detection","cognitive radio networks","Nakagami-q channels","Nakagami-m channels","AWGN channels","energy detection method","spectrum sensing","wireless communication channels","fading effects","detection probability","additive white Gaussian noise channels","Marcum-Q function","probability distribution function","PDF","fading channels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive Radio","Fading Channels","Spectrum Sensing","Energy Detection"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we consider the problem of spectrum sensing based on energy detection (ED) method in cognitive radio (CR) over wireless communication channels when users experiences fading and non fading effects.

In one approach the overall end-to-end throughput (OEET) improves as the number of cognitive radio relays (CRRs) increases in CRN. In this approach, the OEET increases with the number of CRRs but at the cost of increased transmission power and overheads, so simple and practical approach is proposed for the relay selection from a set of M CRRs then the channel allocation is performed with this selected cognitive radio relay (CRR). This proposed relay selection scheme uses channel conditions of the cooperative links as a metric for selecting the best cognitive radio relay. Simulation results show that the best CRR selected through the proposed approach performs better than the single CRR, in both the cases of with and without channel allocation (CA). Simulation results are compared with channel allocation (CA) scheme presented in [1]. The selected best CRR gives better performance than single CRR when combined with the channel allocation scheme, i.e., first select the best CRR with proposed relay selection approach and then perform channel allocation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923093/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14666597","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923093/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Relay selection with channel allocation for cognitive radio relay channels in CRN","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Relay selection with channel allocation for cognitive radio relay channels in CRN","confLoc":"Vijayawada, India","sourcePdf":"s132.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059024S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912065","isNumber":"6923038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912065","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6923038","articleId":"6923093","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6923094,"authors":[{"name":"Shekhar Saini","affiliation":["Chandigarh University, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Shekhar","lastName":"Saini","id":"37085364269"},{"name":"Amit Gupta","affiliation":["Chandigarh University, Punjab, India"],"firstName":"Amit","lastName":"Gupta","id":"37085356654"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3156-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3155-2","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2151-7703"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1811-3923"}],"articleNumber":"6923094","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":204},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Power lasers","Bit error rate","Q-factor","Optical transmitters","Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Optical signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","light transmission","optical communication","optical modulation","radio networks","satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal modulation format","low power intersatellite optical wireless communication","miniaturized-satellite communication","LP-IsOWC system","bit error rate","BER","q-factor","eye diagram","bit rate 10 Gbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Q-factor","IsOWC","ISL","BER"]}],"abstract":"LP-IsOWC will be the need and future of miniaturized-satellite communication.

In CCRN, cooperative relaying stimulates primary user (PU) to lease more spectrum to secondary users (SUs). This paper proposes a two stage joint power and spectrum allocation scheme for a CCRN. In the proposed scheme, PU leases unused licensed spectrum to multiple SUs using the frequency division multiple access (FDMA) technique. Here, we have considered that the end users (primary and secondary receivers) can move randomly in any direction. In the first stage, a pricing based dynamic spectrum leasing (DSL) has been used for PU to lease its unused frequency band to the SUs to maximize the revenue. Equal power has been allocated to the PU and all SUs in this stage. In the second stage, a relay assisted DSL scheme has been proposed to induce the PU to lease extra bandwidth to satisfy the increased quality of service (QoS) demands of the SUs, on the condition that QoS of the PU is satisfied. In this stage, power has been allocated to maximize the rate gain of PU and all the SUs. Numerical results have been used to verify the validation of the proposed methodology.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923096/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14666569","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923096/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Joint power and spectrum allocation for cooperative cognitive radio network with end user mobility","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint power and spectrum allocation for cooperative cognitive radio network with end user mobility","confLoc":"Vijayawada, India","sourcePdf":"s142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053783S","chronDate":"11-13 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912065","isNumber":"6923038","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912065","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6923038","articleId":"6923096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6923129,"authors":[{"name":"Beilei Sun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Beilei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085370179"},{"name":"Xi Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085344954"},{"name":"Zongwei Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Zongwei","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38486942000"},{"name":"Xuehai Zhou","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, USTC, Hefei, China"],"firstName":"Xuehai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406428200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5482-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5481-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923129","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":106},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Behavior Gaps and Relations between Operating System and Applications on Accessing DRAM","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923129","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Kernel","Benchmark testing","Computers","Computer architecture","Correlation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["autoregressive moving average processes","buffer storage","DRAM chips","Gaussian processes","operating system kernels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["operating system","hardware resources","DRAM access behaviors","access proportion","row-buffer miss ratio","RBM series","ARMA model","DRAM access command scheduling","Gaussian fitting","kernel influences","process life cycle","system-calls"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","RBM","Kernel","User"]}],"abstract":"Detailed analyses of the behaviors of operating system and applications are significant for taking full advantage of the precious hardware resources and improving performance. This paper focus on their DRAM access behaviors based on access proportion and row-buffer miss ratio (RBM). The access proportions of Kernel and User vary greatly in different stages throughout the lifetime of a process. Most of the row-buffer misses are caused by the one having higher access proportion. By analyzing the RBM series through ARMA model, we found that User's DRAM accesses only have short-term influences on its behavior, while the Kernel's influences are relatively deeper. The ARMA model for the RBM series is able to predict the future RBMs, which are profound basis to schedule the DRAM access commands. The results of Gaussian Fitting show that Kernel and User are tightly correlated on accessing DRAM, especially in the steady stage and the end stage of a process's life cycle. Based on this close relation, it is possible to estimate the DRAM access behaviors of the other one according to the one whose behaviors have been known. System-calls that obviously affect the access proportions and RBMs are also revealed in this paper.","doi":"10.1109/ICECCS.2014.27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICECCS.2014.27","publicationTitle":"2014 19th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 19th International Conference on Engineering of Complex Computer Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/6921524/6923102/06923129.pdf","startPage":"146","endPage":"149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923102","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923129/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-7 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Behavior Gaps and Relations between Operating System and Applications on Accessing DRAM","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"4-7 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14685492","htmlLink":"/document/6923129/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Behavior Gaps and Relations between Operating System and Applications on Accessing DRAM","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"5482a146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093384S","chronDate":"4-7 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6921524","isNumber":"6923102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6921524","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6923102","articleId":"6923129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6923157,"authors":[{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Division of Data Storage System, Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085446372"},{"name":"Dan Feng","affiliation":["Division of Data Storage System, Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Feng","id":"37289600400"},{"name":"Lingfang Zeng","affiliation":["Division of Data Storage System, Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Lingfang","lastName":"Zeng","id":"37288108000"},{"name":"Zhan Shi","affiliation":["Division of Data Storage System, Wuhan National Lab for Optoelectronics, Wuhan, China"],"firstName":"Zhan","lastName":"Shi","id":"37309432700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4087-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923157","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"abstract":"This paper is motivated by our three key observations: (1) there exists a degradation of performance as the interleaved accesses of heterogeneous streams, (2) for the slow stream, sequential accesses suffer huge misses in the prefetching cache, (3) in concurrence paradigm, providing fairness and QoS to concurrent streams is very important which always ignored by the traditional prefetching algorithms. Therefore, we present Fema, a caching management algorithm that enforces the fairness and efficiency for concurrent heterogeneous streams. Fema focuses on three key designs: (1) An adaptive framework (Fema Ada) for prefetching. In the Fema Ada, we propose a rate-aware adjustment of prefetching degree and analysis the optimal partition size. (2) A novel replacement scheme (Fema Rep) in which the accessed data will be firstly evicted to improve the performance. (3) A round robin allocation scheme (Fema Rou) to achieve fairness while as least performance degradation as possible. Results show that Fema is able to achieve averages 81.4% performance improvement over the LRU algorithm, 53.5% over the default Linux Kernel prefetching (LKP) algorithm and 19.0% over the recently proposed practical AMP (adaptive multi-stream prefetching) algorithm. Fema achieves average 74.2% fairness improvement (metric in fair speedup) over the LKP algorithm and 56.5% over the AMP algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","pdfPath":"/iel7/6921427/6923143/06923157.pdf","startPage":"43","endPage":"52","publicationTitle":"2014 9th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2014.14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2014.14","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923143","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923157","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fema: A Fairness and Efficiency Caching Management Algorithm in Shared Cache","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Prefetching","Partitioning algorithms","Degradation","Resource management","Algorithm design and analysis","Performance evaluation","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cache storage","Linux","operating system kernels","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fema algorithm","fairness and efficiency caching management algorithm","shared cache","prefetching cache","concurrence paradigm","prefetching algorithm","concurrent heterogeneous streams","Fema Ada framework","rate-aware adjustment","prefetching degree","partition size","replacement scheme","round robin allocation scheme","Linux Kernel prefetching algorithm","LKP algorithm","AMP algorithm","adaptive multistream prefetching algorithm","fairness improvement"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Prefetching","Fairness","Efficiency","Heterogeneous","Shared Cache"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fema: A Fairness and Efficiency Caching Management Algorithm in Shared Cache","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923157/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14685398","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fema: A Fairness and Efficiency Caching Management Algorithm in Shared Cache","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"4087a043.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070516S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6921427","isNumber":"6923143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6921427","xplore-issue":"6923143","articleId":"6923157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6923184,"authors":[{"name":"Qiang Fu","affiliation":["Inspur Group Co.

Experiment results show that, such availability approached task scheduling algorithm has a system performance advantage over the traditional system task scheduling algorithms, it achieves the goal of balancing availability and task response time in heterogeneous fault-tolerant system, thus improve the system availability.","publicationTitle":"2014 9th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","startPage":"275","endPage":"280","doi":"10.1109/NAS.2014.47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NAS.2014.47","pdfPath":"/iel7/6921427/6923143/06923190.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Architecture, and Storage","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923143","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Availability Approached Task Scheduling Algorithm in Heterogeneous Fault-Tolerant System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923190/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 Aug. 2014","conferenceDate":"6-8 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Availability Approached Task Scheduling Algorithm in Heterogeneous Fault-Tolerant System","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14685394","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923190/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Availability Approached Task Scheduling Algorithm in Heterogeneous Fault-Tolerant System","confLoc":"Tianjin, China","sourcePdf":"4087a275.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.068436S","chronDate":"6-8 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6921427","isNumber":"6923143","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6921427","xplore-issue":"6923143","articleId":"6923190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6923259,"authors":[{"name":"Stefano Ferrari","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Lombardia, IT"],"firstName":"Stefano","lastName":"Ferrari","id":"37274542300"},{"name":"Claudio Leani","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Lombardia, IT"],"firstName":"Claudio","lastName":"Leani","id":"37088263993"},{"name":"Vincenzo Piuri","affiliation":["Universita degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Lombardia, IT"],"firstName":"Vincenzo","lastName":"Piuri","id":"37274535900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4988-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923259","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923259","abstract":"In this paper we present a study on the feasibility of the prediction of the solar radiation on a location giving the meteorological measurement in surrounding locations on a mesoscale system scale.

The concept of Line-of-Sight MIMO uses the spatial separation of radio antennas to create different propagation paths between the same locations and thus allows multiple transmissions over the same radio channel. Combining different antenna schemes provides certain flexibility in designing the system in the \u201ccontrolled\u201d environment, which makes LOS MIMO a great method for increasing the achievable link capacity within the same frequency channel. Hence it provides great advantages for the operators and significant spectrum efficiency increase. However, there are still some open regulatory issues that are currently under discussion. Some of the possible implications of the LOS MIMO concept deployment on the regulatory framework (in terms of frequency planning, licensing, fees etc.) have been presented in this paper.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Overview of the regulatory aspects for the deployment line-of-sight MIMO for fixed links","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ELMAR-2014","doi":"10.1109/ELMAR.2014.6923331","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings ELMAR-2014","pdfPath":"/iel7/6915427/6923293/06923331.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR.2014.6923331","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923331","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923331/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Overview of the regulatory aspects for the deployment line-of-sight MIMO for fixed links","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923331/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14684648","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Overview of the regulatory aspects for the deployment line-of-sight MIMO for fixed links","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"038origresearch.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034217S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6915427","isNumber":"6923293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915427","xplore-issue":"6923293","articleId":"6923331","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society Electronics in Marine - ELMAR","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6923334,"authors":[{"name":"J\u00e1n Pastir\u010d\u00e1k","affiliation":["Technical University of Kosice, Slovak Republic"],"firstName":"J\u00e1n","lastName":"Pastir\u010d\u00e1k","id":"37085403972"},{"name":"Juraj Gazda","affiliation":["Technical University of Kosice, Slovak Republic"],"firstName":"Juraj","lastName":"Gazda","id":"37391894100"},{"name":"Du\u0161an Kocur","affiliation":["Technical University of Kosice, Slovak Republic"],"firstName":"Du\u0161an","lastName":"Kocur","id":"38570654900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-953-184-199-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1334-2630"}],"articleNumber":"6923334","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":286},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Dynamic spectrum access","Licenses","Resource management","Real-time systems","Pricing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","radio access networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spectrum trading","dynamic spectrum access networks","radio spectrum","cognitive radio networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Dynamic spectrum access","spectrum trading","cognitive radio"]}],"abstract":"Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is a novel mechanism designed to increase the utilization of the radio spectrum.

Spectrum trading is a mechanism for flexible transfer of spectrum rights, which increases the revenue of a spectrum seller, and in parallel, the overall spectrum utilization as well. It is expected that the economy of the spectrum trading will play important role in the cognitive radio networks and thus, receive a huge attention currently.

Then the LPFT is combined with the L-statistics to collect only the time-frequency points belonging to the desired signal, while the points belonging to overlapping regions and disturbance are deemed inappropriate and omitted from observations. The relationship between the measurement and sparsity domain is established in order to use the compressive sensing concept and to completely recover the desired signal. The theory is proven on examples.","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings ELMAR-2014","pdfPath":"/iel7/6915427/6923293/06923364.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"Proceedings ELMAR-2014","doi":"10.1109/ELMAR.2014.6923364","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ELMAR.2014.6923364","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923364","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compressive sensing based separation of LFM signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time-frequency analysis","Compressed sensing","Vectors","Discrete Fourier transforms","Frequency modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chirp modulation","compressed sensing","Fourier transforms","frequency modulation","polynomials","signal representation","statistical analysis","time-frequency analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressive sensing","LFM signal separation","linear frequency modulated signal","nonstationary disturbance","linear time-frequency representation","local polynomial Fourier transform","LPFT","data local behavior","frequency-chirp rate domain","sparse signal representation","L-statistics","signal recovery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["time-frequency analysis","compressive sensing","L-estimation","signal separation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923364/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Compressive sensing based separation of LFM signals","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923364/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14684607","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compressive sensing based separation of LFM signals","confLoc":"Zadar, Croatia","sourcePdf":"071origresearch.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061226S","chronDate":"10-12 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6915427","isNumber":"6923293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6915427","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6923293","articleId":"6923364","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Croatian Society Electronics in Marine - ELMAR","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6923420,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Yan Tang","affiliation":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Chongqing University, Chongqing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7001732/6923420/tang-2360672-small.gif","p":["\nYuan Yan Tang (F'04) received the B.S. degree in electrical and computer\nengineering from Chongqing University, Chongqing, China, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Beijing\nUniversity of Post and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from Concordia\nUniversity, Montreal, QC, Canada.","He is currently a Chair Professor with the Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Macau, Macau, China.

Since HSI is a 3-D cube datum, 3-D spatial filtering becomes a simple and effective method for extracting the spectral-spatial information. In this paper, we propose a 3-D scattering wavelet transform, which filters the HSI cube data with a cascade of wavelet decompositions, complex modulus, and local weighted averaging. The scattering feature can adequately capture the spectral-spatial information for classification. In the classification step, a support vector machine based on Gaussian kernel is used as a classifier due to its capability to deal with high-dimensional data. Our method is fully evaluated on four classic HSIs, i.e., Indian Pines, Pavia University, Botswana, and Kennedy Space Center. The classification results show that our method achieves as high as 94.46%, 99.30%, 97.57%, and 95.20% accuracies, respectively, when only 5% of the total samples per class is labeled.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2360672","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7001732/06923420.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2360672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001732","startPage":"2467","endPage":"2480","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Three-Dimensional Scattering Wavelet Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Three-Dimensional Scattering Wavelet Transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"14847904","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6923420/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61273244, MYRG205(Y1-L4)-FST11-TYY, MYRG187(Y1-L3)-FST11-TYY, RDG009/FST-TYY and T-100-2012-A3 and 026-2013-A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Three-Dimensional Scattering Wavelet Transform","sourcePdf":"tgrs-yuan-2360672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166806S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7001732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"62","xplore-issue":"7001732","articleId":"6923420","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6923426,"authors":[{"name":"M.

However, it is challenging to determinate pitch in strong noise because the harmonic structure is corrupted. In this paper, we estimate pitch using supervised learning, where the probabilistic pitch states are directly learned from noisy speech data. We investigate two alternative neural networks modeling pitch state distribution given observations. The first one is a feedforward deep neural network (DNN), which is trained on static frame-level acoustic features. The second one is a recurrent deep neural network (RNN) which is trained on sequential frame-level features and capable of learning temporal dynamics. Both DNNs and RNNs produce accurate probabilistic outputs of pitch states, which are then connected into pitch contours by Viterbi decoding. Our systematic evaluation shows that the proposed pitch tracking algorithms are robust to different noise conditions and can even be applied to reverberant speech. The proposed approach also significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art pitch tracking algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","volume":"22","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 October 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14679739","htmlLink":"/document/6923432/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Neural Network Based Pitch Tracking in Very Noisy Speech","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural Network Based Pitch Tracking in Very Noisy Speech","sourcePdf":"taslp-han-2363410-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072512S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"6570655","isNumber":"6882846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"47","xplore-issue":"6882846","articleId":"6923432","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6923439,"authors":[{"name":"Baker S.

The first methodology is based on faulty static random-access memory (SRAM) cells detections and cache resizing. The key advantage of this approach is that it enables the end user to control the system's parameters to be error tolerant. Furthermore, this technique enables aggressive voltage scaling which causes parametric (soft) failures in SRAM-based memory. As such, the proposed methodology can be utilized to exchange cache size for lower power or better yield. In the second methodology, data from faulty cells are treated as imposed noise. Depending on the application, this error percentage (imposed noise) can be mitigated through three options. First, ignore error if the percentage of the error is tolerable. Second, simple hardware filtration is needed. Finally, software-based filtration is required. The viability of this approach is that it allows aggressive voltage scaling below the traditional to be a 100% correct approach for SRAM supply, which results in substantial reduction of power, trading off quality for power. For both approaches, BIST is used as part of the powerup sequence to identify the faulty memory addresses per voltage level and compute the faulty cells percentage. Furthermore, the proposed methodologies help in improving reliability and counteracting long-term effects on memory cell stability and lifetime degradation caused by negative bias temperature instability.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2360319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2360319","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7274516/06923439.pdf","startPage":"2054","endPage":"2064","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923439/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Design Methodologies for Yield Enhancement and Power Efficiency in SRAM-Based SoCs","volume":"23","issue":"10","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15475023","htmlLink":"/document/6923439/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Advanced Technology Investment Company-Semiconductor Research Corporation, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, through the Project entitled A Low-Power System-on-Chip Detector and Descriptor of Visual Key Points for Video Surveillance Applications","grantNumber":"2013-HJ-2440"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design Methodologies for Yield Enhancement and Power Efficiency in SRAM-Based SoCs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-mohammad-2360319-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068874S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7274516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7274516","articleId":"6923439","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6923440,"authors":[{"name":"Nick C.

By exploiting the complementary information captured by the cameras, we can transfer knowledge between the cameras to address the difficulties of people counting and improve the performance. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, normalizing the perspective of visual features and estimating the size of a crowd are highly correlated tasks. Hence, we treat them as a joint learning problem. The derived counting model is scalable and it provides more accurate results than existing approaches. Second, we introduce an algorithm that matches groups of pedestrians in images captured by different cameras. The results provide a common domain for knowledge transfer, so we can work with multiple cameras without worrying about their differences. Third, the proposed counting system is comprised of a pair of collaborative regressors. The first one determines the people count based on features extracted from intracamera visual information, whereas the second calculates the residual by considering the conflicts between intercamera predictions. The two regressors are elegantly coupled and provide an accurate people counting system. The results of experiments in various settings show that, overall, our approach outperforms comparable baseline methods. The significant performance improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of our two-pass regression framework.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923440/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","volume":"24","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"14807118","pubMedId":"25330489","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923440/","dateOfInsertion":"05 December 2014","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Camera Knowledge Transfer for Multiview People Counting","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003711","fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"103-2221-E-001-026-MY2"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Camera Knowledge Transfer for Multiview People Counting","sourcePdf":"tip-lin-2363445-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107498S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6978084","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6978084","articleId":"6923440","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6923441,"authors":[{"name":"Adrian I.

Traditional static noise margin metrics fail to capture the dynamic characteristics of SRAM behavior, leading to expensive over design and disastrous under design. One of the central components of more accurate dynamic stability analysis is the separatrix; however, its straightforward extraction is extremely time-consuming, and efficient methods are either nonaccurate or extremely difficult to implement. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for fast separatrix tracing of any given SRAM topology, designed with industry standard transistor models in nanoscaled technologies. The proposed algorithm is applied to both standard 6T SRAM bitcells, as well as previously proposed alternative subthreshold bitcells, providing up to three orders-of-magnitude speedup, as compared with brute force methods. In addition, for the first time, statistical Monte Carlo separatrix distributions are plotted.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7274516","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/92/7274516/06923443.pdf","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2358699","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2014.2358699","startPage":"2034","endPage":"2042","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast Modular Method for True Variation-Aware Separatrix Tracing in Nanoscaled SRAMs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923443/","displayDocTitle":"A Fast Modular Method for True Variation-Aware Separatrix Tracing in Nanoscaled SRAMs","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923443/","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"23","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"15475040","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2015","publicationDate":"Oct. 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast Modular Method for True Variation-Aware Separatrix Tracing in Nanoscaled SRAMs","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-teman-2358699-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066691S","chronDate":"Oct.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"7274516","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"7274516","articleId":"6923443","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6923451,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew J.

Variable splitting algorithms are the current state-of-the-art algorithms for SENSE-type MR image reconstruction with sparsity-promoting regularization. These methods are very general and have been observed to work with almost any regularizer; however, the tuning of associated convergence parameters is a commonly-cited hindrance in their adoption. Conversely, majorize-minimize algorithms based on a single Lipschitz constant have been observed to be slow in shift-variant applications such as SENSE-type MR image reconstruction since the associated Lipschitz constants are loose bounds for the shift-variant behavior. This paper bridges the gap between the Lipschitz constant and the shift-variant aspects of SENSE-type MR imaging by introducing majorizing matrices in the range of the regularizer matrix. The proposed majorize-minimize methods (called BARISTA) converge faster than state-of-the-art variable splitting algorithms when combined with momentum acceleration and adaptive momentum restarting. Furthermore, the tuning parameters associated with the proposed methods are unitless convergence tolerances that are easier to choose than the constraint penalty parameters required by variable splitting algorithms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923451/","volume":"34","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6923451/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14883771","pubMedId":"25330484","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"30 January 2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fast Parallel MR Image Reconstruction via B1-Based, Adaptive Restart, Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithms (BARISTA)","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Parallel MR Image Reconstruction via B1-Based, Adaptive Restart, Iterative Soft Thresholding Algorithms (BARISTA)","sourcePdf":"tmi-muckley-2363034-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094979S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"7027910","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"7027910","articleId":"6923451","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6923466,"authors":[{"name":"Yan Luo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6990683/6923466/luo-2363396-small.gif","p":["Yan Luo (S\u201913) received the bachelor\u2019s degree from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2010, and the master\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees from Duke University in North Carolina, Durham, NC, USA, in 2012 and 2013, respectively.","She is currently a Research Scientist with Sumo Logic, Inc., Redwood City, CA, USA.

To amplify the traces of DNA strands, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is widely used for conducting subsequent experiments. Compared to conventional instruments and analyzers, the execution of PCR on a digital microfluidic biochip (DMFB) can achieve short time-to-results, low reagent consumption, rapid heating/cooling rates, and high integration of multiple processing modules. However, the PCR biochip design methods in the literature are oblivious to the inherent randomness and complexity of bioanalyses, and they do not consider the interference among the neighboring devices and the cost of droplet transportation. We present an integrated design solution to optimize the complete PCR procedure, including: 1) DNA amplification and termination control; 2) resource placement that satisfies proximity constraints; and 3) droplet transportation. Based on the sensor feedback data, a statistical model is developed to optimize and control the DNA amplification sequence in real-time on a cyberphysical biochip. Next, we present a geometric algorithm for avoiding device interference and for reducing droplet routing cost. A novel optical sensing system is deployed based on the physical visibility of droplets. Simulation results for three laboratory protocols demonstrate that the proposed design method results in a compact layout and produces an execution sequence for efficient control of PCR operations on a cyberphysical DMFB.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923466/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923466/","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14811169","volume":"34","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design and Optimization of a Cyberphysical Digital-Microfluidic Biochip for the Polymerase Chain Reaction","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Nanotechnology Research Triangle provided by the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India"},{"fundingName":"Taiwan Ministry of Science and Technology","grantNumber":"MOST 102-2221-E-009-194-MY3, 103-2220-E-009-029 and 103-2923-E-009-006-MY3"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1135853"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Optimization of a Cyberphysical Digital-Microfluidic Biochip for the Polymerase Chain Reaction","sourcePdf":"tcad-luo-2363396-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.101934S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6990683","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"6990683","articleId":"6923466","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923473,"authors":[{"name":"Zbigniew Hajduk","affiliation":["Department of Computer and Control Engineering, Rzeszow University of Technology, Rzeszow, Poland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7080969/6923473/hajdu-2362888-small.gif","p":["\nZbigniew Hajduk (M'13) received Ph.D. degree (with honors) in computer \nengineering from the University of Zielona G\u00f3ra, Zielona G\u00f3ra, Poland, in 2006.","He is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer and Control Engineering, Rzesz\u00f3w University of \nTechnology, Rzesz\u00f3w, Poland.

The proposed AGB technique and near-threshold voltage (near- VTH) energy redistribution control (ERC) ensure high conversion efficiency over a wide range of load currents. The proposed method automatically reduces conduction and switching losses of power MOSFETs without the need for auxiliary power converters or additional off-chip inductors.

We consider ad hoc wireless networks with general conflict graph-based interference model and single-hop traffic. Each packet is associated with a deadline and will be dropped if it is not transmitted before the deadline. The number of packet arrivals in each time-slot and the maximum delay before the deadline are independent and identically distributed across time. We require a minimum fraction of packets to be delivered. At each link, we assume the link keeps track of the difference between the minimum number of packets that need to be delivered so far and the number of packets that are actually delivered, which we call the deficit. The largest-deficit-first (LDF) policy schedules links in descending order according to their deficit values, which is a variation of the longest-queue-first (LQF) policy for non-real-time traffic. We prove that the efficiency ratio of LDF, which is the fraction of the throughput region that LDF can achieve for given traffic distributions, can be lower-bounded by a quantity that we call the real-time local-pooling factor (R-LPF). We further prove that a lower bound on the R-LPF can be related to the weighted sum of the service rates, with a special case of 1/(\u03b2+1) by considering the uniform weight, where \u03b2 is the interference degree of the conflict graph. We also propose a heuristic consensus algorithm that can be used to obtain a good weight vector for such lower bounds for given network topology.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2014.2360365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7398272","startPage":"72","endPage":"84","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel7/90/7398272/06923479.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Performance of Largest-Deficit-First for Scheduling Real-Time Traffic in Wireless Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2016","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6923479/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"On the Performance of Largest-Deficit-First for Scheduling Real-Time Traffic in Wireless Networks","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Feb. 2016","accessionNumber":"15786352","dateOfInsertion":"12 February 2016","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"24","issue":"1","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation NSF","grantNumber":"CNS-1261429, CNS-1264012 and CNS-1262329"},{"fundingName":"Defense Threat Reduction Agency DTRA","grantNumber":"HDTRA1-13-1-0030"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Performance of Largest-Deficit-First for Scheduling Real-Time Traffic in Wireless Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-kang-2360365-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09512S","chronDate":"Feb.  2016","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"7398272","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"7398272","articleId":"6923479","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6923480,"authors":[{"name":"Yongjia Li","affiliation":["Section Bioelectronics, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6949172/6923480/6923480-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yongjia Li (S'11) was born in Sichuan Province, China.

Owing to an area and power efficient implementation, we were able to integrate 1024 readout channels on chip to record extracellular signals from a user-specified selection of electrodes. These channels feature noise values of 2.4 \u03bcV in the action-potential band (300 Hz-10 kHz) and 5.4 \u03bcV in the local-field-potential band (1 Hz-300 Hz), and provide programmable gain (up to 78 dB) to accommodate various biological preparations. Amplified and filtered signals are digitized by 10 bit parallel single-slope ADCs at 20 kSamples/s. The system also includes 32 stimulation units, which can elicit neural spikes through either current or voltage pulses. The chip consumes only 75 mW in total, which obviates the need of active cooling even for sensitive cell cultures.","doi":"10.1109/JSSC.2014.2359219","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSSC.2014.2359219","startPage":"2705","endPage":"2719","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits","pdfPath":"/iel7/4/6936396/06923484.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6936396","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 1024-Channel CMOS Microelectrode Array With 26,400 Electrodes for Recording and Stimulation of Electrogenic Cells In Vitro","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"A 1024-Channel CMOS Microelectrode Array With 26,400 Electrodes for Recording and Stimulation of Electrogenic Cells In Vitro","volume":"49","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14695941","pubMedId":"28502989","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6923484/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1024-Channel CMOS Microelectrode Array With 26,400 Electrodes for Recording and Stimulation of Electrogenic Cells In Vitro","sourcePdf":"jssc-ballini-2359219-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.17507S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4","isNumber":"6936396","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4","citationCount":"121","xplore-issue":"6936396","articleId":"6923484","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6923488,"authors":[{"name":"Feiyun Zhu","affiliation":["National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/6924847/6923488/zhu-2363423-small.gif","p":["Feiyun Zhu received the B.S. degree from the Image Processing Center, School of Astronautics, Beihang University, Beijing, China, in 2010.

From an unsupervised learning perspective, this problem is very challenging-both the spectral bases and their composite percentages are unknown, making the solution space too large. To reduce the solution space, many approaches have been proposed by exploiting various priors. In practice, these priors would easily lead to some unsuitable solution. This is because they are achieved by applying an identical strength of constraints to all the factors, which does not hold in practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel sparsity-based method by learning a data-guided map (DgMap) to describe the individual mixed level of each pixel. Through this DgMap, the \u2113\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">p</sub>\n (0 <; p <; 1) constraint is applied in an adaptive manner. Such implementation not only meets the practical situation, but also guides the spectral bases toward the pixels under highly sparse constraint. What is more, an elegant optimization scheme as well as its convergence proof have been provided in this paper. Extensive experiments on several datasets also demonstrate that the DgMap is feasible, and high quality unmixing results could be obtained by our method.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2014.2363423","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/83/6924847/06923488.pdf","startPage":"5412","endPage":"5427","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2014.2363423","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924847","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spectral Unmixing via Data-Guided Sparsity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923488/","displayDocTitle":"Spectral Unmixing via Data-Guided Sparsity","volume":"23","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14754017","pubMedId":"25330488","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923488/","dateOfInsertion":"12 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61331018, 91338202, 61305049 and 61375024"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spectral Unmixing via Data-Guided Sparsity","sourcePdf":"tip-zhu-2363423-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108667S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"6924847","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6924847","articleId":"6923488","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6923490,"authors":[{"name":"Yonghong Tao","affiliation":["D-BSSE, Bio Engineering Laboratory, Basel, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7022009/6923490/6923490-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yonghong Tao (M'2010) received the B.S. degree in 2001 from Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, China, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from National University of Singapore in 2006 in 2012, respectively.","From 2002 to 2006, he worked with Future Techno Designs and Creative Technology, Singapore, as a Digital IC Design Engineer.

We focus on parallel-jaw push grasping for the class of parts that can be modeled as extruded 2-D polygons with statistical tolerancing. We describe an extension to model part slip and experimental results with an adaptive sampling algorithm that can reduce sample size by 90%.

Most of the existing algorithms for approximation of the DCT target only the DCT of small transform lengths, and some of them are non-orthogonal. This paper presents a generalized recursive algorithm to obtain orthogonal approximation of DCT where an approximate DCT of length N could be derived from a pair of DCTs of length (N/2) at the cost of N additions for input preprocessing. We perform recursive sparse matrix decomposition and make use of the symmetries of DCT basis vectors for deriving the proposed approximation algorithm. Proposed algorithm is highly scalable for hardware as well as software implementation of DCT of higher lengths, and it can make use of the existing approximation of 8-point DCT to obtain approximate DCT of any power of two length, N > 8. We demonstrate that the proposed approximation of DCT provides comparable or better image and video compression performance than the existing approximation methods. It is shown that proposed algorithm involves lower arithmetic complexity compared with the other existing approximation algorithms. We have presented a fully scalable reconfigurable parallel architecture for the computation of approximate DCT based on the proposed algorithm. One uniquely interesting feature of the proposed design is that it could be configured for the computation of a 32-point DCT or for parallel computation of two 16-point DCTs or four 8-point DCTs with a marginal control overhead. The proposed architecture is found to offer many advantages in terms of hardware complexity, regularity and modularity. Experimental results obtained from FPGA implementation show the advantage of the proposed method.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2360763","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7022009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2360763","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7022009/06923492.pdf","startPage":"449","endPage":"457","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Generalized Algorithm and Reconfigurable Architecture for Efficient and Scalable Orthogonal Approximation of DCT","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Generalized Algorithm and Reconfigurable Architecture for Efficient and Scalable Orthogonal Approximation of DCT","volume":"62","issue":"2","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","dateOfInsertion":"26 January 2015","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923492/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14883380","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923492/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Generalized Algorithm and Reconfigurable Architecture for Efficient and Scalable Orthogonal Approximation of DCT","sourcePdf":"tcsi-jridi-2360763-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.151237S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7022009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7022009","articleId":"6923492","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6923493,"authors":[{"name":"Xin-Ru Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7022009/6923493/6923493-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xin-Ru Lee received the B.S. degree in power mechanical engineering from National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2007 and the M.S. degree from the Institute of Electronics Engineering, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, in 2009.

The critical path is improved by a reconfigurable stochastic check node unit (CNU) and variable node unit (VNU); therefore, a high throughput scheme can be realized with 768 MHz clock frequency. To achieve higher hardware and energy efficiency, the reduced complexity architecture of tracking forecast memory is experimentally investigated to implement the variable node units for IEEE 802.15.3c applications. Based on the properties of parity check matrices and stochastic arithmetic, the optimized routing networks with re-permutation techniques are adopted to enhance chip utilization. Considering the measurement uncertainties, a delay-lock loop with isolated power domain and a test environment consisting of an encoder, an AWGN generator and bypass circuits are also designed for inner clock and information generation.

Moreover, their center frequency is flexibly programmable by a digital clock. Unfortunately, the time variant nature of these circuits also results in unwanted signal folding. This paper proves analytically that folding can be reduced and band pass filtering can be improved by adding an inductance in series with the switched-R-C network. In contrast, a shunt capacitor degrades band-pass filter performance. The interaction between the reactive series impedance and the switched capacitors of an N-path filter complicates analysis due to memory effects associated with reactive components. Assuming N identical signal paths with 1/ N duty cycle, we show it is possible to solve the set of differential equations, by assuming that the signals in each path only differ in delay. Analytical equations are verified versus simulations, and the benefits in filter properties and reduction in signal folding are demonstrated.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2015","volume":"62","issue":"1","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14870065","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Jan. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6923495/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the Signal Transfer and Folding in N-Path Filters With a Series Inductance","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the Signal Transfer and Folding in N-Path Filters With a Series Inductance","sourcePdf":"tcsi-klumperink-2354772-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.116448S","chronDate":"Jan.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7001724","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"7001724","articleId":"6923495","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6923497,"authors":[{"name":"Shahaboddin Moazzeni","affiliation":["Dept. of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Concordia University and Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7022009/6923497/6923497-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shahaboddin Moazzeni received his B.Sc. and M.S. degree in Electrical Engi neering from University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, and Concordia University, Montreal, QC, Canada in 2007 and 2009, respectively.

During the Monitoring (MO) mode, the start frame bits are received at a data rate of 10 kbps, while during the Identifier (ID) mode the remaining wake-up pattern is transmitted at 200 kbps. By lowering the gain of the front-end amplifier in the MO mode the power dissipation is reduced, which in turn causes an increase in the overall noise figure of the receiver. However, adequate sensitivity is maintained by intentionally lowering the data rate as well as the detection bandwidth of the receiver. The proposed wake-up receiver is designed and fabricated in IBM 130 nm technology with a core size of about 0.2 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n for the target frequency range of 902-928 MHz. The measured results show that the proposed dual-mode receiver achieves a sensitivity of -78.5 dBm and -75 dBm while dissipating an average power of 16.4 \u03bcW and 22.9 \u03bcW during MO and ID modes, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2360336","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2360336","startPage":"517","endPage":"526","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7022009/06923497.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7022009","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Ultra-Low-Power Energy-Efficient Dual-Mode Wake-Up Receiver","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"An Ultra-Low-Power Energy-Efficient Dual-Mode Wake-Up Receiver","volume":"62","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","accessionNumber":"14883396","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6923497/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Ultra-Low-Power Energy-Efficient Dual-Mode Wake-Up Receiver","sourcePdf":"tcsi-moazzeni-2360336-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075573S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7022009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"7022009","articleId":"6923497","onlineDate":"14 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6923498,"authors":[{"name":"Dong Uk Lee","affiliation":["SKHynix, Icheon-si, Gyeonggi-do, KOREA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/6998099/6923498/6923498-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Dong Uk Lee (M'07) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Hanyang University, Seoul, Korea, 1996 and 2001, respectively.","He joined Hyundai Electronics (now SK Hynix), Icheon, Korea, in 2001.

This unprecedented growth demands a significant increase of wireless network capacity. Even if the current evolution of fourth-generation (4G) systems and, in particular, the advancements of the long-term evolution (LTE) standardization process foresees a significant capacity improvement with respect to third-generation (3G) systems, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has established a roadmap toward the fifth-generation (5G) system, with the aim of deploying a commercial system by the year 2020 [1]. The European Project named ?Mobile and Wireless Communications Enablers for the 2020 Information Society? (METIS), launched in 2012, represents one of the first international and large-scale research projects on fifth generation (5G) [2]. In parallel with this unparalleled growth of data traffic, our everyday life experience shows an increasing habit to run a plethora of applications specifically devised for mobile devices, (smartphones, tablets, laptops)for entertainment, health care, business, social networking, traveling, news, etc. However, the spectacular growth in wireless traffic generated by this lifestyle is not matched with a parallel improvement on mobile handsets? batteries, whose lifetime is not improving at the same pace [3]. This determines a widening gap between the energy required to run sophisticated applications and the energy available on the mobile handset. A possible way to overcome this obstacle is to enable the mobile devices, whenever possible and convenient, to offload their most energy-consuming tasks to nearby fixed servers. This strategy has been studied for a long time and is reported in the literature under different names, such as cyberforaging [4] or computation offloading [5], [6]. In recent years, a strong impulse to computation offloading has come through cloud computing (CC), which enables the users to utilize resources on demand. The resources made available by a cloud service provider are: 1) infrastructures, such as network devices, storage, servers, etc., 2) platforms, such as operating systems, offering an integrated environment for developing and testing custom applications, and 3) software, in the form of application programs. These three kinds of services are labeled, respectively, as infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service. In particular, one of the key features of CC is virtualization, which makes it possible to run multiple operating systems and multiple applications over the same machine (or set of machines), while guaranteeing isolation and protection of the programs and their data. Through virtualization, the number of virtual machines (VMs) can scale on ?demand, thus improving the overall system computational efficiency. Mobile CC (MCC) is a specific case of CC where the user accesses the cloud services through a mobile handset [5]. The major limitations of today?s MCC are the energy consumption associated to the radio access and the latency experienced in reaching the cloud provider through a wide area network (WAN). Mobile users located at the edge of macrocellular networks are particularly disadvantaged in terms of power consumption and, furthermore, it is very difficult to control latency over a WAN. As pointed out in [7]?[9], humans are acutely sensitive to delay and jitter: as latency increases, interactive response suffers. Since the interaction times foreseen in 5G systems, in particular in the so-called tactile Internet [10], are quite small (in the order of milliseconds), a strict latency control must be somehow incorporated in near future MCC. Meeting this constraint requires a deep ?rethinking of the overall service chain, from the physical layer up to virtualization.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2014.2334709","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/6923515/06923537.pdf","startPage":"45","endPage":"55","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2014.2334709","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communicating While Computing: Distributed mobile cloud computing over 5G heterogeneous networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923537","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Communicating While Computing: Distributed mobile cloud computing over 5G heterogeneous networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923537/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14665315","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923537/","volume":"31","issue":"6","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communicating While Computing: Distributed mobile cloud computing over 5G heterogeneous networks","sourcePdf":"31msp06-barbarossa-2334709-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.106266S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6923515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"287","xplore-issue":"6923515","articleId":"6923537","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6923542,"authors":[{"name":"Hadi Baligh","affiliation":["Huawei Canada, Ottawa"],"bio":{"p":["Hadi Baligh (hadi.baligh@huawei.com) received his B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Iran, in 1996, and his M.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 1999.

To this end, virtualized and mass-scale cloud architectures are proposed as promising technologies for 5G in which all the nodes are connected via a backhaul network and managed centrally by such cloud centers. The significant computing power made available by the cloud technologies has enabled the implementation of sophisticated signal processing algorithms, especially by way of parallel processing, for both interference management and network provision. The latter two are among the major signal processing tasks for 5G due to an increased level of frequency sharing, node density, interference, and network congestion. This article outlines several theoretical and practical aspects of joint interference management and network provisioning for future 5G networks. A cross-layer optimization framework is proposed for joint user admission, user-base station (BS) association, power control, user grouping, transceiver design, as well as routing and flow control. We show that many of these cross-layer tasks can be treated in a unified way and implemented in a parallel manner using an efficient algorithmic framework called weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE). Some recent developments in this area are highlighted and future research directions are identified.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/6923515/06923542.pdf","startPage":"56","endPage":"68","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2014.2335237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2014.2335237","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923542","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Provision of Future Cellular Networks: A WMMSE-based approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Algorithm design and analysis","Signal processing algorithms","5G mobile communication","Optimization","Wireless communication","MIMO","Wireless cellular networks","Cellular networks","Next generation networking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","cloud computing","interference (signal)","least mean squares methods","power control","radio transceivers","signal processing","telecommunication congestion control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cross-layer provision","cellular networks","WMMSE-based approach","wireless data","service coverage","fifth-generation networks","5G networks","low-power nodes","virtualized cloud architectures","mass-scale cloud architectures","backhaul network","cloud centers","cloud technologies","signal processing algorithms","parallel processing","frequency sharing","node density","network congestion","joint interference management","network provisioning","cross-layer optimization framework","joint user admission","user-base station association","power control","user grouping","transceiver design","flow control","weighted minimum mean squared error"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923542/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"14 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Provision of Future Cellular Networks: A WMMSE-based approach","volume":"31","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6923542/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665306","dateOfInsertion":"14 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Provision of Future Cellular Networks: A WMMSE-based approach","sourcePdf":"31msp06-baligh-2335237-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090185S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6923515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6923515","articleId":"6923542","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6923667,"authors":[{"name":"Yao Zhang","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085736065"},{"name":"Yuxin Zhao","affiliation":["College of Automation, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Yuxin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37713954300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5372-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5371-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923667","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":718},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vehicles","Neural networks","Shafts","Attitude control","Sliding mode control","Interference"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system synthesis","motion control","neurocontrollers","radial basis function networks","robust control","space vehicles","tracking","variable structure systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control input saturation sliding-mode control system design","spacecraft based on neural network","spacecraft tracking system","input control","spacecraft single shaft motion","system stability","control input error","RBF neural network","robustness","estimation error","dynamic performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control input saturation","Sliding Mode Control","Neural Network","Spacecraft Single Shaft Motion"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923667","abstract":"For spacecraft tracking system, the input control is saturated because of the actuators constrains.

The new approach that we add the nearest neighbor idea and the triangular area sampling idea to the SMOTE performed better in dealing with samples of minority class by turning imbalanced problems into balanced ones. Thus, performance of single classifiers in predicting risk on imbalanced and small datasets was improved. By using the related knowledge of data excavation principles, the data of listed companies of the Chinese tourism and hospitality industry were processed. Missing samples and missing financial indicators were eliminated. Significant indicators of financial data were filtered out with significance test. Then, NT-SMOTE was used to over-sample minority samples. Further, we used a variety of popular single classifiers of financial risk prediction, including: MDA, DT, LSVM, Logit, and Probit, for risk prediction. These single classifiers improved with NT-SMOTE can reasonably and effectively solve the problem of imbalanced and small sample oriented firm risk prediction.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923741/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-6 July 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-6 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6923741/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14685653","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Neighborhood Triangular Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Imbalanced Prediction on Small Samples of Chinese Tourism and Hospitality Firms","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neighborhood Triangular Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Imbalanced Prediction on Small Samples of Chinese Tourism and Hospitality Firms","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"5372a534.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065071S","chronDate":"4-6 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6921704","isNumber":"6923615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6921704","xplore-issue":"6923615","articleId":"6923741","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6923793,"authors":[{"name":"E.

Two spreading sequences are investigated in this study, namely, Walsh-Hadamard and polyphase codes. The impact of different loading scenarios, ranging from light-to full-loading, on the probability of blanking error and output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance is examined. In addition, the optimal blanking threshold that maximizes the system performance is considered for various system loadings and under different IN conditions. Results reveal that the proposed technique is able to provide remarkable output SNR improvement relative to the conventional DS-CDMA system. It is also shown that this enhancement becomes more significant when the number of active users is reduced.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923797.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"55","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923797","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923797","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the performance of multi-user DS-CDMA systems over power-line channels","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Blanking","Multiaccess communication","Loading","Peak to average power ratio","Receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","code division multiple access","Hadamard codes","impulse noise","multiuser channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-spread code-division multiple access","multiuser DS-CDMA systems","powerline channels","impulsive noise","spreading sequences","Walsh-Hadamard codes","polyphase codes","blanking error","optimal blanking threshold"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Blanking","impulsive noise","direct-sequence codedivision multiple access (DS-CDMA)","Walsh-Hadamard (WH) codes","peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)","poly-phase codes","power-line communications (PLC)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"On the performance of multi-user DS-CDMA systems over power-line channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923797/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684167","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the performance of multi-user DS-CDMA systems over power-line channels","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p52rabie.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074203S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923800,"authors":[{"name":"Bamidele Adebisi","affiliation":["School of Engineering, Manchester Metropolitan University, Manchester"],"firstName":"Bamidele","lastName":"Adebisi","id":"37540810700"},{"name":"Abbas Khalid","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology, Abbottabad, Pakistan"],"firstName":"Abbas","lastName":"Khalid","id":"37085484294"},{"name":"Yakubu Tsado","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster"],"firstName":"Yakubu","lastName":"Tsado","id":"37077840900"},{"name":"Bahram Honary","affiliation":["School of Computing and Communications, Lancaster University, Lancaster"],"firstName":"Bahram","lastName":"Honary","id":"37271939000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923800","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":284},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power cables","Attenuation","Transfer functions","Communication systems","Smart grids","Surfaces","Reflection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["carrier transmission on power lines","power utilisation","programmable controllers","smart power grids"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["narrowband PLC channel modelling","smart grid applications","channel characteristics","medium voltage","MV","electrical distribution networks","EDN","power utilities","distribution line carrier","DLC"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MV","PLC","DLC","Channel Model"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents analysis of the channel characteristics of a Medium Voltage (MV) Electrical Distribution Networks (EDN) based on predefined reference scenarios provided by the Power Utilities.

Thanks to the Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek, and Raviv (BCJR) algorithm, the TCM decoder within the proposed design can provide soft decisions which make it possible to use the more powerful LDPC codes. Moreover, the error-correction performance is further improved since TCM can decrease the raw error rate of MLC and hence relieve the burden of outer LDPC code.

Many routing protocols for sensor network have been proposed, some of them tried to cope with the ad-hoc nature while some others focus on improving the energy efficiency. We propose an Energy Harvesting Aware Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol (AODV-EHA) that not only inherits the advantage of existing AODV in dealing with WSN's ad hoc nature, but also make use of the energy harvesting capability of the sensor nodes in the network, which is very meaningful to the data transmission in the environmental and military applications under consideration. Simulations results show the proposed routing protocol has advantages over competing routing protocols in terms of energy cost for data packet delivery.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing protocols","Wireless sensor networks","Routing","Energy harvesting","Ad hoc networks","Network topology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ad hoc networks","data communication","energy conservation","energy harvesting","routing protocols","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless sensor networks","energy efficiency improvement","energy harvesting aware ad hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol","AODV-EHA","WSN ad hoc nature","sensor nodes","data transmission","environmental applications","military applications","energy cost","data packet delivery"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["multi-hops routing","energy efficient routing","energy harvesting aware routing","ad hoc on-demand vector","wireless sensor network"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923819","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923819.pdf","startPage":"171","endPage":"176","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy Harvesting Aware routing protocol for wireless sensor networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923819","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Energy Harvesting Aware routing protocol for wireless sensor networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923819/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923819/","accessionNumber":"14684186","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Harvesting Aware routing protocol for wireless sensor networks","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p171gong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063843S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923819","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6923821,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulkadir Hamidu Alkali","affiliation":["Faculty of Arts, Computing, Engineering and Sciences, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Abdulkadir Hamidu","lastName":"Alkali","id":"37085354332"},{"name":"Reza Saatchi","affiliation":["Faculty of Arts, Computing, Engineering and Sciences, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Reza","lastName":"Saatchi","id":"37297474900"},{"name":"Heather Elphick","affiliation":["Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Heather","lastName":"Elphick","id":"38192998400"},{"name":"Derek Burke","affiliation":["Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Derek","lastName":"Burke","id":"38336337500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923821","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":280},"abstract":"Respiration rate is a critical sign of a person's wellbeing.

The DFrFT descriptors of training images are employed for constructing a dictionary. However, it is required to determine the optimal rotational angles. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem such that the Fisher discriminant is minimized. Nevertheless, this optimization problem is nonconvex. Also, both the intraclass and interclass separations of the DFrFT descriptors are independent of the rotational angles if these separations are defined using the 2-norm operator. To tackle these difficulties, the 1-norm operator is employed instead. However, this reformulated optimization problem is nonsmooth. To solve this problem, the nondifferentiable points of the objective function are found. Then, the stationary points between any two consecutive nondifferentiable points are identified. After that, the objective functional values are evaluated at these nondifferentiable points and stationary points. The smallest L objective functional values are picked up and the corresponding rotational angles are chosen for constructing the dictionary. Here, L is the total number of the rotational angles for constructing the dictionary. Finally, a 1-NN classification rule is applied for performing the image retrieval. Computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method outperforms the conventional DFT descriptor approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923828.pdf","startPage":"217","endPage":"221","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923828","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923828","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923828","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal discrete fractional fourier transform descriptors for image retrieval","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image retrieval","Image edge detection","Discrete Fourier transforms","Optimization","Training","Vectors","Dictionaries"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete Fourier transforms","edge detection","image classification","image representation","image retrieval","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optimal discrete fractional Fourier transform descriptors","image retrieval","DFrFT","edge representation","training images","optimal rotational angles","Fisher discriminant","2-norm operator","reformulated optimization problem","objective functional values","rotational angles","1-NN classification rule"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923828/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Optimal discrete fractional fourier transform descriptors for image retrieval","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923828/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684177","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal discrete fractional fourier transform descriptors for image retrieval","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p217ou.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.104071S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923828","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6923830,"authors":[{"name":"Jerzy Martyna","affiliation":["Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland"],"firstName":"Jerzy","lastName":"Martyna","id":"38475685300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923830","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Oligopoly","Cognitive radio","Pricing","Bandwidth","Games","Numerical models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","game theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["oligopoly Bertrand model","price competition","cognitive radio networks","pricing framework","bandwidth allocation","underlay spectrum sharing","Bertrand theoretic model","noncooperative game theory","spectrum buying","Bertrand model oligopoly"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cognitive radio","spectrum sharing","pricing scheme","oligopoly Bertrand model"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a bandwidth allocation and pricing framework for the spectrum underlay in cognitive radio networks. We assume that a cognitive radio network containing a set of primary users coexists with secondary users in an underlay spectrum sharing paradigm. Primary users use licensed bands of the spectrum while secondary users choose among the bands available on sale based on their prices. By using a oligopoly, primary users in Bertrand's theoretic model participate in a non-cooperative game with secondary users in spectrum buying. As a result, the Bertrand model's oligopoly provides the equilibrium that is the best response correspondence between the primary users. In this type of game, primary users can maximise their own utility function, while secondary users can select resources that hold their minimum payment for buying bandwidth. The simulation results show that the proposed model can be used to solve the spectrum-buying problem for secondary users in cognitive radio networks.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923830","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923830.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923830","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","startPage":"227","endPage":"231","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Oligopoly Bertrand model for price competition in cognitive radio networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923830","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Oligopoly Bertrand model for price competition in cognitive radio networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923830/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923830/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684105","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Oligopoly Bertrand model for price competition in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p227martyna.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076965S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923830","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6923838,"authors":[{"name":"Bolun Cai","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Bolun","lastName":"Cai","id":"37085364820"},{"name":"Xiangmin Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xiangmin","lastName":"Xu","id":"37653884500"},{"name":"Chunmei Qing","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chunmei","lastName":"Qing","id":"37085366169"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923838","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":154},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Visualization","Biological system modeling","Databases","Computational modeling","Detectors","Brain modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image motion analysis","image recognition","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual visual pathways","human action recognition","bio-inspired model based spatio-temporal interesting points","BIM-STIP framework","biological theory","interest points detection","spatio-temporal descriptor construction","dual pathway joint model","dorsal stream","ventral stream","video HAR"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Bio-Inspired Model","dual visual pathways","human action recognition"]}],"abstract":"Spatio-temporal interesting points feature is a key technology for a wide class of computer vision approaches to recognize human actions.

Poised to shape the way we monitor the environment, wireless sensors has a lot of potentials waiting to be unlocked. Performance of WSN is largely determined by coverage and positioning of the sensor nodes. However, to be accepted as de-facto solution for monitoring different phenomena in our physical world, it is necessary to develop acceptable standards for its configuration and deployment. Motivated by this requirement, this paper investigates Kriging interpolation algorithm as an efficient location management system. With the aid of Kriging interpolation, it will be demonstrated later in this paper how targets of interest can be classified and monitored in a distributed manner for better accuracy. Effectiveness of this method on a large scale was established by applying it to temperature-based sensor network in a dynamic environment. Kriging interpolation sensor management is expected to improve coverage, reduce power consumption and enhance performance of sensor nodes and by extension the network.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923842/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923842/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684088","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Kriging interpolation based sensor node position management in dynamic environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kriging interpolation based sensor node position management in dynamic environment","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p293ali.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067284S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923842","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6923843,"authors":[{"name":"Barbara Suesser-Rechberger","affiliation":["Institute of Microwave and Photonic Engineering, Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Barbara","lastName":"Suesser-Rechberger","id":"37085404418"},{"name":"Michael Bergmann","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks, Satellite Communications Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Bergmann","id":"38341464100"},{"name":"Gerald Hoerack","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks, Satellite Communications Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Hoerack","id":"37085403628"},{"name":"Wilfried Gappmair","affiliation":["Institute of Communication Networks, Satellite Communications Graz University of Technology, Austria"],"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Gappmair","id":"37282870600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923843","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":290},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923843","abstract":"A total throughput of about 100 Gbit/s is state-of-the-art for current communication satellite systems. But next generations are envisaged to improve this by a factor of ten, as postulated by the European Space Agency (ESA) in a recent project, identifying multibeam architectures in combination with an aggressive reuse of frequency bands as crucial enabler technologies. Interference problems, related to this approach, could be mitigated by (joint) precoding and beamforming on the forward link and multi-user detection on the return link. However, these methods necessitate accurate and timely information upon the channel state. In this context, just by exploiting the a priori knowledge about the antenna characteristics and the user terminal position, a novel strategy called location-aware channel estimation (LACE) was published recently; promising results in terms of accuracy and throughput were achieved in this context. The current paper examines and demonstrates the robustness of the LACE concept in case the user position is not perfectly known.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","startPage":"298","endPage":"301","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923843.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robustness analysis of location-aware channel estimation on multibeam satellite links","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Satellites","Feeds","Channel estimation","Estimation","Robustness","MIMO","Satellite communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","channel estimation","frequency allocation","interference suppression","multiuser detection","precoding","satellite links"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robustness analysis","location-aware channel estimation","LACE","multibeam satellite links","European Space Agency","frequency reuse","interference mitigation","precoding","beamforming","forward link","return link","multiuser detection","channel state information","user terminal position"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multibeam satellite links","Location awareness","Channel estimation","MIMO over satellite"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Robustness analysis of location-aware channel estimation on multibeam satellite links","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923843/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923843/","accessionNumber":"14684137","publicationDate":"July 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robustness analysis of location-aware channel estimation on multibeam satellite links","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p298suesserrechberger.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054048S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6923844,"authors":[{"name":"Saheed A.

Given the limited modulation bandwidth of LED, multiple input and multiple output (MIMO) technology appears attractive in VLC systems as multiple LED sources are typically employed in indoor environment to supply sufficient illuminance. For a practical indoor system, there generally exist multiple decentralized user terminals, which composed a multi-user (MU) MIMO VLC system together with multiple LED sources. The main difficulty for the MU-MIMO indoor VLC system is the separation of received data for different user terminal, i.e., multi-user interference (MUI). We have recently proposed an asymmetric system configuration to eliminate MUI in indoor VLC systems. By pre-processing the transmitted data in transmitter, the complexity of user terminals belonging to the proposed system is significantly reduced, leading to the reduction of power consumption. In this paper, a novel multidirectional optical receiver with different field of view (FOV) is proposed to improve the performance of the proposed system. Simulation results show that BER and SNR performances of the system are significantly improved and the majority of indoor region can achieve 100 Mbit/s at a BER of 10\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">-6</sup>\n when single LED chip's power is ~10 mW.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923846","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923846.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923846","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","startPage":"314","endPage":"318","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance improvement of the pre-coded multi-user MIMO indoor visible light communication system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance improvement of the pre-coded multi-user MIMO indoor visible light communication system","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923846/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14683977","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6923846/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance improvement of the pre-coded multi-user MIMO indoor visible light communication system","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p314hong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05428S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923847,"authors":[{"name":"L.

In this paper, we examine the viability of deploying hybrid FSO and radio frequency (RF) links through an experimental study, which takes advantage of a dedicated laboratory atmospheric chamber to emulate the fog scenarios encountered on outdoor environment. In particular, a root mean square power detector is developed and introduced in the system under study to monitor the signal quality of the primary FSO link. The quasi-linear output voltage characteristics of the power detector device is utilized as a useful decision metric to implement hard switching in a hybrid FSO/RF link based upon the changes in the visibility. Our measurement results reveal that the selection of a desirable threshold voltage is dependent upon the intended data rate and minimum achievable bit error rate, in order to enable effective switching between the FSO and RF links.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923856/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6923856/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14684047","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Practical implementation and performance study of a hard-switched hybrid FSO/RF link under controlled fog environment","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical implementation and performance study of a hard-switched hybrid FSO/RF link under controlled fog environment","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p368lee.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098155S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923858,"authors":[{"name":"Rami Al-Dalky","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University of Science Technology and Research, UAE"],"firstName":"Rami","lastName":"Al-Dalky","id":"37085498319"},{"name":"Khaled Salah","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University of Science Technology and Research, UAE"],"firstName":"Khaled","lastName":"Salah","id":"37448520100"},{"name":"Mahmoud Al-Qutayri","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University of Science Technology and Research, UAE"],"firstName":"Mahmoud","lastName":"Al-Qutayri","id":"37266039000"},{"name":"Hadi Otrok","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Khalifa University of Science Technology and Research, UAE"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Otrok","id":"37296104900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923858","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":209},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Framework for a NetFPGA-based Snort NIDS","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923858.pdf","startPage":"380","endPage":"383","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923858","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923858","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Acceleration","Intrusion detection","Hardware","Ports (Computers)","Engines","Monitoring","Radiation detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NetFPGA-based Snort NIDS","high-speed network intrusion detection system","malicious traffic detection","software-based NIDS","single threaded application","deep payload analysis","NetFPGA based hardware"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NetFPGA","Snort","Intrusion detection system","Network Security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923858","abstract":"Network's speed continues to increase at a high rate resulting in massive network traffic. This results in a need to have a high-speed network intrusion detection system (NIDS) to detect malicious traffic. Snort is a software-based NIDS that can run as a single threaded application. However, it may not be able to detect intrusions in real-time especially in networks with high traffic. This paper proposes a two layer framework where Snort will run as a second line of defense and will be executed only when deep payload analysis is needed. To accelerate the efficiency of Snort, the proposed system will dynamically offload the most frequent rules or signatures to a NetFPGA based hardware. The NetFPGA will work as a first line of defense that accelerates the detection by filtering all the traffic looking for intrusions. This will be done by analyzing the captured packet header to match the offloaded rules or signatures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923858/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684059","htmlLink":"/document/6923858/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Framework for a NetFPGA-based Snort NIDS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Framework for a NetFPGA-based Snort NIDS","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p380aldalky.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056967S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923858","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923859,"authors":[{"name":"A.

However, wireless microphones operating in TV bands pose a challenge to TVWS opportunistic access. Efficient and proactive spectrum sensing could prevent harmful interference between collocated devices, but existing spectrum sensing schemes such as energy detection and schemes based on Random Matrix Theory (RMT) have performance limitations. We propose a new blind spectrum sensing scheme with higher performance based on RMT supported by a new formula for the estimation of noise variance.

More importantly, the combination feature vector we have selected is robust to phase noise (PN) influence and carrier frequency offset.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923865.pdf","startPage":"417","endPage":"421","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923865","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923865","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A robust higher-order cyclic cumulants feature-based vector for QAM classification","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quadrature amplitude modulation","Support vector machine classification","Phase noise","Robustness","Frequency modulation","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["higher order statistics","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust higher-order cyclic cumulants feature-based vector","QAM classification","quadrature amplitude modulation signal","CC","probability of correct classification measurement","pattern recognition framework","Pcc values","phase noise","carrier frequency offset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Carrier frequency offset","Cyclic cumulant","Phase noise","Probability of correct classification","QAM"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923865/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"A robust higher-order cyclic cumulants feature-based vector for QAM classification","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923865/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684067","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A robust higher-order cyclic cumulants feature-based vector for QAM classification","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p417jayatunga.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055141S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923865","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923872,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel L\u00f3pez-Ben\u00edtez","affiliation":["Dept.

Models existing to date are able to characterise the statistical properties of spectrum occupancy in only one of its dimensions (time, frequency or space). However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no model capable to account for the properties of spectrum occupancy in all its dimensions simultaneously. Since the development of a single model to characterise spectrum occupancy in such a holistic manner constitutes an extremely challenging task, this work explores an alternative based on the combination of existing dimension-specific models into a unified modelling approach. In particular, a framework is proposed for the integration of spectrum models that have been designed independently for a specific dimension of spectrum occupancy (time, frequency or space), thus enabling the multidimensional modelling of spectrum occupancy. A sophisticated simulation tool implementing state-of-the-art time, frequency and space dimension models is developed according to the proposed framework and used to generate synthetic spectrum data that simultaneously accounts for the properties of spectrum occupancy in all its dimensions. The use of such modelling framework in the context of the simulation of DSA/CR systems is illustrated as well.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923872","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923872.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923872","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","startPage":"453","endPage":"458","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A framework for multidimensional modelling of spectrum occupancy in the simulation of cognitive radio systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923872","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"A framework for multidimensional modelling of spectrum occupancy in the simulation of cognitive radio systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923872/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923872/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14683996","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A framework for multidimensional modelling of spectrum occupancy in the simulation of cognitive radio systems","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p453lopezbenitez.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.100739S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923872","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923873,"authors":[{"name":"Miguel L\u00f3pez-Ben\u00edtez","affiliation":["University of Liverpool, Liverpool, Merseyside, GB"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"L\u00f3pez-Ben\u00edtez","id":"38274759600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923873","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":335},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Estimation","Channel estimation","Correlation","Context","Databases","Complexity theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","cognitive radio","radio spectrum management","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sensing based spectrum awareness","cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum access","spectrum occupancy pattern","primary system","real-time spectrum occupancy","spectrum sensing algorithms","spectrum occupancy estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","dynamic spectrum access","spectrum awareness","spectrum sensing"]}],"abstract":"Owing to the opportunistic nature of its operation principle, the performance of Dynamic Spectrum Access/Cognitive Radio (DSA/CR) systems depends on the spectrum occupancy pattern of primary systems.

This paper provides an overview of relevant research topics related with the problem of providing DSA/CR systems with the ability to gain accurate, reliable and exploitable information on realtime spectrum occupancy.

In the simulation results, two targets are used to show the capability of this approach in resolving multiple targets images which are formed by combining the Range Profile Reconstruction (RPR) with the corresponding Cross-range Profile Reconstruction (CPR) value.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923878","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923878.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923878","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","startPage":"485","endPage":"490","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SAR multiple targets imaging using UWB OFDM signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923878","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"SAR multiple targets imaging using UWB OFDM signals","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923878/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14683989","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6923878/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SAR multiple targets imaging using UWB OFDM signals","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p485buhari.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09994S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923878","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6923884,"authors":[{"name":"Tarik Ghalut","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Ghalut","id":"37085382323"},{"name":"Hadi Larijani","affiliation":["School of Engineering and Built Environment, Glasgow Caledonian University, Glasgow, UK"],"firstName":"Hadi","lastName":"Larijani","id":"37660795600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923884","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":283},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality assessment","PSNR","Video recording","Neurons","Long Term Evolution","Mathematical model","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["4G mobile communication","feedforward neural nets","Long Term Evolution","quality of experience","telecommunication computing","video communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["LTE-Sim software","mean opinion score","packet loss rate","codec","frame rate","resolution size","sender bit rate","gradient descent training algorithm","three layer feed-forward RNN model","prediction model","QoE","quality of experience","4G mobile communication","fourth generation mobile communication","Long Term Evolution","random neural networks","video quality prediction","nonintrusive method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Video quality prediction","LTE","QoE","MOS","RNN"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923884","abstract":"Long Term Evolution (LTE) is the preliminary version of a fourth generation (4G) mobile communication system.

A three layer feed-forward RNN model with gradient descent training algorithm has been developed. This model uses a combination of objective parameters in the application and network layers, such as Content Type (CT), Sender Bit Rate (SBR), resolution size, Frame Rate (FR), codec, and packet loss rate (PLR). The video quality was predicted in terms of the Mean Opinion Score (MOS). The results show an approximate 50% increase in accuracy using this model, compared to previous models.

The transmitter of the proposed scheme is based on a low complexity X-transform that is developed in [1] as a modulation scheme instead of the inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). The proposed ST-X-OFDM scheme massively reduces the transmitter complexity, the effects of multipath channels, and the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). The complexity of the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with the conventional ST-OFDM, showing that the proposed scheme is efficient, fast, and simple in implementation. An exact closed-form bit-error rate (BER) is derived for the proposed scheme over multipath channels and different kinds of modulation formats. Computer simulations corroborated by mathematical results prove that, over frequency-selective multipath channels and different mapping schemes, the proposed approach achieves significant signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain in comparison to the ST-OFDM system. The proposed ST-X-OFDM system adopts only a single, low complexity transform at the transmitter without precoding and achieves significant BER improvement over the conventional ST-OFDM system.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923897","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923897.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923897","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","startPage":"591","endPage":"595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Enhanced Alamouti space-time block-coding transmission based on a developed OFDM system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923897","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Enhanced Alamouti space-time block-coding transmission based on a developed OFDM system","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923897/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684123","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6923897/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Enhanced Alamouti space-time block-coding transmission based on a developed OFDM system","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p591leftah.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057098S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923897","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923903,"authors":[{"name":"Tongyang Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Tongyang","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085413447"},{"name":"Izzat Darwazeh","affiliation":["Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering, University College London, London, UK"],"firstName":"Izzat","lastName":"Darwazeh","id":"37085362912"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923903","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":287},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Interference","OFDM","Bit error rate","Modulation","Complexity theory","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decoding","frequency division multiplexing","iterative methods","quadrature amplitude modulation","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["QAM modulation schemes","fixed sphere decoding","hybrid soft iterative detection","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","nonorthogonal multicarrier communication technique","SEFDM","spectrally efficient frequency division multiplexing","M-QAM signal detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spectrally efficient","modulation","multicarrier communications","non-orthogonal","OFDM","SEFDM","iterative detection","fixed sphere decoder"]}],"abstract":"Spectrally Efficient Frequency Division Multiplexing (SEFDM) is a non-orthogonal multi-carrier communication technique that can pack more sub-carriers than Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for a given bandwidth.

The cross-tier interference mitigation is applied on femtocells clustered by the DAS. The proposed joint cross-tier interference mitigation and femtocell clustering ensures a better average capacity across all end-users in the two-tier network.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923908","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923908.pdf","startPage":"652","endPage":"657","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923908","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint femtocell clustering and cross-tier interference mitigation with distributed antenna system in small cell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923908","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923908/","displayDocTitle":"Joint femtocell clustering and cross-tier interference mitigation with distributed antenna system in small cell networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684161","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923908/","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint femtocell clustering and cross-tier interference mitigation with distributed antenna system in small cell networks","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p652ndong.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082824S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923908","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6923909,"authors":[{"name":"Weisi Guo","affiliation":["School of Engineering, The University of Warwick, UK"],"firstName":"Weisi","lastName":"Guo","id":"38261748300"},{"name":"Conor Devine","affiliation":["School of Engineering, The University of Warwick, UK"],"firstName":"Conor","lastName":"Devine","id":"37085528847"},{"name":"Siyi Wang","affiliation":["Institute for Telecommunications Research, University of South Australia, Australia"],"firstName":"Siyi","lastName":"Wang","id":"38262434200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923909","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":42,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1071},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923909","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Mobile communication","Throughput","Wireless communication","Mobile computing","Quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aircraft communication","autonomous aerial vehicles","cellular radio","relay networks (telecommunication)","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["microunmanned airborne communication relays performance analysis","multicell simulation results","stochastic geometry","large-scale network analysis","coverage zones","trough-to-peak throughput","rural environment","urban environment","field-test results","emergency coverage","wireless relays","SUAV","unmanned-aerial-vehicles","cellular networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["airborne relay","UAV","cellular network"]}],"abstract":"This paper analyses the potential of utilising small unmanned-aerial-vehicles (SUAV) as wireless relays for assisting cellular network performance.

We present field-test results from an SUAV test-bed in both urban and rural environments. The results show that trough-to-peak throughput improvements can be achieved for users in poor coverage zones.

Actually, various transmission and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) modes are defined in long term evolution (LTE) system. For different channel conditions, the base station can switch the MIMO modes adaptively based on the feedback information of user equipment (UE). This paper proposes a MIMO switching algorithm of TD-LTE based on channel quality indicator (CQI) correction. In our proposal, a base station selects a corresponding MIMO mode according to current channel status estimated by using the spectral efficiency of modified CQI and block error rate (BLER). Our proposal can compatibly support the terminal which does not allow antenna alternative transmission in dual-stream beamforming, and reduces the deviation of reported CQI. The simulation results of intra-mode switching and inter-mode switching of TM3 and TM8 justifies the effectiveness of the proposed MIMO switching algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923916","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923916.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923916","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","startPage":"694","endPage":"699","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"MIMO mode switching algorithm based on CQI correction of TD-LTE","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"MIMO mode switching algorithm based on CQI correction of TD-LTE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923916/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684018","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6923916/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"MIMO mode switching algorithm based on CQI correction of TD-LTE","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p694liu.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037748S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6923917,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

This paper investigates the effects of network characteristics on the network performance of a routing scheme called Cognitive Radio Q-routing (CRQ-routing), which applies an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning (RL). CRQ-routing considers the dynamicity and unpredictability of the PUs' activities, and finds least-cost routes to destination nodes in a CR network. Using RL, each SU node observes and learns about its operating environment as time goes by, and subsequently establishes least-cost routes, which help to achieve satisfactory SUs' network performance and minimizes interference to PUs' activities. Simulation results show that, network performance (i.e. SUs' interference to PUs, SUs' end-to-end delay, SUs' packet loss rate, and SUs' throughput) is slightly affected by network characteristics, although the overall network performance degrades as the number of nodes in a CR network increases and there is random placement of destination nodes which causes the length of routes to vary in a particular network. While this paper applies RL, similar trends and circumstances are believed to occur in other kinds of learning mechanisms applied to the CR networks.","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923926","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923926.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923926","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","startPage":"748","endPage":"753","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of network characteristics on learning mechanism for routing in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923926","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Effects of network characteristics on learning mechanism for routing in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923926/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923926/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684154","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of network characteristics on learning mechanism for routing in cognitive radio ad hoc networks","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p748alrawi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072561S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923926","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6923927,"authors":[{"name":"Belarmino Nu\u00f1ez","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Santiago de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Belarmino","lastName":"Nu\u00f1ez","id":"37085565757"},{"name":"Pablo Adasme","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Santiago de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Pablo","lastName":"Adasme","id":"37085565608"},{"name":"Ismael Soto","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Santiago de Chile, Santiago, Chile"],"firstName":"Ismael","lastName":"Soto","id":"38185457800"},{"name":"Jianqiang Cheng","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud XI, Orsay Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Jianqiang","lastName":"Cheng","id":"37085554050"},{"name":"Marc Letournel","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud XI, Orsay Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Letournel","id":"37085559182"},{"name":"Abdel Lisser","affiliation":["Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique, Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud XI, Orsay Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Abdel","lastName":"Lisser","id":"37085553456"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923927","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":115},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Probabilistic logic","Joints","Programming","Numerical models","Resource management","Stochastic processes","Approximation methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear programming","OFDM modulation","probability","radio links","stochastic programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chance constrained approach","uplink wireless OFDMA networks","joint probabilistic constraints","individual probabilistic constraints","resource allocation problem","UL","stochastic linear programming","SLP","second order cone programming","SOCP problems","network subject","power user constraints","subcarrier user constraints","constraint formulation","deterministic joint probabilistic model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Second order cone programming","stochastic programming","probabilistic constraints","linear programming","resource allocation in orthogonal frequency division multiple access"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we compare individual and joint probabilistic constraints for a resource allocation problem in an uplink (UL) wireless OFDMA network.

The mitigation technique involves the utilization of a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) whose gain saturates in normal link operation, but which also provides a power-dependent varying gain when the link experiences a fade. The unbalanced SOA operation serves towards the equalization of the signal power at its output and as a result the link fades become less severe and of reduced duration. Our analytical results predict that the fade probability can be reduced by over 90% under negative-exponential fading conditions, while the scintillation index at the SOA output is also reduced by 75% if an optimal level of received power, and therefore gain saturation, is observed. Finally, our results show that the average duration of fades can also be reduced by a significant percentage of 68% for the same level of gain saturation in the SOA.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Semiconductor optical amplifiers","Fading","Gain","Optical fiber communication","Optical receivers","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["optical communication","semiconductor optical amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["negative-exponential fading condition","optical wireless communication systems","saturated semiconductor optical amplifiers","SOA","OWC systems","normal link operation","power-dependent varying gain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["optical wireless","negative-exponential fading","semiconductor optical amplifier"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923955","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923955.pdf","startPage":"894","endPage":"898","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923955","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Equalization of negative-exponential fading in saturated semiconductor optical amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Equalization of negative-exponential fading in saturated semiconductor optical amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923955/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923955/","accessionNumber":"14684017","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Equalization of negative-exponential fading in saturated semiconductor optical amplifiers","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p894yiannopoulos.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048657S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923955","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6923956,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Use of optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) has been demonstrated as one of the viable schemes in achieving high data rate in VLC system. However, the limitation of optical OFDM still remains the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which results in signal distortion and increase in error rate. In this paper, we describe a technique that can mitigate high PAPR in optical OFDM using pilot symbol in the indoor VLC environment. The pilot assisted OFDM system gives 2.4 dB PAPR reduction for a 4-QAM. There is indication from the simulation results that not only can the technique reduce high PAPR but it also offers good bit error rate (BER) performance.

New architectures with very low-power profile have to be investigated for targeting advanced implementations. In this context, the paper proposes to employ the Compressive Sensing theory for the detection of M-ary orthogonal signals, without complete recovery. This allows to lower the digital baseband computation load for almost equivalent performance. Simulations based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard shows that the BER matches the theoretical results with a tolerable loss, depending mostly on the compression rate. Then, numerical analysis brings out some practical limitations that have to be considered when using this technique. Finally, the paper underlines the innovative use of compressive sensing for reducing the computation load during detection. This flexibility enables the selection of the most efficient operating point.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Non-coherent detection of M-ary orthogonal signals using Compressive Sensing","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923961","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923961.pdf","startPage":"923","endPage":"927","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923961","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923961","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Non-coherent detection of M-ary orthogonal signals using Compressive Sensing","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923961/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684170","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Non-coherent detection of M-ary orthogonal signals using Compressive Sensing","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p923lenoir.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.067181S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923966,"authors":[{"name":"Z.

These new technologies when combined with the multiple layers of a communications network make the analysis of these systems increasingly complex. The work here analyzes the impact of placing a modulated interfering transmission in the guard band of a wireless packet based (infrastructure) network on the end user TCP performance. Wireless networks, such as LTE, employ at the physical layer orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) while at the data-link layer they use hybrid auto-repeat-request (HARQ) and a finite length queue; they also utilize cross-layer optimization to improve performance. These protocols allow the wireless network the ability to adapt to an ever changing fading environment. The following work shows the effect of a modulated interfering signal in the guard band of an OFDM system on the end-to-end TCP performance. In some cases the impact from the interference is indistinguishable from the effects of channel fading.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The impact of interference on an OFDM system with AMC, hybrid ARQ, and a finite queue on end-to-end performance","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923966","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923966.pdf","startPage":"949","endPage":"954","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923966","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6923966","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923966/","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"The impact of interference on an OFDM system with AMC, hybrid ARQ, and a finite queue on end-to-end performance","conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6923966/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","accessionNumber":"14684156","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The impact of interference on an OFDM system with AMC, hybrid ARQ, and a finite queue on end-to-end performance","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p949hijaz.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105266S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923966","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6923969,"authors":[{"name":"Khandker Nadya Haq","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Khandker Nadya","lastName":"Haq","id":"37588853900"},{"name":"Kah-Seng Chung","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Perth, Australia"],"firstName":"Kah-Seng","lastName":"Chung","id":"37367588300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2581-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6923969","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Channel estimation","Signal to noise ratio","Estimation","Receivers","Joints","Frequency-domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel estimation","compensation","distortion","multipath channels","OFDM modulation","radio receivers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["signal distortion","in-phase/quadrature signal processing","MATLAB simulations","pilot tones","frequency domain","channel parameters estimation","OFDM receivers","multipath channel","I/Q imbalance compensation","I/Q imbalance correction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["I/Q imbalance","Correction and compensation","OFDM"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an adaptive scheme in overcoming signal distortion, caused by I/Q imbalance and multipath propagation, in an OFDM receiver.

The proposed system can provide a low cost, flexible, and high-bandwidth access network for multiple users. To investigate the system performance, we consider a special case of dual-hop WDM-FSO system taking into account the effects of all noises, interchannel crosstalk, as well as path loss and geometric spreading of optical beam over atmospheric turbulence channels. In addition, pulse position modulation (PPM) is employed for improving the overall performance. Our results show that OAF technique combined with PPM scheme can be a good solution for mitigating the effect of atmospheric turbulence. Moreover, the required amplifier gain corresponding to a specific value of BER, transmission distance, and turbulence strength is quantitatively discussed. Finally, the adverse effect of interchannel crosstalk in the upstream transmission is also evaluated.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923783","publicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 9th International Symposium on Communication Systems, Networks & Digital Sign (CSNDSP)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913114/6923783/06923995.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923995","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CSNDSP.2014.6923995","startPage":"1106","endPage":"1111","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical amplify-and-forward multihop WDM/FSO for all-optical access networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 July 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6923995/","displayDocTitle":"Optical amplify-and-forward multihop WDM/FSO for all-optical access networks","htmlLink":"/document/6923995/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"23-25 July 2014","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"14684162","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical amplify-and-forward multihop WDM/FSO for all-optical access networks","confLoc":"Manchester, UK","sourcePdf":"p1106trinh.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08398S","chronDate":"23-25 July 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913114","isNumber":"6923783","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913114","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6923783","articleId":"6923995","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6923996,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Jarajreh","affiliation":["Optical Communications Research Group, The University of Northumbria at Newcastle, UK"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Jarajreh","id":"37085372117"},{"name":"S.

By utilizing a precoding scheme in the transmitter, an asymmetric system configuration can be setup to eliminate MUI with much less signal processing in the user terminals.

Although these designs correct external errors in recall, they assume neurons that compute noiselessly, in contrast to the highly variable neurons in brain regions thought to operate associatively, such as hippocampus and olfactory cortex. Here we consider associative memories with boundedly noisy internal computations and analytically characterize performance. As long as the internal noise level is below a specified threshold, the error probability in the recall phase can be made exceedingly small. More surprising, we show that internal noise improves the performance of the recall phase while the pattern retrieval capacity remains intact: the number of stored patterns does not reduce with noise (up to a threshold). Computational experiments lend additional support to our theoretical analysis. This work suggests a functional benefit to noisy neurons in biological neuronal networks.</para>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"MIT Press","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924018/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","isJournal":true,"volume":"26","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Noise Facilitation in Associative Memories of Exponential Capacity","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Noise Facilitation in Associative Memories of Exponential Capacity","sourcePdf":"neco_a_00655.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.025471S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","isNumber":"6924009","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6720226","citationCount":"7","articleId":"6924018","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"MIT Periodical","lastupdate":"2021-11-27"},{"_id":6924050,"authors":[{"name":"Yicun Ouyang","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Yicun","lastName":"Ouyang","id":"37085463688"},{"name":"Hujun Yin","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK"],"firstName":"Hujun","lastName":"Yin","id":"37290463500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2380-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2380-8454"}],"articleNumber":"6924050","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":188},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Time series analysis","Training","Neurons","Predictive models","Neural networks","Standards"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["time series prediction","noncausal neural network","future values","past values","training samples","prediction performance","FX time series"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924050","abstract":"Neural networks have been widely applied to time series prediction over past few decades.

One of the reasons is the lack of thoroughly studies of the market abuse strategies and the corresponding effective market abuse approaches. In this paper, the strategies of reported price manipulation cases are analysed as well as the related empirical studies. A transformation is then defined to convert the time-varying financial trading data into pseudo-stationary time series, where machine learning algorithms can be easily applied to the detection of the price manipulation. The evaluation experiments conducted on four stocks from NASDAQ show a promising improved performance for effectively detecting such manipulation cases.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924057/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14666212","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924057/","publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"27-28 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Detecting price manipulation in the financial market","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting price manipulation in the financial market","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"21PaperCIFEr2014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07421S","chronDate":"27-28 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6901616","isNumber":"6924035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6901616","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"6924035","articleId":"6924057","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6924069,"authors":[{"name":"Chetan Saran Mehra","affiliation":["Electronics and Computer Science, Southampton University, Southampton, UK"],"firstName":"Chetan Saran","lastName":"Mehra","id":"37085427604"},{"name":"Adam Prugel-Bennett","affiliation":["Electronics and Computer Science, Southampton University"],"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Prugel-Bennett","id":"38271326100"},{"name":"Enrico Gerding","affiliation":["Electronics and Computer Science, Southampton University"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Gerding","id":"37285008100"},{"name":"Valentin Robu","affiliation":["Electronics and Computer Science, Southampton University"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Robu","id":"37284845300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-2380-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2380-8454"}],"articleNumber":"6924069","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":323},"abstract":"In this paper we present a smart portfolio management methodology, which advances existing portfolio management techniques at two distinct levels.

We then build a meta-model which uses the Kelly criterion to determine an optimal allocation over these investment strategies, thus simultaneously capturing regimes operating in the data over different time horizons. Finally, in order to detect changes in the relevant data regime, and hence investment allocations, we use a forecasting algorithm which relies on a Kalman filter. We call our combined method, that uses both the Kelly criterion and the Kalman filter, the K2 algorithm. Using a large-scale historical dataset of both stocks and indices, we show that our K2 algorithm gives better risk adjusted returns in terms of the Sharpe ratio, better average gain to average loss ratio and higher probability of success compared to existing benchmarks, when measured in out-of-sample tests.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Portfolios","Kalman filters","Investment","Time series analysis","Resource management","Data models","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["investment","Kalman filters","resource allocation","stock markets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["smart portfolio management methodology","data driven quantitative investment models","meta-model","Kelly criterion","optimal allocation","data regime","investment allocations","forecasting algorithm","Kalman filter","K2 algorithm","stock dataset","index dataset","Sharpe ratio","average loss ratio","out-of-sample test"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CIFEr.2014.6924069","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6901616/6924035/06924069.pdf","startPage":"166","endPage":"173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFEr.2014.6924069","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Constructing smart portfolios from data driven quantitative investment models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924069","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Constructing smart portfolios from data driven quantitative investment models","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924069/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924069/","accessionNumber":"14666201","conferenceDate":"27-28 March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 March 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Constructing smart portfolios from data driven quantitative investment models","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"33PaperCIFEr2014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06021S","chronDate":"27-28 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6901616","isNumber":"6924035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6901616","xplore-issue":"6924035","articleId":"6924069","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6924082,"authors":[{"name":"Eduardo Gerlein","affiliation":["University of Ulster, UK"],"firstName":"Eduardo","lastName":"Gerlein","id":"37085449265"},{"name":"T.

Novel computational infrastructures and trading strategies are required to support the massive amount of incoming streaming data, where the main problem is in latency management. Multi-agent Systems have been recognized as a promising solution to address complex problems in many areas such as biology, social sciences and financial markets and may provide powerful and flexible solutions for implementing trading engines. In addition, reconfigurable hardware based on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offers many important performance benefits over software implementations, such as reducing decision making latency and high-throughput data processing. Robust and scalable trading engines can be developed by leveraging the benefits of reconfigurable FPGA platforms. This paper presents a multi-agent architecture in reconfigurable hardware for financial applications and the implementation of a trading engine for pre-trade analysis as a validation scenario.

An agent's risk profile is his attitude to perceived risk, which can vary from risk preferring to risk neutral (an expected-value decision maker) to risk averse. We use the Genetic Algorithm to search in the complex stochastic space of repeated lotteries. We find that agents with a CARA utility function learn to possess risk-neutral risk profiles. Since CARA utility functions are wealth-independent, this is not surprising. When agents have wealth-dependent, CRRA utility functions, however, they also learn to possess risk profiles that are about risk neutral (from slightly risk-averse to even slightly risk-preferring), which is surprising.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924035","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIFEr.2014.6924096","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering & Economics (CIFEr)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6901616/6924035/06924096.pdf","startPage":"365","endPage":"369","doi":"10.1109/CIFEr.2014.6924096","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Learning to be risk averse?","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-28 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Learning to be risk averse?","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-28 March 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6924096/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14666188","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924096/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Learning to be risk averse?","confLoc":"London, UK","sourcePdf":"60PaperCIFEr2014.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036149S","chronDate":"27-28 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6901616","isNumber":"6924035","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6901616","xplore-issue":"6924035","articleId":"6924096","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6924121,"authors":[{"name":"Beno\u00eet Charbonnier","affiliation":["Orange Labs, Lannion, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4563700/6924116/6924121/6924121-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Beno\u00eet Charbonnier received his engineering degree in 1994 from Ecole Nationale Suprieure des Telecommunications de Paris and received his Ph.D. degree in 1997 on 40 Gbps soliton transmission from the same institution.

The complex mathematical model of the fuel cell system is substituted with the black box neural network model that provides an appropriate mapping between the input and output parameters. The performance comparison of the two different cascaded connected neural networks is carried out to examine the prediction ability of the proposed network models in terms of error minimization value and convergence rate. The optimum network acquired from the comparative analysis can be used as an ancillary model instead of using a complex fuel cell model for developing any kind of fuel cell powered application. An attempt is made in this paper to use the neural network based fuel cell approach in the transportation sector for developing an electric vehicle model. This paper is also focused on the design, modeling and simulation of the optimal ANN based fuel cell operated electric vehicle and the performance of the proposed electric vehicle model is analyzed based on the two different drive cycle (M-UDDS & M-NEDC) on which they are operated. The simulation results obtained from the proposed electric vehicle model are used to evaluate the vehicle performance in terms of maximum distance coverage, amount of fuel consumption and comparison of the required vehicle power with the available power delivered by the energy source for the use of modified UDDS & NEDC drive cycle pattern.

While the objectives are maximization of average torque and minimization of cogging torque in the BLDC motor, magnet length, air gap and stator slot opening are considered as the design variables. The results obtained using the PSO algorithm indicate that it is capable of giving better design solutions when compared and investigated with those obtained from Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) based simulation. The results also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more effective and outperforms GA in terms of solution quality, accuracy, constraint handling and computational time.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-9 Jan. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924153/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14684981","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924153/","publicationDate":"Jan. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"7-9 Jan. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Design optimization of brushless DC motor using Particle Swarm Optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design optimization of brushless DC motor using Particle Swarm Optimization","confLoc":"Chennai, India","sourcePdf":"RP022192.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080426S","chronDate":"7-9 Jan. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916491","isNumber":"6924130","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916491","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6924130","articleId":"6924153","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6924169,"authors":[{"name":"Dogga Raveendhra","affiliation":["EEE Department, Graphic Era University, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Dogga","lastName":"Raveendhra","id":"38233883800"},{"name":"Rahul Kumar","affiliation":["EEE Department, Graphic Era University, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Rahul","lastName":"Kumar","id":"38574662800"},{"name":"Shailendra Singh","affiliation":["EEE Department, Graphic Era University, Dehradun, India"],"firstName":"Shailendra","lastName":"Singh","id":"37085517412"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3739-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3738-7","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6924169","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":349},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924169","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inverters","Photonics","Decision support systems","Equations","Conferences","Equivalent circuits","Kirchhoff's Law"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diodes","field programmable gate arrays","graphical user interfaces","invertors","photovoltaic power systems","power system control","solar power stations","switching convertors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["clock frequencies","firing pulses","system generator tool","switching frequency","FPGA controller","controllable switches","solar PV DC supply","RL load","lagging power factor","Simulink powerful graphical user interface tool","MATLAB Simulink environments","Xilinx system generator","AC loads","DC loads","charge controller","solar PV modules","solar PV based DC bus","SPV system","two-stage solar photovoltaic system","central three-level diode clamped inverter"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Diode Clamped Multi Level Inverter","FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) Controller","SPV(Solar Photo Voltaic) DC system","SPWM(Synchronized Pulse Width Modulation)","Three-Level Inverter"]}],"abstract":"This paper includes the discussion about the principle of working, performance investigation and simulation of FPGA controlled three-level diode clamped inverter, which is fed by solar PV based DC bus.

Due to the spatial sparsity of number of girds containing an object (comparing with the total number of grids in the region of interest), the localization problem can be transferred into recovering a spare index vector, which is reformulated as a Bayesian estimation problem according to the BCS theory. The proposed method is relieved from the requirement on accurate prior position knowledge of beacon nodes. Besides, by building location fingerprinting based on both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) measurements, the proposed method is robust and applicable to mixed LOS/NLOS environment. Finally, simulation examples are included to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/6921523/6924277/06924290.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"30","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Services","doi":"10.1109/MobServ.2014.13","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MobServ.2014.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924277","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924290","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Bayesian Compressed Sensing Approach to Robust Object Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bayes methods","Vectors","Wireless sensor networks","Noise measurement","Compressed sensing","Robustness","Indexes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","compressed sensing","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["location-based services","LBS","robust object localization approaches","Bayesian compressed sensing","BCS","wireless sensor network","spatial sparsity","localization problem","spare index vector","Bayesian estimation problem","beacon nodes","location fingerprinting","line-of-sight measurement","nonline-of-sight measurement","LOS-NLOS environment"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["object localization","Bayesian compressed sensing","wireless sensor network","non-line-of-sight"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924290/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Bayesian Compressed Sensing Approach to Robust Object Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924290/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14685458","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Bayesian Compressed Sensing Approach to Robust Object Localization in Wireless Sensor Networks","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5060a024.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065076S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6921523","isNumber":"6924277","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6921523","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6924277","articleId":"6924290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6924301,"authors":[{"name":"Ivor D.

The current functionalities of this scalable framework cover memory and time analysis, as well as automatic deadlock-free code generation. Several tutorials are provided with the tool for fast initiation of C programmers to multicore DSP programming.

The baseband system level design is done using Matlab/Simulink and the deployment on the TMS320C6713 DSKs is performed by means of IDE link via automatic code generation directly from Simulink blocks, offering a flexible way from system level design and simulation to actual implementation and verification. The wireless part is built based on conventional components and employs two transmit and one receive antennas. For both SISO and MISO, all the basic building blocks are comprised also including Maximum Likelihood (ML) synchronization based on the cyclic prefix as well as sampling clock frequency offset estimation and compensation. The implemented test-bed is intended primarily for educational demonstration and experimentation purposes for highlighting and studying several concepts and phenomena not only regarding the modulation schemes but the wireless link as a whole. Typical results for the experimental demonstration and evaluation of the system are presented.","doi":"10.1109/EDERC.2014.6924366","publicationTitle":"2014 6th European Embedded Design in Education and Research Conference (EDERC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 6th European Embedded Design in Education and Research Conference (EDERC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917608/6924338/06924366.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EDERC.2014.6924366","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924338","startPage":"95","endPage":"99","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deployment of 5GHZ real-time simplex wireless SISO- and MISO-OFDM transmission using matlab and the TMS320C6713 DSKS","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924366","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deployment of 5GHZ real-time simplex wireless SISO- and MISO-OFDM transmission using matlab and the TMS320C6713 DSKS","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-12 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924366/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-12 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14685331","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6924366/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deployment of 5GHZ real-time simplex wireless SISO- and MISO-OFDM transmission using matlab and the TMS320C6713 DSKS","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"1095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043799S","chronDate":"11-12 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917608","isNumber":"6924338","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917608","xplore-issue":"6924338","articleId":"6924366","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6924381,"authors":[{"name":"Julien Heulot","affiliation":["UMR CNRS 6164, UEB, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Julien","lastName":"Heulot","id":"37074010700"},{"name":"Maxime Pelcat","affiliation":["UMR CNRS 6164, UEB, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Maxime","lastName":"Pelcat","id":"37546123600"},{"name":"Karol Desnos","affiliation":["UMR CNRS 6164, UEB, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Karol","lastName":"Desnos","id":"38541439300"},{"name":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Nezan","affiliation":["UMR CNRS 6164, UEB, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Fran\u00e7ois","lastName":"Nezan","id":"37328514100"},{"name":"Slaheddine Aridhi","affiliation":["Texas Instrument France, Cagnes-Sur-Mer"],"firstName":"Slaheddine","lastName":"Aridhi","id":"37443131400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6843-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6841-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6924381","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":183},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924381","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Multicore processing","Hardware","Timing","Benchmark testing","Signal processing algorithms","Finite impulse response filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital signal processing chips","multiprocessing systems","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["parameterized dataflow model of computation","multicore architectures","locally static regions","multicore signal processing benchmark","8-core Texas Instruments Keystone I Digital Signal Processor","OpenMP framework","latency improvements","real-time operating system","multicore DSPS","synchronous parameterized and interfaced dataflow-based RTOS","Spider"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces a novel Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) based on a parameterized dataflow Model of Computation (MoC).

Many works proposed to mitigate this problem by creating a companion of tools to support the designer during the development phase for this technology. The EU FASTER Project aims at realizing an integrated toolchain that assists the designer in the steps of the design flow that are necessary to port a given application onto an FPGA device. The novelty of the framework relies in the fact that the partial dynamic reconfiguration, which FPGA devices can exploit, is seen as a first class citizen throughout the whole design flow. This work reports a case study in which the FASTER toolchain has been used to port a raytracer application onto the STM Spear prototyping embedded platform. The paper discusses the steps done for the realization of the prototype and the results obtained on the target device. It finally reports some improvements that can be exploited to improve the performance of the hardware implementation that has been realized.","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2014.26","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2014.26","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6921428/6924413/06924439.pdf","startPage":"134","endPage":"141","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924413","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924439/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Design Using the FASTER Toolchain: The Case of STM Spear Development Board","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14685443","htmlLink":"/document/6924439/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Design Using the FASTER Toolchain: The Case of STM Spear Development Board","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4293a134.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084033S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6921428","isNumber":"6924413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6921428","xplore-issue":"6924413","articleId":"6924439","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6924440,"authors":[{"name":"Gianluca C.

Furthermore these systems usually have to execute multiple concurrent tasks without any apriori knowledge on expected arrival times, in an unpredictable and very dynamic environment. This scenario has propelled an interest towards self-adaptive systems that dynamically reorganize the use of system resources to optimize for a given goal. The SAVE project will develop a Heterogeneous System Architecture that will decide at runtime to execute task on the appropriate kind of resources, based on the current requirements. This paper presents a first implementation of a resource allocation policy that dynamically shares heterogeneous resources between multiple running applications. Resource allocation mechanisms are discussed and evaluated in an experimental campaign, showing how the policy helps in attaining users' applications goals.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6921428/6924413/06924440.pdf","startPage":"142","endPage":"149","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2014.27","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2014.27","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924413","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runtime Resource Management in Heterogeneous System Architectures: The SAVE Approach","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Actuators","Runtime","Optimization","Resource management","Computer architecture","Graphics processing units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","virtualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["runtime resource management","heterogeneous system architecture","SAVE approach","processing elements","performance-energy trade-off","self-adaptive systems","system resources","resource allocation policy","self-adaptive virtualisation-aware high- performance-low-energy heterogeneous system architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous systems","Virtualization","Resource Allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Runtime Resource Management in Heterogeneous System Architectures: The SAVE Approach","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924440/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14685446","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime Resource Management in Heterogeneous System Architectures: The SAVE Approach","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4293a142.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082744S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6921428","isNumber":"6924413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6921428","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6924413","articleId":"6924440","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6924453,"authors":[{"name":"Xi Li","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Li","id":"37085344954"},{"name":"Beilei Sun","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Beilei","lastName":"Sun","id":"37085370179"},{"name":"Zongwei Zhu","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Zongwei","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38486942000"},{"name":"Chao Wang","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085437216"},{"name":"Xuehai Zhou","affiliation":["Suzhou Institute for Advanced Study, University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), Suzhou, China"],"firstName":"Xuehai","lastName":"Zhou","id":"37406428200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4293-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-9178"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-9208"}],"articleNumber":"6924453","dbTime":"20 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":218},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Random access memory","Switches","Computer architecture","Benchmark testing","Computers","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","operating system kernels","storage management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["kernel-user space separation","DRAM memory space","software performance","memory wall","DRAM latency","row-buffer hit rate","operating system","kernel-space","K/U-aware page-allocation-system","DRAM memory controller address mapping schemes","PARSEC suites"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["DRAM","Row-Buffer Hit","Kernel","User"]}],"abstract":"Performance of software is increasingly restricted by the Memory Wall instead of CPU. Many studies focus on alleviating the DRAM latency by improving the row-buffer hit rate. But most of them treat the Kernel and User equally. Data used by Operating System and User applications spread in different rows of the same bank, leading to the contentions for the row-buffer when they access the bank successively. We find that contentions between Kernel and User make up of a great proportion of all the row-buffer misses. To alleviate the contentions between Kernel and User, we divide the united DRAM memory space into Kernel-Space and User-Space. A new page-allocation-system, the K/U-Aware page-allocation-system, is proposed to manage Kernel-Space and User-Space in DRAM memory in different address mapping schemes of DRAM memory controller. In the new system, pages are allocated from different spaces according to applicants (Kernel or User). Sizes of the two spaces increase and decrease dynamically as required. For benchmarks in PARSEC suites, the proposed system reduces the contentions of Kernel and User effectively, producing significant improvements of row-buffer hit rate. The execution time is reduced by 9.45% (max. 20.45%) and 6.51% (max. 18.05%) respectively in two typical address mapping schemes.","doi":"10.1109/ISPA.2014.40","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing with Applications","pdfPath":"/iel7/6921428/6924413/06924453.pdf","startPage":"237","endPage":"241","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISPA.2014.40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924413","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel-User Space Separation in DRAM Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"26-28 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924453/","displayDocTitle":"Kernel-User Space Separation in DRAM Memory","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924453/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"26-28 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14685449","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel-User Space Separation in DRAM Memory","confLoc":"Milan, Italy","sourcePdf":"4293a237.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.116729S","chronDate":"26-28 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6921428","isNumber":"6924413","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6921428","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6924413","articleId":"6924453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-07"},{"_id":6924462,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenghua Lv","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Zhenghua","lastName":"Lv","id":"37085484311"},{"name":"Huadong Meng","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Huadong","lastName":"Meng","id":"37276216000"},{"name":"Tianyu Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Tianyu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085479109"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4568-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4570-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6924462","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":121},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924462","abstract":"This paper describes the architecture and the implementation of a spectrum sensing platform based on cloud computing.

Cloud computing is one of these creative concepts that allowed companies to further taking advantage of their potential. Cloud computing is assisting companies to execute their business plans more efficiently. As cloud computing has multi-tenancy structure, availability and efficiency of the resources is essential foundation of the cloud architecture. Recent studies showed that, optimized cloud computing could be seen as an elastic network of resources that are interacting with each other, to minimize the waiting time and utilize the throughput. Therefore load balancing and resource management can be highlighted as the main concerns in cloud computing as they are impacting the network performance directly. This research aims to discuss the current challenges existing in load balancing algorithms. Different metrics and policies of the relevant load balancer algorithms have been investigated and as a result, collective behavior has been proposed as a new policy for classification of elasticity mechanism in load balancing.","doi":"10.1109/APCASE.2014.6924463","publicationTitle":"2014 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Aided System Engineering (APCASE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 Asia-Pacific Conference on Computer Aided System Engineering (APCASE)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6900042/6924458/06924463.pdf","startPage":"5","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924458","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/APCASE.2014.6924463","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cloud computing \u2014 The effect of generalized spring tensor algorithm on load balancing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924463/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Cloud computing \u2014 The effect of generalized spring tensor algorithm on load balancing","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924463/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"Feb. 2014","accessionNumber":"14666102","conferenceDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cloud computing \u2014 The effect of generalized spring tensor algorithm on load balancing","confLoc":"South Kuta, Indonesia","sourcePdf":"12CloudComputingEffectofCollectiveBehaviour.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.095104S","chronDate":"10-12 Feb. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6900042","isNumber":"6924458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6900042","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6924458","articleId":"6924463","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6924473,"authors":[{"name":"Agus Eko Minarno","affiliation":["Jurusan Teknik Informatika, Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang, Malang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Agus Eko","lastName":"Minarno","id":"37085458706"},{"name":"Yuda Munarko","affiliation":["Jurusan Teknik Informatika, Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang, Malang, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Yuda","lastName":"Munarko","id":"37085468205"},{"name":"Fitri Bimantoro","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Fitri","lastName":"Bimantoro","id":"37085456243"},{"name":"Arrie Kurniawardhani","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Arrie","lastName":"Kurniawardhani"},{"name":"Nanik Suciati","affiliation":["Institut Teknologi Sepuluh November, Surabaya, Indonesia"],"firstName":"Nanik","lastName":"Suciati","id":"37670661900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4568-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4570-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6924473","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image color analysis","Image edge detection","Feature extraction","Quantization (signal)","Image retrieval","Kernel","Shape"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","image colour analysis","image retrieval"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["batik image retrieval","feature extraction","enhanced microstructure descriptor","EMSD","microstructure map","color similarity","edge orientation values"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image retrieval","batik","micro-structure descriptor"]}],"abstract":"This paper describes a novel method for extracting features of batik images.

The features are based on sample mean and sample variance of the imaginary part of the product of two consecutive complex signal values. Root raised cosine pulses are used to generate the linearly modulated signals. Support vector machines are employed to distinguish the signals. One benefit of using support vector machines is that it requires very few realizations for training. Moreover, no a priori information is required about carrier amplitude, carrier phase, carrier offset, symbol rate, pulse shape, initial symbol phase (timing offset) and channel impulse response. Effectiveness of the features and signal separation by support vector machines is tested by observing the joint effects of additive white Gaussian noise, carrier offset, lack of symbol and sampling synchronization, and either fast or slow fading. In the course of doing that, the proposed classifier is compared to the wavelet based classifier, equipped by support vector machines.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2363615","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6936403/06924714.pdf","startPage":"613","endPage":"617","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2363615","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6936403","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Simple Features for Separating CPFSK from QAM and PSK Modulations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924714","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924714/","displayDocTitle":"Simple Features for Separating CPFSK from QAM and PSK Modulations","volume":"22","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"14708969","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924714/","dateOfInsertion":"05 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simple Features for Separating CPFSK from QAM and PSK Modulations","sourcePdf":"lsp-bari-2363615-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067752S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6936403","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6936403","articleId":"6924714","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6924716,"authors":[{"name":"J.

In addition, 0.9-dB peak Q-factor improvement is also secured after 960-km standard single mode fiber transmission. Furthermore, using the proposed joint DSP technique, linewidth tolerance is relaxed from 80 to 230 kHz given 1-dB required-OSNR penalty. Meanwhile, reduction of block-size for carrier phase recovery is also secured, taking 100-kHz linewidth into account.","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2014.2363162","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/6990718/06924728.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2014.2363162","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6990718","startPage":"129","endPage":"132","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linewidth-Tolerant Joint Digital Signal Processing for 16QAM Nyquist WDM Superchannel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924728","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Linewidth-Tolerant Joint Digital Signal Processing for 16QAM Nyquist WDM Superchannel","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15, 15 2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924728/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"27","issue":"2","publicationDate":"15 Jan.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"14818199","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6924728/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2010CB328302"},{"fundingName":"863 High Technology Plan","grantNumber":"2012AA011301"},{"fundingName":"National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Project","grantNumber":"2013YQ16048702"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61275069 and 61331010"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linewidth-Tolerant Joint Digital Signal Processing for 16QAM Nyquist WDM Superchannel","sourcePdf":"lpt-fu-2363162-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091973S","chronDate":"Jan.15, 15 2015","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6990718","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6990718","articleId":"6924728","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6924731,"authors":[{"name":"Ahmed El Shafie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, TX, USA"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"El Shafie","id":"38259650100"},{"name":"Mohammad Galal Khafagy","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Mohammad Galal","lastName":"Khafagy","id":"38342301500"},{"name":"Ahmed Sultan","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Thuwal, Saudi Arabia"],"firstName":"Ahmed","lastName":"Sultan","id":"38139730000"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1089-7798"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2558"},{"format":"CD","value":"2373-7891"}],"articleNumber":"6924731","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":15,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":410},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Relays","Throughput","Markov processes","Random access memory","Rayleigh channels","Delays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","optimisation","radio links","relay networks (telecommunication)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["relay assisted link","buffer state information","random access scheme","three node network","finite buffer","relay networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Buffer-aided relay,","BSI","CSI","linear-fractional program","Markov chain","queuing theory"]},{"kwd":["Buffer-aided relay","BSI","CSI","linear-fractional program","Markov chain","queuing theory"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimization of a Relay-Assisted Link With Buffer State Information at the Source","doi":"10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2363115","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6965693","endPage":"2152","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/4234/6965693/06924731.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCOMM.2014.2363115","startPage":"2149","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924731","abstract":"This letter proposes a random-access scheme employed by a source in a three-node network composed of a source, a relay, and a destination.

To achieve this target, we formulate a generalized multiobjective optimization (MOOP) problem that jointly maximizes the transmission rate of the SU and minimizes the cochannel interference (CCI) and adjacent channel interference (ACI) to existing PUs. We additionally constrain the allowed CCI and ACI to the PUs to guarantee the PUs' protection from harmful interference. The MOOP problem is solved by linearly combining the normalized competing objective functions - through weighting coefficients - into a single objective function. Prior work in the literature that maximizes the SU transmission rate can be considered as a special case of the generalized MOOP problem by setting the weighting coefficients associated with interference minimization to zero. Since estimating the full channel state information (CSI) of the links between the SU transmitter and the PU receivers is practically challenging, we assume only partial CSI knowledge of these links. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and quantify the SU performance loss due to incomplete CSI knowledge. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art techniques, and our performance results show that the proposed algorithm is more energy aware, yet with reduced complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Rate\u2013Interference Tradeoff in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2363172","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7268796/06924740.pdf","startPage":"4292","endPage":"4298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2363172","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7268796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924740","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924740/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Rate\u2013Interference Tradeoff in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"64","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6924740/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456572","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002956","fundingName":"Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Rate\u2013Interference Tradeoff in OFDM-Based Cognitive Radio Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-bedeer-2363172-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.138228S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7268796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"7268796","articleId":"6924740","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6924747,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Fasthuber","affiliation":["imec, Leuven, Belgium","Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/7274516/6924747/fasth-2360066-small.gif","p":["Robert Fasthuber received the M.Sc. degree in hardware and software systems engineering from the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Hagenberg, Austria, in 2007 and the Ph.D. degree from Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (KU Leuven), Leuven, Belgium, in 2012.","He has performed research with the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland, at imec, Leuven, Belgium, and KU Leuven, since 2007.

To cope with this immense increase of requirements, new design approaches are a necessity. This paper focuses on the design of an advanced multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) detector, which is typically a bottleneck in the wireless receiver. In the proposed template-based design approach innovative architecture concepts, such as very wide register and distributed loop buffer, and algorithm-architecture co-optimizations are combined. The resulting MIMO detector processor, which is scalable to eight and more antennas, achieves a high area efficiency of 571 GOPS/mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and a high energy efficiency of 3.3 GOPS/mW in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 40-nm technology. By exploiting the dynamically varying requirements, the proposal has the potential to achieve a higher average energy efficiency than an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) equivalent. However, a penalty in total area consumption exists. The proposed architecture style offers an interesting and a very promising tradeoff in between the traditional ASIC and the other programmable processor solutions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE

multiplexing system as a QPSK and quadrature duobinary (QDB) signal using maximum likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE) and maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion with both simulations and experiments. Three different detection schemes are studied: 1) QPSK detection with a multitap linear equalizer followed by a MLSE or MAP detector; 2) QPSK detection with only a MLSE or MAP detector; and 3) QDB detection with a MLSE or MAP detector, where a multitap linear equalizer and a delay-&-add operation are placed before the MLSE/MAP detector to convert a QPSK signal to a QDB signal. Our simulations and experiments show that the QDB detection with multitap MLSE does not provide better performance than that with two-tap MLSE, and the QDB detection with two-tap MLSE has better filtering tolerance than the QPSK detection with linear equalization followed by a multitap MLSE/MAP detector.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6974942","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LPT.2014.2362981","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Technology Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/68/6974942/06924750.pdf","startPage":"105","endPage":"108","doi":"10.1109/LPT.2014.2362981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Advanced Detection Techniques for QPSK Signals in Super-Nyquist WDM Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.1, 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Advanced Detection Techniques for QPSK Signals in Super-Nyquist WDM Systems","volume":"27","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6924750/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"1 Jan.1, 2015","accessionNumber":"14807097","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924750/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"863 Program through the National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2012AA011301"},{"fundingName":"973 Program through the National Basic Research Program of China","grantNumber":"2010CB328204"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"62171189 and 61302085"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Advanced Detection Techniques for QPSK Signals in Super-Nyquist WDM Systems","sourcePdf":"lpt-chen-2362981-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051226S","chronDate":"Jan.1, 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"68","isNumber":"6974942","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"68","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6974942","articleId":"6924750","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6924753,"authors":[{"name":"Romain Postoyan","affiliation":["Universit\u00e9 de Lorraine, CRAN, UMR 7039, CNRS, CRAN, UMR 7039, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9/7064679/6924753/posto-2363603-small.gif","p":["\nRomain Postoyan was born in Paris, France, in 1982.

This paradigm is especially well suited for embedded systems and networked control systems since it is able to reduce the amount of communication and computation resources needed for control, compared to the traditional periodic implementation. In this paper, we propose a framework for the event-triggered stabilization of nonlinear systems using hybrid systems tools, that is general enough to encompass most of the existing event-triggered control techniques, which we revisit and generalize. We also derive two new event-triggering conditions which may further enlarge the inter-event times compared to the available policies in the literature as illustrated by two physical examples. These novel techniques exemplify the relevance of introducing additional variables for the design of the triggering law. The proposed approach as well as the new event-triggering strategies are flexible and we believe that they can be used to address other event-based control problems.","doi":"10.1109/TAC.2014.2363603","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control","pdfPath":"/iel7/9/7064679/06924753.pdf","startPage":"982","endPage":"996","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2014.2363603","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7064679","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Framework for the Event-Triggered Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924753","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924753/","displayDocTitle":"A Framework for the Event-Triggered Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems","volume":"60","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15012960","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924753/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European 7th Framework Network of Excellence \u201cHighly-complex and networked control systems\u201d (HYCON2)","grantNumber":"257462"},{"fundingName":"NSF"},{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Framework for the Event-Triggered Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems","sourcePdf":"tac-postoyan-2363603-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120622S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9","isNumber":"7064679","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9","citationCount":"371","xplore-issue":"7064679","articleId":"6924753","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":6924757,"authors":[{"name":"Masaki Wada","affiliation":["NTT Access Network Service Systems Laboratories, NTT Corporation, Tsukuba, Japan"],"bio":{"p":["Masaki Wada received the B.E. and M.E. degrees from Hokkaido\n University, Hokkaido, Japan, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

However, these techniques require an accurate knowledge of the channel of the different users at the transmitter. In frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems, this information has to be provided by the different users, motivating the research of efficient limited feedback schemes. This paper presents a novel statistical characterization of the spatial multiple-input-single-output (MISO) channel. In this characterization, one antenna is selected as the reference, and the channel fading experienced from this antenna is also considered to be the reference. The conditional probability density functions (CPDFs) of the envelope and phase of the channel fading coefficients from the rest of the antennas (denoted as nonreference channel fading and nonreference antennas) are obtained given the reference one. Based on this statistical characterization, this paper proposes a channel quantization scheme that individually quantizes the channel fading coefficient of each transmit antenna that is seen by each user. The envelope and phase of the reference channel fading are quantized considering a Rayleigh distribution and a uniform distribution, respectively. The nonreference channel fading coefficients are quantized according to their respective CPDFs, which in turn depend on the spatial correlation between each channel fading and the reference channel fading. Numerical simulations have been carried out to compare the performance of the proposed conditional quantization (CQ) scheme with a polar quantization (PQ) and with a quantization based on the Karhunen-Lo\u00e8ve (KL) transform. PQ does not consider spatial correlation, CQ needs one spatial correlation coefficient per nonreference antenna, and the KL scheme makes use of the full spatial correlation matrix. The results show that CQ achieves a lower quantization mean square error (MSE) than the other two schemes in highly and moderately correlated environments. When the spatial channel model (SCM) is considered, the proposed scheme allows the spatial correlation to be successfully exploited in arrays with \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n = 4 and \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">N</i>\n = 8 transmit antennas for antenna separations that are lower than \n<i xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">d</i>\n= 1.3\u03bb and d=0.75\u03bb, respectively.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2363170","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7268796/06924760.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2363170","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7268796","startPage":"3931","endPage":"3943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Channel Quantization Based on the Statistical Characterization of Spatially Correlated Fading","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Channel Quantization Based on the Statistical Characterization of Spatially Correlated Fading","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924760/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456540","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6924760/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"European Union ERDF and Spanish Government through Project TEC2012-38142-C04"},{"fundingName":"Generalitat Valenciana through Project PROMETEOII/2014/003"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Quantization Based on the Statistical Characterization of Spatially Correlated Fading","sourcePdf":"tvt-domene-2363170-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113297S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7268796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"7268796","articleId":"6924760","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6924762,"authors":[{"name":"Ejaz Ahmed","affiliation":["Department of Computer System & Technology, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7393921/6924762/ahmed-2363082-small.gif","p":["\nEjaz Ahmed (S'13) was born in Gandhian, Mansehra, Pakistan.

The cognitive radio is capable of opportunistically using the available portions of a licensed spectrum to improve the application performance for unlicensed users. The opportunistic use of the available channels in the wireless environment requires dynamic channel assignment to efficiently utilize the available resources while minimizing the interference in the network. A challenging aspect of such algorithms is the incorporation of the channels' diverse characteristics, highly dynamic network conditions with respect to primary users' activity, and different fragmented sizes of the available channels. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art channel assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks. We also classify the algorithms by presenting a thematic taxonomy of the current channel assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks. Moreover, the critical aspects of the current channel assignment algorithms in cognitive radio networks are analyzed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of such algorithms. The similarities and differences of the algorithms based on the important parameters, such as routing dependencies, channel models, assignment methods, execution model, and optimization objectives, are also investigated. We also discuss open research issues and challenges of channel assignment in the cognitive radio networks.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924762/","volume":"18","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/6924762/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15752735","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Channel Assignment Algorithms in Cognitive Radio Networks: Taxonomy, Open Issues, and Challenges","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003093","fundingName":"Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia"},{"fundingName":"University of Malaya High Impact Research","grantNumber":"UM.C/625/1/HIR/MOE/FCSIT/03"},{"fundingName":"Bright Spark Unit, University of Malaya, Malaysia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Channel Assignment Algorithms in Cognitive Radio Networks: Taxonomy, Open Issues, and Challenges","sourcePdf":"comst-ahmed-2363082-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.268576S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"102","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"6924762","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6924763,"authors":[{"name":"Chien-Chun Cheng","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, SUP\u00c9LEC, Plateau de Moulon, Gif sur Yvette, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6979302/6924763/cheng-2363097-small.gif","p":["\nChien-Chun Cheng (S'11) received the B.S. degree in mechanical\nengineering and the M.S. degree in communication engineering from National Central University (NCU), Zhongli, Taiwan, in\n2005 and 2007, respectively.

One practical approach is the interference rejection combining (IRC) scheme, which is already being considered as the base receiver for next-generation 3GPP specifications. IRC treats interference as a stationary Gaussian process to facilitate simple interference suppression. However, this stationary assumption does not hold in practice; for example, the variances of the pilot signal and of the data signal from the interfering base station (eNB) are quite different. This considerably impacts the possible improvements of an interference-aware receiver. In this paper, novel interference suppression schemes are proposed, which handle separately the interfering pilot and the interfering data signals. The proposed schemes take into account channel estimation errors and the errors in estimating the covariance of interference plus noise. The performance of the proposed schemes is validated by using realistic channel models and asynchronous scenarios for MIMO-OFDM systems.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2363097","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6979302/06924763.pdf","startPage":"7086","endPage":"7097","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2363097","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979302","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Interference Suppression With Covariance Mismatches in MIMO-OFDM Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924763","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924763/","displayDocTitle":"Linear Interference Suppression With Covariance Mismatches in MIMO-OFDM Systems","volume":"13","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824362","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924763/","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Interference Suppression With Covariance Mismatches in MIMO-OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-cheng-2363097-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093652S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6979302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6979302","articleId":"6924763","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6924771,"authors":[{"name":"Kukhyun Ahn","affiliation":["Department of Mechanical Engineering, Research and Advanced Engineering, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7268796/6924771/ahn-2363144-small.gif","p":["\nKukhyun Ahn received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in mechanical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2000, 2002, and 2007, respectively.","He was a research faculty member with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, and a Visiting Researcher with General Motors Global R&D, Warren, MI, before joining Research and Advanced Engineering, Ford Motor Company, Dearborn, MI.

This adaptation is driven by the interference and transmit power constraints imposed on the secondary transmitter (STx). Its performance also depends on the quality of channel state information (CSI) available at the STx of the links from the STx to the secondary receiver and to the PRxs. For a system in which an STx is subject to an average interference constraint or an interference outage probability constraint at each of the PRxs, we derive novel symbol error probability (SEP)-optimal, practically motivated binary transmit power control policies. As a reference, we also present the corresponding SEP-optimal continuous transmit power control policies for one PRx. We then analyze the robustness of the optimal policies when the STx knows noisy channel estimates of the links between the SU and the PRxs. Altogether, our work develops a holistic understanding of the critical role played by different transmit and interference constraints in driving power control in underlay CR and the impact of CSI on its performance.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363179","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6960951/06924772.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363179","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960951","startPage":"3753","endPage":"3764","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal Binary Power Control for Underlay CR With Different Interference Constraints and Impact of Channel Estimation Errors","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal Binary Power Control for Underlay CR With Different Interference Constraints and Impact of Channel Estimation Errors","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"62","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14758908","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6924772/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"ANRC"},{"fundingName":"Broadcom Foundation, USA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal Binary Power Control for Underlay CR With Different Interference Constraints and Impact of Channel Estimation Errors","sourcePdf":"tcomm-kashyap-2363179-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.091872S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6960951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6960951","articleId":"6924772","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6924775,"authors":[{"name":"Xingang Fu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7206790/6924775/fu-2361267-small.gif","p":["Xingang Fu (S\u201914) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in applied mathematics from the Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China, in 2005 and 2009, respectively.

To successfully and efficiently train an RNN using the LM algorithm, a new forward accumulation through time (FATT) algorithm is proposed to calculate the Jacobian matrix required by the LM algorithm. This paper explores how to incorporate FATT into the LM algorithm. The results show that the combination of the LM and FATT algorithms trains RNNs better than the conventional backpropagation through time algorithm. This paper presents an analytical study on the optimal control of GCCs, including theoretically ideal optimal and suboptimal controllers. To overcome the inapplicability of the optimal GCC controller under practical conditions, a new RNN controller with an improved input structure is proposed to approximate the ideal optimal controller. The performance of an ideal optimal controller and a well-trained RNN controller was compared in close to real-life power converter switching environments, demonstrating that the proposed RNN controller can achieve close to ideal optimal control performance even under low sampling rate conditions. The excellent performance of the proposed RNN controller under challenging and distorted system conditions further indicates the feasibility of using an RNN to approximate optimal control in practical applications.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2361267","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7206790/06924775.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2361267","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206790","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Training Recurrent Neural Networks With the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt Algorithm for Optimal Control of a Grid-Connected Converter","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924775","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Training Recurrent Neural Networks With the Levenberg\u2013Marquardt Algorithm for Optimal Control of a Grid-Connected Converter","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924775/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"26","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15414238","pubMedId":"25330496","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6924775/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"EECS-1102038 and 1102159"},{"fundingName":"Mary K.

In our framework, SUs demand a different amount of spectrum for their transmissions. Each PO provides a portion of radio resources for leasing and also offers its own primary users (PUs) a certain degree of quality of service (QoS). Furthermore, POs are allowed to have different spectrum trading areas and as well as heterogeneous activities between POs' users. We propose a Two-stage resource allocation scheme with combinatorial Auction and Stackelberg Game in spectrum Sharing (TAGS) to deal with the allocation problem in such a complicated system. In the first stage, a spectrum allocation is decided by running a geographically restricted combinatorial auction without the consideration of spectrum recall. In the second stage, a Stackelberg game is formulated for all users to determine their best strategies with respect to the potential spectrum recall. Both theoretical and simulation results prove that TAGS provides a feasible solution for the problem and ensures the desired economic properties for all individuals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two-Stage Spectrum Sharing With Combinatorial Auction and Stackelberg Game in Recall-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363116","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6960951/06924778.pdf","startPage":"3740","endPage":"3752","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363116","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960951","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924778","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924778/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Two-Stage Spectrum Sharing With Combinatorial Auction and Stackelberg Game in Recall-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6924778/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14758922","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000038","fundingName":"Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Two-Stage Spectrum Sharing With Combinatorial Auction and Stackelberg Game in Recall-Based Cognitive Radio Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-cai-2363116-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102069S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6960951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"66","xplore-issue":"6960951","articleId":"6924778","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6924780,"authors":[{"name":"Mathilde Brandon","affiliation":["ENSEA, ETIS laboratory, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Mathilde","lastName":"Brandon","id":"37945754500"},{"name":"Myriam Ariaudo","affiliation":["ENSEA, ETIS laboratory, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Myriam","lastName":"Ariaudo","id":"37268253200"},{"name":"Sylvain Traverso","affiliation":["THALES Communications and Security, Gennevilliers Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Sylvain","lastName":"Traverso","id":"37581210900"},{"name":"Jessica Bouvier","affiliation":["THALES Communications and Security, Gennevilliers Cedex, France"],"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Bouvier","id":"37948092000"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Gautier","affiliation":["ENSEA, ETIS laboratory, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Gautier","id":"37277497800"},{"name":"Inbar Fijalkow","affiliation":["ENSEA, ETIS laboratory, Cergy, France"],"firstName":"Inbar","lastName":"Fijalkow","id":"37269104600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1531-1309"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-1764"}],"articleNumber":"6924780","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":644},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Microwave Theory and Techniques Society","url":"http://www.mtt.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924780","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linearity","Predistortion","Gallium nitride","Wireless communication","Bit error rate","OFDM","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high power amplifier","PA","predistortion","envelope tracking","efficiency improvement","linearity improvement","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signal","dynamic OFDM signal","simulated power range","GaN"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Digital predistortion (DPD)","efficiency","envelope tracking (ET)","in-band and out-of-band linearity performance","multicarriers signal"]}],"abstract":"This letter presents the optimized way to combine predistortion and envelope tracking to improve at the same time the linearity and efficiency performances of an emitter.

For this reason, the access point (AP) has to not only identify the users who transmitted but also decode the received data codewords. Exploiting the sparsity of transmitting users, Lasso, which is a well-known practical compressed sensing algorithm, is applied for efficient user identification. The compressed sensing algorithm enables the AP to handle more users than the conventional random multiple access schemes do. We develop distributed scheduling methods for maximizing the system sum throughput, and we analyze the corresponding optimal throughput for three different cases of channel knowledge, i.e., the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), the channel state information at the receiver (CSIR), and the imperfect channel state information at the receiver (ImCSIR).

This technology relies on the modulation of backscattered signals, i.e., backscatter modulation, from multiple tags present in the environment. The detection of multiple tags based on backscattered signals is challenging in harsh environments with nonideal conditions such as clutter, near-far interference effects, and clock drift. This paper analyzes the detection of multiple tags employing UWB backscatter modulation and proposes practical signaling, spreading codes, and detection schemes that are robust to nonideal conditions. A case study is presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed technique for the detection of multiple tags based on impulsive backscattered signals.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363118","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6960951/06924791.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363118","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","startPage":"3918","endPage":"3930","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of Multiple Tags Based on Impulsive Backscattered Signals","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924791","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Detection of Multiple Tags Based on Impulsive Backscattered Signals","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924791/","volume":"62","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/6924791/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14758914","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission","grantNumber":"257544"},{"fundingName":"Italian Ministerial PRIN","grantNumber":"2010WHY5PR"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of Multiple Tags Based on Impulsive Backscattered Signals","sourcePdf":"tcomm-guidi-2363118-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121973S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6960951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6960951","articleId":"6924791","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6924792,"authors":[{"name":"Yongpeng Wu","affiliation":["National Mobile Communications Research Laboratory, Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/7035161/6924792/wu-2363105-small.gif","p":["\nYongpeng Wu (S'08\u2013M'13) received the B.S. degree in \ntelecommunication engineering from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2007 and the Ph.D. degree in communication and \nsignal processing from Southeast University, Nanjing, China, in 2013.","He is currently a Humboldt Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the Institute for Digital Communications, \nUniversit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Erlangen, Germany.

We assume that statistical channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitters and consider the problem under the practical finite alphabet input assumption. First, we derive an asymptotic (in the large system limit) expression for the weighted sum rate (WSR) of the MIMO MAC with finite alphabet inputs and Weichselberger's MIMO channel model. Subsequently, we obtain the optimal structures of the linear precoders of the users maximizing the asymptotic WSR and an iterative algorithm for determining the precoders. We show that the complexity of the proposed precoder design is significantly lower than that of MIMO MAC precoders designed for finite alphabet inputs and instantaneous CSI. Simulation results for finite alphabet signaling indicate that the proposed precoder achieves significant performance gains over existing precoder designs.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2363105","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7035161/06924792.pdf","startPage":"983","endPage":"997","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7035161","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2363105","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Linear Precoding for the MIMO Multiple Access Channel With Finite Alphabet Inputs and Statistical CSI","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Linear Precoding for the MIMO Multiple Access Channel With Finite Alphabet Inputs and Statistical CSI","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924792/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14914664","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924792/","volume":"14","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100005156","fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61320106003 and 61222102"},{"fundingName":"China High-Tech 863 Plan","grantNumber":"2012AA01A506"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2013ZX03003004 and 2014ZX03003006-003"},{"fundingName":"Jiangsu Innovation Team"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan","grantNumber":"MOST103-2221-E-110-029-MY3"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0915846 and ECCS-1231848"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Linear Precoding for the MIMO Multiple Access Channel With Finite Alphabet Inputs and Statistical CSI","sourcePdf":"twc-wu-2363105-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.251105S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7035161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7035161","articleId":"6924792","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6924793,"authors":[{"name":"Guanding Yu","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Electronic Engineering, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6960951/6924793/yu-2363092_print-small.gif","p":["\nGuanding Yu (S'05\u2013M'07\u2013SM'13) received the B.E. and Ph.D.\ndegrees in communication engineering from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, in 2001 and 2006, respectively.

Three communication modes are considered for D2D users: cellular mode, dedicated mode, and reuse mode. The optimization problem could be decomposed into two subproblems: power control and joint mode selection and channel assignment. The joint mode selection and channel assignment problem is NP-hard, whose optimal solution can be found by the branch-and-bound method, but is very complicated. Therefore, we develop low-complexity algorithms according to the network load. Through comparing different algorithms under different network loads, proximity gain, hop gain, and reuse gain could be demonstrated in D2D communications.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363092","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363092","startPage":"3814","endPage":"3824","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6960951/06924793.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960951","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Mode Selection and Resource Allocation for Device-to-Device Communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924793/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Joint Mode Selection and Resource Allocation for Device-to-Device Communications","volume":"62","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","accessionNumber":"14758917","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6924793/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Hi-Tech R&D Program","grantNumber":"2014AA01A702"},{"fundingName":"Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation","grantNumber":"LY14F010011"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"1247545 and 1405116"},{"fundingName":"National Science and Technology Major Project of China","grantNumber":"2012ZX03003013-005"},{"fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation Program of China","grantNumber":"61301143"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Mode Selection and Resource Allocation for Device-to-Device Communications","sourcePdf":"tcomm-yu-2363092-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09264S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6960951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"217","xplore-issue":"6960951","articleId":"6924793","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6924795,"authors":[{"name":"Mithat C.

Maintaining the paradigm of deterministic Boolean computing therefore becomes increasingly challenging. Stochastic computing (SC) processes digital data in the form of long pseudo-random bit-streams denoting probabilities and is therefore less vulnerable to uncertainty. When transient circuit variations are present, SC greatly outperforms classical binary implementations. Under these circumstances, it is impossible for binary systems to achieve arbitrarily low error rates, while SC can still trade-off precision for energy by using longer bit-streams. This makes the technique a valuable alternative to binary logic in emerging technologies with high inherent transient uncertainty. This paper assesses the feasibility of multi-stage SC and discusses energy and accuracy considerations in SC design. First, the basics of SC-circuit design are discussed. Second, we investigate three different sources of noise or uncertainty and assess their impact on SC accuracy. Third, we propose a methodological design strategy to evaluate the accuracy of general, multi-stage SC systems. The validity of this new approach is illustrated through the design of a 1D-DCT stochastic circuit, as part of a JPEG compression accelerator. Our analysis shows multi-stage stochastic computing requires very long word lengths to achieve high accuracy, resulting in low energy efficiency. Exploiting stochastic computing's transient error tolerance in emerging technologies will thus have a high energy cost.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924798/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14810746","htmlLink":"/document/6924798/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"4","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficiency and Accuracy of Stochastic Computing Circuits in Emerging Technologies","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficiency and Accuracy of Stochastic Computing Circuits in Emerging Technologies","sourcePdf":"jetcas-moons-2361070-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070245S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"6970761","articleId":"6924798","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6924800,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Mei","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7206790/6924800/mei-2359955-small.gif","p":["Jie Mei received the B.S. degree in information and computational science from Jilin University, Changchun, China, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree in control science and engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2011.","He was an exchange Ph.D. student supported by the China Scholarship Council with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Utah State University, Logan, UT, USA, from 2009 to 2011.

More specifically, we focus on multiple second-order nonlinear systems and networked Lagrangian systems. We first study the distributed containment control problem for multiple second-order nonlinear systems with multiple dynamic leaders in the presence of unknown nonlinearities and external disturbances under a general directed graph that characterizes the interaction among the leaders and the followers. A distributed adaptive control algorithm with an adaptive gain design based on the approximation capability of neural networks is proposed. We present a necessary and sufficient condition on the directed graph such that the containment error can be reduced as small as desired. As a byproduct, the leaderless consensus problem is solved with asymptotical convergence. Because relative velocity measurements between neighbors are generally more difficult to obtain than relative position measurements, we then propose a distributed containment control algorithm without using neighbors' velocity information. A two-step Lyapunov-based method is used to study the convergence of the closed-loop system. Next, we apply the ideas to deal with the containment control problem for networked unknown Lagrangian systems under a general directed graph. All the proposed algorithms are distributed and can be implemented using only local measurements in the absence of communication. Finally, simulation examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms.","doi":"10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2359955","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5962385/7206790/06924800.pdf","startPage":"1885","endPage":"1899","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7206790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2014.2359955","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Distributed Containment Control for Multiple Unknown Second-Order Nonlinear Systems With Application to Networked Lagrangian Systems","volume":"26","issue":"9","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924800/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15414256","pubMedId":"25330495","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924800/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"ECCS-1213295 and ECCS-1307678"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61174200, 61403094 and 61120106010"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"S2012040007301"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002858","fundingName":"China Post-Doctoral Science Foundation","grantNumber":"2012M520737 and 2014T70338"},{"fundingName":"Foundation Research Project of Shenzhen","grantNumber":"JCYJ20120613115259889"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed Containment Control for Multiple Unknown Second-Order Nonlinear Systems With Application to Networked Lagrangian Systems","sourcePdf":"tnnls-ren-2359955-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115728S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"5962385","isNumber":"7206790","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5962385","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"7206790","articleId":"6924800","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6924802,"authors":[{"name":"Yahia A.

Since different subcarriers see different channel gains in frequency-selective channels, the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) of the codeword must be selected based on the vector of signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) of these subcarriers. Exponential effective SNR mapping (EESM) maps the vector of SNRs into an equivalent flat-fading SNR, and is widely used to simplify this problem. We develop a new analytical framework to characterize the throughput of EESM-based rate adaptation in such wideband channels in the presence of feedback delays. We derive a novel accurate approximation for the throughput as a function of feedback delay. We also propose a novel bivariate gamma distribution to model the time evolution of EESM between the times of estimation and data transmission, which facilitates the analysis. These are then generalized to a multi-cell, multi-user scenario with various frequency-domain schedulers. Unlike prior work, most of which is simulation-based, our framework encompasses both correlated and independent subcarriers and various multiple antenna diversity modes; it is accurate over a wide range of delays.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924803/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6924803/","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914653","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing the Impact of Feedback Delays on Wideband Rate Adaptation","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Broadcom Foundation, USA"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing the Impact of Feedback Delays on Wideband Rate Adaptation","sourcePdf":"twc-francis-2363083-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.120798S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7035161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"7035161","articleId":"6924803","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6924808,"authors":[{"name":"Veeresh Hongal","affiliation":["Intel Corporation, Sacramento, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5503868/6970761/6924808/6924808-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Veeresh Hongal received the M.S. degree in computer engineering from Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO, USA.","He is currently working as a CAD Engineer at Intel Corporation.

Potential technical merits of the proposed MLUT architecture includes: 1) better manufacturability due to structural simplicity and regularity; 2) improved robustness over PVT (process-voltage-temperature) variations; 3) event-driven low-power/noise asynchronous operation; and 4) encoding-level logic inversion. In spite of having numerous merits over the clocked counterparts and previous asynchronous designs, it is bound to have inevitable defects and faults due to nondeterministic and unconventional nanoscale assembly and operation. In order to overcome defect issues in the proposed MLUT-based nanoscale asynchronous crossbar architecture, there is a need to develop efficient design, test, and repair techniques. Typical approach so far has been to test every crosspoint on each crossbar MLUT exhaustively; this is not only laborious but is also prohibitively time and space consuming for designs involving large number of MLUTs. This paper introduces a novel testing scheme based on \u201cDivide and Conquer\u201d approach to efficiently locate the defective memristors in a MLUT. The proposed testing scheme leverages upon a special current additive property of the memristor-based multiplexer. It performs binary isolation of regions, reducing the search space by half whenever applicable. Numerical simulations clearly demonstrate that the approach is generic, deterministic, and scalable. A faster MLUT programming technique and a repair technique utilizing partially defective MLUTs are also proposed and extensively validated through parametric simulations.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924808/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924808/","dateOfInsertion":"09 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14810749","volume":"4","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Design, Test, and Repair of MLUT (Memristor Look-Up Table) Based Asynchronous Nanowire Reconfigurable Crossbar Architecture","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design, Test, and Repair of MLUT (Memristor Look-Up Table) Based Asynchronous Nanowire Reconfigurable Crossbar Architecture","sourcePdf":"jetcas-choi-2361067-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.076832S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6970761","articleId":"6924808","onlineDate":"15 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6924813,"authors":[{"name":"Chiou-Yng Lee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Information and Network Engineering, Lunghwa University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/6936397/6924813/6924813-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chiou-Yng Lee received the Bachelor's degree (1986) in medical engineering and the M.S. degree in electronic engineering (1992), both from the Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Chang Gung University, Taiwan, in 2001.","From 1988 to 2005, he was a Research Associate with Chunghwa Telecommunication Laboratory, Taiwan.

The transform filter coefficients are first mapped by algebraic integers, and then quantized using a subband coding algorithm. The performance of the algorithm is assessed by using several benchmark images and the results are compared in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and bit rate. The architecture of both D4 and D6 is implemented on field programmable gate array (FPGA). The results show that the proposed AIQ-based implementations perform better and consume fewer resources than similar other lifting-based techniques.","doi":"10.1109/CJECE.2014.2316227","publicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"Canadian Journal of Electrical and Computer Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel7/9754/6924841/06924846.pdf","startPage":"127","endPage":"134","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CJECE.2014.2316227","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924841","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Efficient Algorithm for Daubechies Lifting Wavelets Using Algebraic Integers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924846","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Summer  2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Summer  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924846/","displayDocTitle":"An Efficient Algorithm for Daubechies Lifting Wavelets Using Algebraic Integers","volume":"37","issue":"3","publicationDate":"Summer 2014","accessionNumber":"14665399","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924846/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Grand Challenges Canada Star in Global Health"},{"fundingName":"Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000196","fundingName":"Canada Foundation for Innovation"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Efficient Algorithm for Daubechies Lifting Wavelets Using Algebraic Integers","sourcePdf":"cjece-wahid-2316227-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06181S","chronDate":"Summer  2014","xplore-pub-id":"9754","isNumber":"6924841","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9754","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6924841","articleId":"6924846","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6924849,"authors":[{"name":"Rocco Di Taranto","affiliation":["Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden"],"bio":{"p":["Rocco Di Taranto (taranto@chalmers.se) received the Laurea in Ingegneria delle Telecomunicazioni from Politecnico di Torino in 2005 and the Ph.D. degree in wireless communications from Aalborg University in 2010.

With each generation of cellular networks, we have moved closer to this wireless dream; first by delivering wireless access to voice communications, then by providing wireless data services, and recently by delivering a Wi-Fi-like experience with wide-area coverage and user mobility management. The support for high data rates has been the main objective in recent years [1], as seen from the academic focus on sum-rate optimization and the efforts from standardization bodies to meet the peak rate requirements specified in IMT-Advanced. In contrast, a variety of metrics/objectives are put forward in the technological preparations for fifth-generation (5G) networks: higher peak rates, improved coverage with uniform user experience, higher reliability and lower latency, better energy efficiency (EE), lower-cost user devices and services, better scalability with number of devices, etc. These multiple objectives are coupled, often in a conflicting manner such that improvements in one objective lead to degradation in the other objectives. Hence, the design of future networks calls for new optimization tools that properly handle the existence of multiple objectives and tradeoffs between them.","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2014.2330661","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2014.2330661","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/6923515/06924852.pdf","startPage":"14","endPage":"23","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiobjective Signal Processing Optimization: The way to balance conflicting metrics in 5G systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Multiobjective Signal Processing Optimization: The way to balance conflicting metrics in 5G systems","volume":"31","issue":"6","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6924852/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665312","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924852/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiobjective Signal Processing Optimization: The way to balance conflicting metrics in 5G systems","sourcePdf":"31msp06-bjornson-2330661-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099419S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6923515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"127","xplore-issue":"6923515","articleId":"6924852","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6924853,"authors":[{"name":"Renato L.

With a drastic increase of infrastructure nodes (e.g. ultradense deployment of small cells), the total energy consumption may easily exceed an acceptable level. While most studies focus on the energy radiated by the antennas, the bigger part of the total energy budget is actually consumed by the hardware (e.g., coolers and circuit energy consumption). The ability to shut down infrastructure nodes (or parts of it) or to adapt the transmission strategy according to the traffic will therefore become an important design aspect of energy-efficient wireless ?architectures. Network infrastructure should be ?regarded as a resource that can be occupied or released on demand, and the modeling and optimization of such systems are highly nontrivial problems. In particular, elements of the network infrastructure should be released by taking into account traffic forecasts to avoid losing the required coverage and capacity. However, even if traffic profiles were perfectly known, the determination of the elements to be released is complicated by the potential interference coupling between active elements and the sheer size of the optimization problems in dense networks.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Toward Energy-Efficient 5G Wireless Communications Technologies: Tools for decoupling the scaling of networks from the growth of operating power","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","doi":"10.1109/MSP.2014.2335093","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Magazine","pdfPath":"/iel7/79/6923515/06924853.pdf","startPage":"24","endPage":"34","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MSP.2014.2335093","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6923515","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6924853","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6924853/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"15 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Toward Energy-Efficient 5G Wireless Communications Technologies: Tools for decoupling the scaling of networks from the growth of operating power","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"31","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6924853/","dateOfInsertion":"15 October 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14665318","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward Energy-Efficient 5G Wireless Communications Technologies: Tools for decoupling the scaling of networks from the growth of operating power","sourcePdf":"31msp06-cavalcante-2335093-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.105624S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"79","isNumber":"6923515","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"79","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6923515","articleId":"6924853","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-06"},{"_id":6925191,"authors":[{"name":"Amr Abdullah A.

Further, arc faults in deployed systems are seemingly random and challenging to faithfully create experimentally in the laboratory, which makes the study of arc fault signature detection difficult. While it may seem trivial to simply record arcing signatures from real-world system, an obstacle in capturing these arc signals is that arc faults in the PV systems do not happen predictably, and depending on the location of the sensors relative to the arc location, may contribute a negligible portion to the magnitude of the sensed current or voltage waveform. The high-frequency content of the arc requires fast sampling, long memory, and fast processing to acquire, store, and analyze the waveforms; this adds substantial balance-of-system cost when considering widespread deployment of arc fault detectors in PV applications. In this paper, we study the performance of the fast Fourier transform arc detection method compared to the wavelet decomposition method by using synthetic waveforms. These waveforms are created by combining measured waveforms of normal background noise from inverters in DC PV arrays along with waveforms of arcing events. Using this technique allows the ratio of amplitudes are varied. Combining these separate waveforms in various amplitude proportions enables creation of test signals for the study of detection algorithm efficacy. It will be shown that the wavelet transformation technique produce more easily recognized detection results and can perform this detection using a much lower sampling rate than what is required for the fast Fourier transform.","doi":"10.1109/PVSC.2014.6925625","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 40th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 40th Photovoltaic Specialist Conference (PVSC)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6912652/6924865/06925625.pdf","startPage":"3239","endPage":"3244","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/PVSC.2014.6925625","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6924865","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Arc fault signal detection - Fourier transformation vs. wavelet decomposition techniques using synthesized data","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6925625","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-13 June 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925625/","displayDocTitle":"Arc fault signal detection - Fourier transformation vs. wavelet decomposition techniques using synthesized data","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14683858","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6925625/","conferenceDate":"8-13 June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Arc fault signal detection - Fourier transformation vs. wavelet decomposition techniques using synthesized data","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"917.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07857S","chronDate":"8-13 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6912652","isNumber":"6924865","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6912652","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6924865","articleId":"6925625","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6925643,"authors":[{"name":"Fa-Jun Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fa-Jun","lastName":"Ma","id":"37397780200"},{"name":"Ziv Hameiri","affiliation":["School of Photovoltaic and Renewable Energy Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, Australia","Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Ziv","lastName":"Hameiri","id":"37403752100"},{"name":"Ganesh S.

It widens paths in order to span multiple nodes per hop. As a result, groups of nodes cooperate locally at each hop to forward packets. Recent theoretical work suggests using Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) in combination with Corridor-based Routing to improve throughput in WMNs. However, results focus on achievable capacity and do not consider practical issues such as modulation and coding schemes. In this paper, we study OFDMA for corridors in practice and implement it on software-defined radios. We show that OFDMA corridors provide significantly larger throughput gains when considering realistic modulation and coding, achieving up to 2x throughput gain compared to traditional routing not based on corridors.","displayPublicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916486/6925725/06925750.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"9","publicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2014.6925750","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2014.6925750","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925725","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6925750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Practical OFDMA for corridor-based routing in Wireless Multihop Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Modulation","Routing","Transmitters","Bit error rate","Receivers","Resource management","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency division multiple access","network coding","software radio","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["corridor-based routing","wireless multihop networks","WMN","physical layer scheme","orthogonal frequency-division multiple access","OFDMA","network throughput","software defined radio","network coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wireless multihop","corridor-based routing","ofdma"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925750/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Practical OFDMA for corridor-based routing in Wireless Multihop Networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6925750/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14684738","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Practical OFDMA for corridor-based routing in Wireless Multihop Networks","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p1loch.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066993S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916486","isNumber":"6925725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916486","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6925725","articleId":"6925750","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6925773,"authors":[{"name":"Yogita Chapre","affiliation":["Networks Research Group, NICTA, Sydney, Australia","School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Yogita","lastName":"Chapre","id":"37847957000"},{"name":"Aleksandar Ignjatovic","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Ignjatovic","id":"37326895100"},{"name":"Aruna Seneviratne","affiliation":["Networks Research Group, NICTA, Sydney, Australia","School of Electrical Engineering & Telecommunications, University of New South Wales, Australia"],"firstName":"Aruna","lastName":"Seneviratne","id":"37271673100"},{"name":"Sanjay Jha","affiliation":["School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Jha","id":"37279267200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3780-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3778-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6925773","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":57,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":4134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Accuracy","MIMO","Training","Frequency diversity","Receiving antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","indoor radio","MIMO communication","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CSI-MIMO","indoor Wi-Fi fingerprinting system","received signal strength indicator","RSSI","environmental effects","hardware effects","channel state information","multiple input multiple output information","k-nearest neighbor","Bayes algorithm","finegrained indoor fingerprinting system"]}],"abstract":"Wi-Fi based fingerprinting systems, mostly utilize the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), which is known to be unreliable due to environmental and hardware effects.

Since no power models for home gateways are currently available, the optimization of their power state is not possible. This paper presents PowerPi, a power consumption model for the Raspberry Pi which is used as a substitute to conventional home gateways to derive the impact of typical hardware components on the energy consumption. The different power states of the platform are measured and a power model is derived, allowing to estimate the power consumption based on CPU and network utilization only. The proposed power model estimates the power consumption resulting in a RMSE of less than 3.3%, which is slightly larger than the maximum error of the measurements of 2.5%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power demand","Power measurement","Voltage measurement","Monitoring","Bandwidth","Current measurement","Software measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy conservation","home networks","Internet","internetworking","low-power electronics","microcomputers","power aware computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PowerPi","power consumption measurement","power consumption modeling","Raspberry Pi","Internet","DSL","cable","home gateways","energy efficiency improvements","power state optimization","energy consumption","CPU","network utilization"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925725","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2014.6925777","startPage":"236","endPage":"243","publicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916486/6925725/06925777.pdf","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2014.6925777","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PowerPi: Measuring and modeling the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"PowerPi: Measuring and modeling the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14684689","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6925777/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925777/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PowerPi: Measuring and modeling the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p236kaup.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06814S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916486","isNumber":"6925725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916486","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6925725","articleId":"6925777","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6925785,"authors":[{"name":"Sven Hager","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Group, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Sven","lastName":"Hager","id":"37085438707"},{"name":"Frank Winkler","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Group, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Winkler","id":"37373909200"},{"name":"Bj\u00f6rn Scheuermann","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Group, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Bj\u00f6rn","lastName":"Scheuermann","id":"37297044500"},{"name":"Klaus Reinhardt","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Group, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany"],"firstName":"Klaus","lastName":"Reinhardt","id":"37085438947"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3780-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3778-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6925785","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":447},"abstract":"The process of matching the header fields of network packets against a set of rules is a performance critical task of firewalls.

By adapting the implemented logic to the specific firewall ruleset, FPGAs allow for much more specifically tailored and thus more efficient processing than ruleset-independent circuits in an ASIC. We present MPFC, a method to generate customized firewall circuits in the form of synthesizable VHDL code for FPGA configuration.

With some nodes employed as relays, the throughput of such networks is enhanced through cooperative gains. In this paper, we address the problem of maximizing the throughput of an underlay cognitive network through optimal power allocation of non-orthogonal amplify-and-forward relays. In order to maintain stable communication at the primary network, the interference due to the activities of all the cognitive nodes is kept below a limit. The optimal power allocation problem is formulated and then transformed to a quadratically constrained quadratic problem (QCQP). The maximum throughput of the cognitive network is derived as an eigen-solution of a channel-dependent matrix and the corresponding signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is shown to be the dominant eigenvalue of this matrix. The proposed power allocation achieves significant throughput improvement over equal power allocation scheme and opportunistic relay selection scheme.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2014.6925804","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925725","startPage":"410","endPage":"413","displayPublicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916486/6925725/06925804.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal power allocation in cognitive networks using non-orthogonal AF relays","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925804/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6925804/","displayDocTitle":"Optimal power allocation in cognitive networks using non-orthogonal AF relays","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14684722","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal power allocation in cognitive networks using non-orthogonal AF relays","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p410elsaadany.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043222S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916486","isNumber":"6925725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916486","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6925725","articleId":"6925804","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6925806,"authors":[{"name":"Ioan Sorin Com\u015fa","affiliation":["University of Bedfordshire, Luton, Luton, GB"],"firstName":"Ioan Sorin","lastName":"Com\u015fa"},{"name":"Mehmet Aydin","affiliation":["Institute for Research in Applicable Computing, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Mehmet","lastName":"Aydin","id":"37576069400"},{"name":"Sijing Zhang","affiliation":["Institute for Research in Applicable Computing, University of Bedfordshire, Luton, United Kingdom"],"firstName":"Sijing","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38238864500"},{"name":"Pierre Kuonen","affiliation":["Institute for Complex Systems, University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Pierre","lastName":"Kuonen","id":"37299789100"},{"name":"Jean-Frederic Wagen","affiliation":["Institute for Complex Systems, University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Jean-Frederic","lastName":"Wagen","id":"37344265400"},{"name":"Yao Lu","affiliation":["Institute for Complex Systems, University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland, Fribourg, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Yao","lastName":"Lu","id":"37085342327"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3780-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3778-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6925806","dbTime":"24 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":708},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Throughput","Dynamic scheduling","Approximation algorithms","Linear programming","Heuristic algorithms","Optimization","Telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","convergence","intelligent control","learning (artificial intelligence)","learning automata","Long Term Evolution","Markov processes","multilayer perceptrons","nonlinear functions","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["GPF parameters optimal policy","dynamic radio environment","optimal fairness condition","convergence speed","CACLA RL algorithm","continuous actor-critic learning automata","MDP","Markov decision process","reinforcement learning principle","intelligent controller","LTE scheduler behavior","MLPNN nonlinear function","multidimensional scheduler state","multilayer perceptron neural network","GPF scheduling rule","generalized proportional fair","TTI","transmission time interval","LTE-A cellular network","fairness tradeoff control","dynamic cell throughput","scheduling policy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LTE-A","TTI","CQI","throughput","fairness","scheduling rule","policy","MLPNN","RL","MDP","CACLA"]}],"abstract":"In LTE-A cellular networks there is a fundamental trade-off between the cell throughput and fairness levels for preselected users which are sharing the same amount of resources at one transmission time interval (TTI). The static parameterization of the Generalized Proportional Fair (GPF) scheduling rule is not able to maintain a satisfactory level of fairness at each TTI when a very dynamic radio environment is considered. The novelty of the current paper aims to find the optimal policy of GPF parameters in order to respect the fairness criterion. From sustainability reasons, the multi-layer perceptron neural network (MLPNN) is used to map at each TTI the continuous and multidimensional scheduler state into a desired GPF parameter. The MLPNN non-linear function is trained TTI-by-TTI based on the interaction between LTE scheduler and the proposed intelligent controller. The interaction is modeled by using the reinforcement learning (RL) principle in which the LTE scheduler behavior is modeled based on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) property. The continuous actor-critic learning automata (CACLA) RL algorithm is proposed to select at each TTI the continuous and optimal GPF parameter for a given MDP problem. The results indicate that CACLA enhances the convergence speed to the optimal fairness condition when compared with other existing methods by minimizing in the same time the number of TTIs when the scheduler is declared unfair.","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2014.6925806","publicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916486/6925725/06925806.pdf","startPage":"418","endPage":"421","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2014.6925806","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925725","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling policies based on dynamic throughput and fairness tradeoff control in LTE-A networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6925806","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925806/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling policies based on dynamic throughput and fairness tradeoff control in LTE-A networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14684702","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6925806/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling policies based on dynamic throughput and fairness tradeoff control in LTE-A networks","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p418comsa.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09086S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916486","isNumber":"6925725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916486","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6925725","articleId":"6925806","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6925810,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammad Naghibi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Naghibi","id":"37085528392"},{"name":"Majid Ghaderi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Calgary"],"firstName":"Majid","lastName":"Ghaderi","id":"37274408700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3780-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3778-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0742-1303"}],"articleNumber":"6925810","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":836},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Array signal processing","Throughput","Portable computers","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Servers","Interference","Wireless communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","computer network performance evaluation","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WiFi access point beamforming","live measurement","throughput performance","single expensive beamforming","multiple low cost omnidirectional access point"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterizing the performance of beamforming WiFi access points","doi":"10.1109/LCN.2014.6925810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925725","endPage":"437","publicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","displayPublicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916486/6925725/06925810.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCN.2014.6925810","startPage":"434","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6925810","abstract":"Recently beamforming WiFi access points (APs) have been commercially available from multiple vendors. The promise of beamforming APs is the enhanced range and data transmission rate, albeit at a premium price for the AP which can be an order of magnitude more expensive than regular omnidirectional APs. In this work, through live measurements, we study the throughput performance of beamforming APs and compare it with that of regular omnidirectional APs. We consider two systems with multiple WiFi clients and: 1) a single expensive beamforming AP, and 2) multiple low-cost omnidirectional APs. We find that while in some situations the beamforming AP outperforms multiple regular APs when downloading data, in other scenarios typical of home and office use, multiple regular APs results in higher throughput and service quality. Moreover, multiple regular APs always outperforms the beamforming AP when uploading data.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925810/","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14684739","htmlLink":"/document/6925810/","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Characterizing the performance of beamforming WiFi access points","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterizing the performance of beamforming WiFi access points","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p434naghibi.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066362S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916486","isNumber":"6925725","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916486","xplore-issue":"6925725","articleId":"6925810","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6925813,"authors":[{"name":"Kais Elmurtadi Suleiman","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Kais Elmurtadi","lastName":"Suleiman","id":"37085536557"},{"name":"Abd-Elhamid M.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose two hybrid location estimation techniques that combine RSS and TOA in cognitive radio (CR) system.

Finally, the experimental results using average model show a fast response with good agreement of that simulation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925856/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14685082","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6925856/","publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved particle swarm optimization algorithm using average model on MPPT for partial shading in PV array","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved particle swarm optimization algorithm using average model on MPPT for partial shading in PV array","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0039cameraready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054772S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917156","isNumber":"6925830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917156","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6925830","articleId":"6925856","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6925886,"authors":[{"name":"Poompat Saengudomlert","affiliation":["Bangkok University-Center of Research in Optoelectronics, Communications and Control Systems (BU-CROCCS), Thailand"],"firstName":"Poompat","lastName":"Saengudomlert","id":"37269371700"},{"name":"Jariya Panta","affiliation":["Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Thailand"],"firstName":"Jariya","lastName":"Panta","id":"37085336299"},{"name":"Keattisak Sripimanwat","affiliation":["National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC), Thailand"],"firstName":"Keattisak","lastName":"Sripimanwat","id":"37326483600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3174-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6925886","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":197},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Quadrature amplitude modulation","Bit error rate","Tin","Optical receivers","Optimized production technology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandwidth allocation","error statistics","indoor communication","intensity modulation","OFDM modulation","optical communication","quadrature amplitude modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission bit rates","single transmitter","BER","fixed target bit error rate","ACO-OFDM","asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM","DCO-OFDM","DC biased optical OFDM","unipolar OFDM signals","direct detection","intensity modulation","OFDM","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","bandwidth limitation","indoor optical wireless OFDM transmissions","QAM constellation optimal sizing","bit rate 10 Mbit/s","bit rate 20 Mbit/s"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["bit error rate","modulation","optical wireless communications","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing"]}],"abstract":"This paper investigates the performance of indoor optical wireless transmissions using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) with intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD). To obtain unipolar OFDM signals compatible with IM/DD, DC biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) and asymmetrically clipped optical OFDM (ACO-OFDM) are considered with DCO-OFDM as the baseline. Known to be more power efficient, ACO-OFDM is optimized over the size of standard QAM constellations subject to the constraints on a fixed transmission bit rate and on a fixed target bit error rate (BER). However, there is no constraint on the utilized bandwidth; this assumption holds for any room with a single transmitter, e.g., for broadcasting. For the transmission bit rates of 10 and 20 Mbps, using system parameters according to typical operating environments, it is observed that there is an optimal QAM constellation size that is neither the smallest nor the largest.","doi":"10.1109/iEECON.2014.6925886","publicationTitle":"2014 International Electrical Engineering Congress (iEECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Electrical Engineering Congress (iEECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917156/6925830/06925886.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iEECON.2014.6925886","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925830","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal sizing of QAM constellation for indoor optical wireless OFDM transmissions without bandwidth limitation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6925886","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal sizing of QAM constellation for indoor optical wireless OFDM transmissions without bandwidth limitation","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925886/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14685086","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6925886/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal sizing of QAM constellation for indoor optical wireless OFDM transmissions without bandwidth limitation","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"0091cameraready.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055628S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917156","isNumber":"6925830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917156","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6925830","articleId":"6925886","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6925889,"authors":[{"name":"Chatchai Suppitaksakul","affiliation":["Dept.

Results indicate that the proposed method can provide the same H matrix as the PEG algorithm does but with lower complexity.","doi":"10.1109/iEECON.2014.6925956","publicationTitle":"2014 International Electrical Engineering Congress (iEECON)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Electrical Engineering Congress (iEECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917156/6925830/06925956.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iEECON.2014.6925956","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925830","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PEG-like algorithm for LDPC codes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6925956","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PEG-like algorithm for LDPC codes","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925956/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14685047","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6925956/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PEG-like algorithm for LDPC codes","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"CMINV012.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056688S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917156","isNumber":"6925830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917156","xplore-issue":"6925830","articleId":"6925956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6925958,"authors":[{"name":"Akkarat Boonpoonga","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Akkarat","lastName":"Boonpoonga","id":"37294521100"},{"name":"Phaophak Sirisuk","affiliation":["International College"],"firstName":"Phaophak","lastName":"Sirisuk","id":"37283910900"},{"name":"Monai Krairiksh","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Monai","lastName":"Krairiksh","id":"37277884900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3174-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6925958","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":147},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adaptive arrays","Indexes","Arrays","Array signal processing","Prediction algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive antenna arrays","field programmable gate arrays","fixed point arithmetic","floating point arithmetic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA implementation","blind adaptive antenna","adaptive array antenna","constant modulus algorithm","MAC architectures","parallel architectures","CMA processing unit","field programmable gate array","floating-point arithmetic","fixed-point arithmetic","FPGA resource utilization","maximum operating clock frequency"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Constant modulus algorithm (CMA)","implementation","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a review of an adaptive array antenna using a constant modulus algorithm (CMA) in implementation aspect.

However there are many cases in which most of the information covers at some particular components while the rest is worthless. Therefore it is very useful if those significant components can be directly collected instead of wasting bandwidth for the unnecessary ones. Compressive Sensing (CS) is an algorithm that minimizes the sampling rate of the signals while still retaining the necessary information for the reconstruction process. It bypasses the current algorithms in which large amount of data is collected and then remove in a consequent compression step. Every CS algorithms are the combination of random kernels and non parametric estimation techniques. In general, the reconstruction framework estimates an under determined linear system of solutions with an unknown compressible or sparse signals. CS is applied broadly and be a novel algorithm in signal processing including: Channel Coding, Inverse Problem, Data Compression, Data Acquisition and in some fields where hardware has limitation.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 International Electrical Engineering Congress (iEECON)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917156/6925830/06925959.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 International Electrical Engineering Congress (iEECON)","doi":"10.1109/iEECON.2014.6925959","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/iEECON.2014.6925959","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925830","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6925959","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An introduction to compressive sensing for digital signal reconstruction and its implementation on digital image reconstruction","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Inverse problems","Minimization","Image reconstruction","Laplace equations","Image coding","Robustness"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compressed sensing","image reconstruction","image sampling","information theory","signal detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Nyquist theorem","Shannon theorem","Data Compression","inverse problem","channel coding","random kernels","nonparametric estimation techniques","CS algorithms","data acquisition","signal processing","digital image reconstruction","digital signal reconstruction","compressive sensing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Signal Processing","Compressive Sensing","Digital Image Reconstruction","Data Compression","Domain Transformation","Partial Measurement"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925959/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-21 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"An introduction to compressive sensing for digital signal reconstruction and its implementation on digital image reconstruction","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6925959/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14685026","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","conferenceDate":"19-21 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An introduction to compressive sensing for digital signal reconstruction and its implementation on digital image reconstruction","confLoc":"Chonburi, Thailand","sourcePdf":"DSPINV005.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076645S","chronDate":"19-21 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917156","isNumber":"6925830","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917156","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6925830","articleId":"6925959","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6925965,"authors":[{"name":"Naebboon Hoonchareon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand"],"firstName":"Naebboon","lastName":"Hoonchareon","id":"37298620600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3174-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6925965","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":164},"abstract":"Global trend of Smart Grid development has raised the awareness on Research, Development, and Engineering in related areas, in Thailand, so that all concerned parties will be able to apply the technology, efficiently and wisely, to enhancing performance in all parts of our future electrical power grid, and to achieving the goal of renewable energy generation promotion without compromising the security and reliability of the main grid.

Such memory interference delay can be large and highly variable, thereby posing a significant challenge for the design of predictable real-time systems. In this paper, we present techniques to provide a tight upper bound on the worst-case memory interference in a COTS-based multi-core system. We explicitly model the major resources in the DRAM system, including banks, buses and the memory controller. By considering their timing characteristics, we analyze the worst-case memory interference delay imposed on a task by other tasks running in parallel. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work bounding the request re-ordering effect of COTS memory controllers. Our work also enables the quantification of the extent by which memory interference can be reduced by partitioning DRAM banks. We evaluate our approach on a commodity multi-core platform running Linux/RK. Experimental results show that our approach provides an upper bound very close to our measured worst-case interference.","doi":"10.1109/RTAS.2014.6925998","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917167/6925980/06925998.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTAS.2014.6925998","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","startPage":"145","endPage":"154","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Bounding memory interference delay in COTS-based multi-core systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6925998","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"Bounding memory interference delay in COTS-based multi-core systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925998/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6925998/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2014","accessionNumber":"14855170","dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2015","conferenceDate":"15-17 April 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Bounding memory interference delay in COTS-based multi-core systems","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"17199Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.290291S","chronDate":"15-17 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917167","isNumber":"6925980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917167","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"6925980","articleId":"6925998","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6925999,"authors":[{"name":"Heechul Yun","affiliation":["Universityry of Kansas, USA"],"firstName":"Heechul","lastName":"Yun","id":"37085424702"},{"name":"Renato Mancuso","affiliation":["University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA"],"firstName":"Renato","lastName":"Mancuso","id":"37085344669"},{"name":"Zheng-Pei Wu","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Waterloo, ON, CA"],"firstName":"Zheng-Pei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085565289"},{"name":"Rodolfo Pellizzoni","affiliation":["University of Waterloo, Canada"],"firstName":"Rodolfo","lastName":"Pellizzoni","id":"37282693900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4829-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4691-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-3421"}],"articleNumber":"6925999","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":105,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":1475},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6925999","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Multicore processing","Resource management","Hardware","Benchmark testing","Kernel","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","paged storage","shared memory systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PALLOC","DRAM bank-aware memory allocator","performance isolation","commercial off-the-shelf multicore platforms","COTS multicore platforms","memory space","memory performance","shared banks","page-based virtual memory system","memory pages allocation","DRAM bank partitioning"]}],"abstract":"DRAM consists of multiple resources called banks that can be accessed in parallel and independently maintain state information. In Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) multicore platforms, banks are typically shared among all cores, even though programs running on the cores do not share memory space. In this situation, memory performance is highly unpredictable due to contention in the shared banks. In this paper, we propose PALLOC, a DRAM bank-aware memory allocator which exploits the page-based virtual memory system to allocate memory pages of each application to specific banks. With PALLOC, we can dynamically partition banks to avoid bank sharing among cores, thereby improving isolation on COTS multicore platforms without requiring any special hardware support. We performed an extensive set of experiments to investigate the performance impact of DRAM bank partitioning on two COTS multicore platforms with a set of synthetic and SPEC2006 benchmarks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that DRAM bank partitioning significantly improves isolation and real-time performance.","doi":"10.1109/RTAS.2014.6925999","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/RTAS.2014.6925999","startPage":"155","endPage":"166","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 19th Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917167/6925980/06925999.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6925980","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PALLOC: DRAM bank-aware memory allocator for performance isolation on multicore platforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6925999/","conferenceDate":"15-17 April 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"15-17 April 2014","displayDocTitle":"PALLOC: DRAM bank-aware memory allocator for performance isolation on multicore platforms","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"19 January 2015","accessionNumber":"14855154","publicationDate":"April 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6925999/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PALLOC: DRAM bank-aware memory allocator for performance isolation on multicore platforms","confLoc":"Berlin, Germany","sourcePdf":"18212Paper.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09772S","chronDate":"15-17 April 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917167","isNumber":"6925980","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917167","citationCount":"105","xplore-issue":"6925980","articleId":"6925999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6926006,"authors":[{"name":"Sriram Karunagaran","affiliation":["Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, India"],"firstName":"Sriram","lastName":"Karunagaran","id":"37640503300"},{"name":"Karuna P.

Often, building a testbed to test these properties can be challenging and costly. For the first time, this paper proposes a Modular Architecture with Event-driven Synchronization and Time-driven Real-time Operations (MAESTRO) for a low-cost testbed, to support HIL and system testing.

The work addresses this issue by providing 1) a model-driven design path for the specification of the communication infrastructure, 2) a methodology to manipulate the network to generate design alternatives, and 3) a technique to generate models for network simulation. New algorithms have been supported by the development of tools to manipulate network specification efficiently and to generate the simulation model automatically so that network alternatives can be explored effectively.","doi":"10.1109/MTV.2013.22","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MTV.2013.22","startPage":"45","endPage":"51","displayPublicationTitle":"2013 14th International Workshop on Microprocessor Test and Verification","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923034/6926081/06926100.pdf","publicationTitle":"2013 14th International Workshop on Microprocessor Test and Verification","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Communication Alternatives Exploration in Model-Driven Design of Networked Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","displayDocTitle":"Communication Alternatives Exploration in Model-Driven Design of Networked Embedded Systems","conferenceDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2013","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926100/","accessionNumber":"14685716","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926100/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Communication Alternatives Exploration in Model-Driven Design of Networked Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Austin, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"3246a045.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053161S","chronDate":"11-13 Dec. 2013","xplore-pub-id":"6923034","isNumber":"6926081","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923034","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6926081","articleId":"6926100","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2013","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6926108,"authors":[{"name":"Ujjwal Guin","affiliation":["CHASE Center, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Ujjwal","lastName":"Guin","id":"38075528400"},{"name":"Domenic Forte","affiliation":["CHASE Center, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Domenic","lastName":"Forte","id":"37722751400"},{"name":"Mohammad Tehranipoor","affiliation":["CHASE Center, University of Connecticut"],"firstName":"Mohammad","lastName":"Tehranipoor","id":"37293853000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3246-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4093"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5674"}],"articleNumber":"6926108","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":39,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":802},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926108","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["DNA","Supply chains","Integrated circuits","Foundries","Hardware","Reliability","Taxonomy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","supply chain management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["anticounterfeit techniques","counterfeit electronic components","electronic component supply chain"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Counterfeit ICs","Supply Chain Vulnerabilities","Design-for-Anti-Counterfeits","Avoidance Mechanisms"]}],"abstract":"The emerging threat of counterfeit electronic components has become a major challenge over the past decade.

The controller is designed to interface DDR memory modules and memory ICs with low cost FPGAs and high clock frequency of 674.491 MHz at 28nm technology on Kintex 7 FPGA device with less logic utilization. The DDR controller makes many low level tasks invisible to the user like refresh, initialization and timings. It provides another layer of abstraction by optimizing memory access for maximum throughput or minimum latency. DDR controller provides the access of memory banks in parallel form, so it is required to being fast with less logic utilization. This paper optimizes the DDR SDRAM controller design by structural RTL level HDL Coding and modelling of SDRAM Initializing finite state machine (FSM). The results show 0.33% of slice utilization and 0.14% of LUT utilization is recorded at Xilinx Virtex 7 low voltage FPGA device. Due to RTL level optimization the route delay is just about 30% to 38 % as compare to that of logic delay. We also observe that the Kintex 7 Xilinx FPGA device has low offset input and output delay of the clock clk100 and clk200 of data path in this logic as compare to other FPGA devices. So hereby we proposed a DDR SDRAM controller which can work at high speed with less logic utilization and minimum logic, route and offset delay.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["SDRAM","Clocks","Delays","Field programmable gate arrays","Registers","Memory management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","DRAM chips","field programmable gate arrays","finite state machines","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high speed DDR SDRAM controller","synchronous dynamic random access memory","DDR memory modules","memory ICs","less logic utilization","structural RTL level HDL coding","finite state machine","LUT utilization","Xilinx Virtex 7 low voltage FPGA device","RTL level optimization","route delay"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM)","Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)","Double Data Rate (DDR)","VHDL/Verilog","Code optimization"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926129","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926129","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 2nd International Conference on Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 2nd International Conference on Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917157/6926115/06926129.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926115","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926129","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926129/","displayDocTitle":"Design of high speed DDR SDRAM controller with less logic utilization","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14685217","htmlLink":"/document/6926129/","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of high speed DDR SDRAM controller with less logic utilization","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"153.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069737S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917157","isNumber":"6926115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917157","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6926115","articleId":"6926129","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6926130,"authors":[{"name":"Steven Lawrence Fernandes","affiliation":["Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, IN"],"firstName":"Steven Lawrence","lastName":"Fernandes","id":"38610900900"},{"name":"G.

An optimized architecture is demonstrated in this paper for computing FFT of length 8/16/32/64/128/512 and 1024 using Radix-4/Radix 2*2 FFT in FPGA and is compared with Xilinx LogiCore\u2122 FFT IP with configurable point size. It is found that proposed design is more efficient and effective in terms of area and performance while achieving the input system configurability. A novel Address Generator architecture has been proposed which facilitates for Complex Math Processor (CMP). This single generator helps in effectively carrying out the address mapping scheme. The occurrence of hardware overheads is minimized by using the multiplexor for complex arithmetic's. The entire RTL design is described using Verilog HDL and simulated using Xilinx ISim. This experimental result is tested on Spartan-6 XC6SLX4, which is the smallest device on Spartan 6 family and found that Xilinx FFT IP core over maps the available DSP48 slices. The result shows 538 LUT's, 847 Flip Flops, 3 DSP Slices, Maximum Frequency of 217 MHz.

After modulating the signal is sent through channel which is represented by beamforming technique using SVD. The channel is modeled as matrix and decomposed in to number of independent orthogonal modes of excitation which will be referred as eigen modes of channel. The transmit beamforming is produced by conducting the input signal with unitary matrix to perform transmit precoding, and the precoded symbols are transmitted over a Rayleigh fading channel. At receiver side, to retrieve the original input signal, the received signal is convolved with transpose of unitary matrix. The combining process is performed by using maximum ratio combiner (MRC) and receiver shape is performed.

Multiple-valued logic allows the reduction of the required number of signals in the circuit, so can be effectively used to reduce the impact of interconnections [12]. In addition to the reduction in interconnections, multiple-valued logic also offers a possibility of increasing the functional complexity, producing circuits that have performance comparable to the binary circuits. Memory application is an area where the multi-valued approach has been successfully used to design commercial integrated circuits. Memories are designed with objective to reduce area, while maintaining proper timing characteristics. This paper presents a comparative study of delay and power consumption of binary and quaternary circuit implementations of SRAM. Larger number of logic functions can be accommodate in quaternary circuits decreasing the number of data interconnect lines and processing components and logic circuits can represent numbers with fewer bits than binary. Static Noise Margin (SNM) is the most important parameter for memory design, affecting both read and write margin [8]. Both cell ratio and pull-up ratio are important parameters because these are the only parameters in the hand of the design engineer, static noise margin of the SRAM cell depends on the cell ratio (CR), supply voltage and also pull up ratio [8]. We have also found bit rate of both circuits for comparative study.","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926172","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926172","publicationTitle":"2014 2nd International Conference on Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICDCS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 2nd International Conference on Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917157/6926115/06926172.pdf","startPage":"11","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926115","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926172/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"Power, delay and noise margin comparison of binary and quaternary SRAM","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","accessionNumber":"14685192","htmlLink":"/document/6926172/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power, delay and noise margin comparison of binary and quaternary SRAM","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"267.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058988S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917157","isNumber":"6926115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917157","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6926115","articleId":"6926172","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6926173,"authors":[{"name":"D.

Multi Valued Logic [MVL] systems, where the radix is greater than 2 are evolving as a thrust area of research. Ternary logic has gained wide popularity and offers several potential opportunities for the improvement of present VLSI circuit designs. Ternary gates form the fundamental element for numerous ternary circuits, making its efficient design and simulation indispensable. This paper presents the implementation and simulation of ternary gates (TNOT, TNAND, TNOR) using injected voltage method. The binary CMOS logic is exploited to achieve the ternary logic values. The performance analysis of the ternary gates in terms of rise time, fall time and power dissipation is examined using Tanner Tool, version 13.02. The prominent subsets (S-Edit, L-Edit, T-Spice and W-Edit) of the tanner tool are used to derive the various device parameters and further verify the functionality of the gates.

The feature extraction and denoising of ECG are highly useful in cardiology. Wavelet based methods present best performance as irregularity measures and makes them suitable for ECG data analysis. This paper proposes comparison of different feature extraction and denoising techniques using wavelet transform. In an ECG with P-QRS-T wave, QRS complex has the most striking part for analysis. The first part of the paper deals with comparison of three different feature extraction techniques using wavelet transform. The second part deals with the denoising of ECG signal using three different wavelet transform. The most troublesome noise sources contain frequency components within ECG spectrum, i.e. electrical activity of the muscles and instability of electrode skin contact. Such noises are difficult to remove using typical filter procedure. In such cases signal noise reduction is only possible with wavelet denoising techniques. The comparison of different wavelet transform techniques for feature extraction and denoising of ECG signal is mentioned, which is suitable for the selection of most applicable techniques. Wavelet transform is a powerful tool for the analysis of ECG signal.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A review on feature extraction and denoising of ECG signal using wavelet transform","publicationTitle":"2014 2nd International Conference on Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICDCS)","doi":"10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926190","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 2nd International Conference on Devices, Circuits and Systems (ICDCS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917157/6926115/06926190.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICDCSyst.2014.6926190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926190","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926190/","chronOrPublicationDate":"6-8 March 2014","displayDocTitle":"A review on feature extraction and denoising of ECG signal using wavelet transform","conferenceDate":"6-8 March 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926190/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"March 2014","accessionNumber":"14685177","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A review on feature extraction and denoising of ECG signal using wavelet transform","confLoc":"Coimbatore, India","sourcePdf":"290.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039522S","chronDate":"6-8 March 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917157","isNumber":"6926115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917157","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6926115","articleId":"6926190","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6926201,"authors":[{"name":"V.

Motion is an essential area of social communication that will enable robots and people to collaborate naturally, develop rapport, and seamlessly share environments. The proposed work presents a principled set of motion features based on the Laban Effort system, a widespread and extensively tested acting ontology for the dynamics of \u201chow\u201d we enact motion. The features allow us to analyze and, in future work, generate expressive motion using position (x, y) and orientation (theta). We formulate representative features for each Effort and parameterize them on expressive motion sample trajectories collected from experts in robotics and theater. We then produce classifiers for different \u201cmanners\u201d of moving and assess the quality of results by comparing them to the humans labeling the same set of paths on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Results indicate that the machine analysis (41.7% match between intended and classified manner) achieves similar accuracy overall compared to a human benchmark (41.2% match). We conclude that these motion features perform well for analyzing expression in low degree of freedom systems and could be used to help design more effectively expressive mobile robots.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Trajectory","Vectors","Mobile robots","Acceleration","Accuracy","Training"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction","mobile robots","ontologies (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["expressive motion","Laban effort features","expressive mobile robots","social communication","Laban effort system","extensively tested acting ontology","Amazon Mechanical Turk","machine analysis","low degree of freedom systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926264","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926264","displayPublicationTitle":"The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel7/6919203/6926219/06926264.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926264","startPage":"267","endPage":"273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926219","publicationTitle":"The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Expressive motion with x, y and theta: Laban Effort Features for mobile robots","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Expressive motion with x, y and theta: Laban Effort Features for mobile robots","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926264/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2014","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926264/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695021","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Expressive motion with x, y and theta: Laban Effort Features for mobile robots","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"0150.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09981S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6919203","isNumber":"6926219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6919203","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6926219","articleId":"6926264","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6926290,"authors":[{"name":"Javier Garrido","affiliation":["Departamento de Control Automatico, CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Javier","lastName":"Garrido","id":"37085390234"},{"name":"Wen Yu","affiliation":["Departamento de Control Automatico, CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico City, Mexico"],"firstName":"Wen","lastName":"Yu","id":"37085363539"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9445"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"}],"articleNumber":"6926290","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":152},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Joints","Trajectory","Robots","Aerospace electronics","Training","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hidden Markov models","path planning","robot kinematics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["trajectory generation","modified hidden Markov model","human training","work space method","inverse kinematics","joint space method","dynamic time warping","Lloyd's algorithm","HMM training data generation","task space"]}],"abstract":"Human guide robots need to generate a trajectory from human training. The popular work space methods have to calculate the inverse kinematics. While the joint space methods need the dynamic time warping. These destroy the accuracy of the trajectory model. In this paper, we use Lloyd's algorithm to hidden Markov model (HMM). The advantages of the method over the other HMM are the time difference does not affects the HMM training, and the training data can be generated in joint space. We also modify the traditional HMM such that the model in the joint space works similar as the task space.

A Dynamic Bayesian Mixture Model (DBMM) is designed to combine multiple classifier likelihoods into a single form, assigning weights (by an uncertainty measure) to counterbalance the likelihoods as a posterior probability. Temporal information is incorporated in the DBMM by means of prior probabilities, taking into consideration previous probabilistic inference to reinforce current-frame classification. The publicly available Cornell Activity Dataset [1] with 12 different human activities was used to evaluate the proposed approach. Reported results on testing dataset show that our approach overcomes state of the art methods in terms of precision, recall and overall accuracy. The developed work allows the use of activities classification for applications where the human behaviour recognition is important, such as human-robot interaction, assisted living for elderly care, among others.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A probabilistic approach for human everyday activities recognition using body motion from RGB-D images","publicationTitle":"The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926340","displayPublicationTitle":"The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel7/6919203/6926219/06926340.pdf","startPage":"732","endPage":"737","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926340","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926340","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926340/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A probabilistic approach for human everyday activities recognition using body motion from RGB-D images","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695050","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A probabilistic approach for human everyday activities recognition using body motion from RGB-D images","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"0187.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061514S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6919203","isNumber":"6926219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6919203","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"6926219","articleId":"6926340","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6926342,"authors":[{"name":"E.

For natural interaction, a robot must detect people without waiting for them to face the camera, get far enough away to be fully present, or center themselves fully within the field of view. Furthermore, it must happen without requiring immense amounts of processing that are not practical for real systems. In this work we focus on person detection in a guidance scenario, where occlusion is particularly prevalent. Using a layered approach with depth images, we can substantially improve detection rates under high levels of occlusion, and enable a robot to detect a target that is moving into and out of the field of view.","displayPublicationTitle":"The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","pdfPath":"/iel7/6919203/6926219/06926342.pdf","startPage":"744","endPage":"749","publicationTitle":"The 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Robot and Human Interactive Communication","doi":"10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926342","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ROMAN.2014.6926342","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926219","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926342","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detecting occluded people for robotic guidance","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cameras","Feature extraction","Robot vision systems","Mathematical model","Head"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["human-robot interaction","object detection","robot vision"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["target detection","detection rates","depth images","layered approach","person detection","human-robot interaction","robotic guidance","occluded people detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926342/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Detecting occluded people for robotic guidance","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926342/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695079","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"25-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detecting occluded people for robotic guidance","confLoc":"Edinburgh, UK","sourcePdf":"0066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076708S","chronDate":"25-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6919203","isNumber":"6926219","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6919203","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6926219","articleId":"6926342","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6926367,"authors":[{"name":"Haruhisa Kawasaki","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan"],"firstName":"Haruhisa","lastName":"Kawasaki","id":"37270111700"},{"name":"Masayasu Kayukawa","affiliation":["Faculty of Engineering, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan"],"firstName":"Masayasu","lastName":"Kayukawa","id":"37085587894"},{"name":"Hirofumi Sakaeda","affiliation":["Gifu Red Cross Hospital, Gifu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hirofumi","lastName":"Sakaeda","id":"37600534700"},{"name":"Tetsuya Mouri","affiliation":["Gifu Daigaku, Gifu, Gifu, JP"],"firstName":"Tetsuya","lastName":"Mouri","id":"37295002400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6765-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-6763-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1944-9445"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1944-9437"}],"articleNumber":"6926367","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":249},"abstract":"This paper presents a novel learning system for myoelectric prosthetic hand control by forearm amputees using estimations of continuous joint angles.

This study applies the OFDM technology to the transmission in the physical layer of a WSN. Sequential matches of system operations are performed for various parts of the system through five synchronization modules in order to achieve input data compensation. This effectively corrects the carrier frequency deviations of the system and subsequently improves the anti-interference capability of the system.

Matrix decomposition can decompose a given matrix into two components if they have low-rank and sparse properties. This fits the case of HSI denoising when an HSI is reorganized as a matrix, because the noise-free signal of HSI has low rank due to the high correlations within its content, while the noise of HSI has structured sparsity with respect to the big volume of data. Moreover, matrix decomposition avoids denoising process falling into the dependence on distribution characteristics of the noise or making some idealized assumptions on HSI signal and noise. In this paper, a two-phase matrix decomposition scheme is presented. First, by employing the low-rank property of HSI signal and the structured sparsity of HSI noise, the hyperspectral data matrix is decomposed into a basic signal component and a rough noise component. Then, the latter is further decomposed into a spatial compensation part and a final noise part, via using the band-by-band total variation (TV) regularization. A number of simulated and real data experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach produces superior denoising results for different HSI noise patterns within a wide range of noise levels.","doi":"10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2360409","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/4609443/6948291/06926745.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTARS.2014.2360409","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6948291","startPage":"3742","endPage":"3754","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Denoising of Hyperspectral Images Employing Two-Phase Matrix Decomposition","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Denoising of Hyperspectral Images Employing Two-Phase Matrix Decomposition","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926745/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"7","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14710403","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","htmlLink":"/document/6926745/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)"},{"fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Denoising of Hyperspectral Images Employing Two-Phase Matrix Decomposition","sourcePdf":"jstars-li-2360409-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.207409S","chronDate":"Sept.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4609443","isNumber":"6948291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4609443","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"6948291","articleId":"6926745","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926762,"authors":[{"name":"Tom B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m","affiliation":["International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, Fraunhofer Institute of Integrated Circuits, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"B\u00e4ckstr\u00f6m","id":"37267733500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1070-9908"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2361"}],"articleNumber":"6926762","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":350},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Discrete Fourier transforms","Decorrelation","Matrix decomposition","Time-frequency analysis","Harmonic analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive signal processing","channel bank filters","discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MVDR filterbanks","nonuniform discrete Fourier transform","minimum variance distortionless response","signal adaptive spectral analysis","filter design","domain signal components","Vandermonde decomposition","autocorrelation matrix","Pisarenko harmonic decomposition"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Minimum-variance distortionless response","Pisarenko\u2019s harmonic decomposition","time-frequency transform","Vandermonde transform"]}],"abstract":"Minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) is a classic design criteria in signal adaptive spectral analysis as well as filter design. We extend this approach to filterbanks with the constraint that transform domain signal components must be uncorrelated. Our analysis shows that filterbanks based on Vandermonde decomposition of the autocorrelation matrix correspond to the non-uniform discrete Fourier transform and satisfies the MVDR criteria. Namely, the columns of the inverse Vandermonde matrix corresponds to filters with unit response at the pass-band while leakage is minimized with the constraint that components remain uncorrelated. In the special case that the autocorrelation matrix is rank deficient, the proposed filterbank coincides with Pisarenko's harmonic decomposition, which thus also satisfies the MVDR criteria.","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2014.2363234","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/97/6917086/06926762.pdf","startPage":"479","endPage":"483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2014.2363234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6917086","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Decorrelating MVDR Filterbanks Using the Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926762","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926762/","displayDocTitle":"Decorrelating MVDR Filterbanks Using the Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform","volume":"22","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"14681621","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926762/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Decorrelating MVDR Filterbanks Using the Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform","sourcePdf":"lsp-backstrom-2363234-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068413S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"6917086","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6917086","articleId":"6926762","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926763,"authors":[{"name":"Yihai Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical, Computer, and Biomedical Engineering, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10206/6953163/6926763/zhu-2363786-small.gif","p":["Yihai Zhu (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in computer science and technology from the Hefei University of Technology (HFUT), Hefei, China, in 2007, the M.S. degree in pattern recognition and intelligent systems from the University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, China, in 2010, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA, in 2014.","Dr. Zhu\u2019s research interests include cybersecurity, smart grid security, cyber-physical systems, big data, and pattern recognition.

In the current literature, researchers reveal the vulnerability of power grids under the assumption that substations/transmission lines are removed or attacked synchronously. In reality, however, it is highly possible that such removals can be conducted sequentially. Motivated by this idea, we discover a new attack scenario, called the sequential attack, which assumes that substations/transmission lines can be removed sequentially, not synchronously. In particular, we find that the sequential attack can discover many combinations of substation whose failures can cause large blackout size. Previously, these combinations are ignored by the synchronous attack. In addition, we propose a new metric, called the sequential attack graph (SAG), and a practical attack strategy based on SAG. In simulations, we adopt three test benchmarks and five comparison schemes. Referring to simulation results and complexity analysis, we find that the proposed scheme has strong performance and low complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TIFS.2014.2363786","startPage":"2340","endPage":"2354","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIFS.2014.2363786","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6953163","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security","pdfPath":"/iel7/10206/6953163/06926763.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resilience Analysis of Power Grids Under the Sequential Attack","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926763/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Resilience Analysis of Power Grids Under the Sequential Attack","volume":"9","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6926763/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14759239","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1117314, CNS-0643532 and ECCS-1053717"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"W911NF-12-1-0378"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resilience Analysis of Power Grids Under the Sequential Attack","sourcePdf":"tifs-zhu-2363786-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.13533S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"10206","isNumber":"6953163","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10206","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"6953163","articleId":"6926763","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6926764,"authors":[{"name":"Ni Chen","affiliation":["Education Department of Guangdong Province, Key Laboratory of Software Technology, China","Engineering Research Center of Supercomputing Engineering Software, Ministry of Education, China","Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7203181/6926764/wchen-2360923-small.gif","p":["Ni Chen (S\u201911) received the B.S. degree in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2009, where she is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","Her current research interests include global optimization, evolutionary algorithm, multiobjective optimization, and their applications in scheduling."]},"firstName":"Ni","lastName":"Chen","id":"38025669100"},{"name":"Wei-Neng Chen","affiliation":["Education Department of Guangdong Province, Key Laboratory of Software Technology, China","Engineering Research Center of Supercomputing Engineering Software, Ministry of Education, China","Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7203181/6926764/chen-2360923-small.gif","p":["Wei-Neng Chen (S\u201907\u2013M\u201912) received the bachelor\u2019s and Ph.D. degrees from the Department of Computer Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2006 and 2012, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the School of Advanced Computing, Sun Yat-sen University.

Though the problem decomposition approach generally converges faster through optimizing all the sub-problems simultaneously, there are two issues not fully addressed, i.e., distribution of solutions often depends on a priori problem decomposition, and the lack of population diversity among sub-problems. In this paper, a MOEA with double-level archives is developed. The algorithm takes advantages of both the multiobjective-problem-level and the sub-problem-level approaches by introducing two types of archives, i.e., the global archive and the sub-archive. In each generation, self-reproduction with the global archive and cross-reproduction between the global archive and sub-archives both breed new individuals. The global archive and sub-archives communicate through cross-reproduction, and are updated using the reproduced individuals. Such a framework thus retains fast convergence, and at the same time handles solution distribution along Pareto front (PF) with scalability. To test the performance of the proposed algorithm, experiments are conducted on both the widely used benchmarks and a set of truly disconnected problems. The results verify that, compared with state-of-the-art MOEAs, the proposed algorithm offers competitive advantages in distance to the PF, solution coverage, and search speed.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926764/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15365143","pubMedId":"25343775","htmlLink":"/document/6926764/","isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"45","issue":"9","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"An Evolutionary Algorithm with Double-Level Archives for Multiobjective Optimization","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High-Technology Research and Development Program (863 Program) of China","grantNumber":"2013AA01A212"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)","grantNumber":"61402545 and 61379061"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Key Program","grantNumber":"61332002"},{"fundingName":"NSFC for Distinguished Young Scholars","grantNumber":"61125205"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"An Evolutionary Algorithm with Double-Level Archives for Multiobjective Optimization","sourcePdf":"tcyb-zhang-2360923-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.152891S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7203181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"7203181","articleId":"6926764","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926766,"authors":[{"name":"Muhammad Naeem","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ryerson University, Toronto, ON, Canada","COMSATS Institute of Information Technology-Wah, Wah Cantonment, Pakistan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6982245/6926766/naeem-2363571-small.gif","p":["Muhammad Naeem (S\u201909\u2013M\u201912) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila, Pakistan, in 2000 and 2005, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, BC, Canada, in 2011.

These devices include low-power wireless sensors, personal wireless hub (PWH), and receivers. The PWH can act as a relay in the hospital network. To help the wireless sensor devices, we use multiple PWHs to transfer sensor data to the main central controller. The use of multiple PWHs can increase the performance of the wireless network in the hospital. It also adds reliability to the coverage of the wireless network. In this paper, we propose a framework and low-complexity algorithm for interference aware joint power control and multiple PWH assignment (IAJPCPA) in a hospital building with cognitive radio capability. In the proposed framework, any wireless sensor device can send and receive data from multiple PWHs. The proposed IAJPCPA is a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem, which is generally NP-hard. The main objective of IAJPCPA is to maximize the total transmission data rate by assigning PWHs to the wireless sensor devices under the constraint of acceptable interference to the licensed wireless devices. To this end, we present an efficient PWH assignment and power control scheme for IAJPCPA problem by employing an upper bound on the IAJPCPA that converts the nonconvex problem into a convex optimization problem. Finally, we examine the effect of different system parameters on the performance of the proposed algorithm.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6982245/06926766.pdf","startPage":"1463","endPage":"1474","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2363571","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2363571","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982245","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926766","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Wireless Resource Allocation in Next Generation Healthcare Facilities","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless sensor networks","Sensors","Hospitals","Interference","Cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical communication","cognitive radio","computational complexity","concave programming","health care","integer programming","interference suppression","nonlinear programming","power control","resource allocation","telecommunication control","telecommunication network reliability","telemedicine","wireless sensor networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wireless resource allocation","next generation healthcare facilities","intelligent wireless devices","low-power wireless sensor devices","personal wireless hub","receivers","hospital network","central controller","multiple PWHs","reliability","wireless network","low-complexity algorithm","interference aware joint power control and multiple PWH assignment","cognitive radio capability","hospital building","NP-hard problem","nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem","total transmission data rate","upper bound","IAJPCPA problem","convex optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Relays","PWHs","Wireless sensor devices","Automated hospitals","Interference aware power control"]},{"kwd":["Relays","PWHs","wireless sensor devices","automated hospitals","interference aware power control"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926766/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Wireless Resource Allocation in Next Generation Healthcare Facilities","volume":"15","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/6926766/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14818245","dateOfInsertion":"11 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSERC Discovery Grants"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wireless Resource Allocation in Next Generation Healthcare Facilities","sourcePdf":"jsen-anpalagan-2363571-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.149377S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6982245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6982245","articleId":"6926766","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926770,"authors":[{"name":"F.

Due to their enormous bandwidth, it is considered that they are the main channel medium that can offer broadband multiservices using optical multiplexing techniques. Amongst these, mode group diversity multiplexing (MGDM) has been proposed as a way to integrate various services over an MMF network by exciting different groups of modes that can be used as independent and parallel communication channels. In this paper, we study optical multiple-input-multiple-output (O-MIMO) systems using MGDM techniques while also optimizing the launching conditions of light at the fiber inputs and the spot size, radial offset, angular offset, wavelength, and the radii of the segment areas of the detectors. We propose a new approach based on the optimization of launching and detection conditions in order to increase the capacity of an O-MIMO link using the MGDM technique. We propose a (3 \u00d7 3) O-MIMO system, where our simulation results show significant improvement in GI MMFs' capacity compared with existing O-MIMO systems.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Novel Method for Improving the Capacity of Optical MIMO System Using MGDM","publicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","doi":"10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2363444","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Photonics Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/4563994/6935058/06926770.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"15","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPHOT.2014.2363444","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6935058","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926770","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926770/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Novel Method for Improving the Capacity of Optical MIMO System Using MGDM","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"6","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/6926770/","dateOfInsertion":"27 October 2014","isOpenAccess":true,"externalId":"7903515","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695915","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"Novel Method for Improving the Capacity of Optical MIMO System Using MGDM","sourcePdf":"jphot-haxha-2363444-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.06842S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4563994","isNumber":"6935058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4563994","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6935058","articleId":"6926770","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926772,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Faizal Abd Rahman","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universiti Teknologi MARA, Penang, Malaysia","Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/6982245/6926772/rahma-2363680-small.gif","p":["Mohamad Faizal Abd Rahman received the B.Eng. degree in electronics from the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology, Manchester, U.K., in 2001, the M.Sc. degree in electronic system design engineering from USM, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and electronic engineering from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM), Penang, Malaysia.

First, the pulse catch technique was used to investigate the device's response toward acoustic pulse or burst signal. The result shows that different number of burst cycles affects the capacitive response of the device. Providing the acoustic projector with suitable burst cycle parameter had yielded capacitive response with resolution of 1.16 pF, which is useful to be deployed in any suitable application such as for control or communication purposes. Second, the vibration effect had been studied between the ranges of 10-100 Hz of vibration. For rapid transition of the vibration frequency, the fall transition has a comparable error compared with the rise transition with an error ratio of 37:1. In terms of fluctuation behavior of the response, operating the device at static or constant frequency vibration does not have significant differences on the response, indicating its stability at single-frequency operation.","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2014.2363680","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel7/7361/6982245/06926772.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2014.2363680","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6982245","startPage":"1559","endPage":"1566","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Characterization of Microfluidic-Based Acoustic Sensor for Immersion Application","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926772","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of Microfluidic-Based Acoustic Sensor for Immersion Application","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926772/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"15","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2015","accessionNumber":"14818227","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6926772/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Postgraduate Research Grant Scheme (PRGS)"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003782","fundingName":"Research University (RU) grants from University Sains Malaysia"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of Microfluidic-Based Acoustic Sensor for Immersion Application","sourcePdf":"jsen-abdrahman-2363680-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081053S","chronDate":"March  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"6982245","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6982245","articleId":"6926772","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926773,"authors":[{"name":"Georgios I.

An effective solution for VSTLF can facilitate real-time electricity deployment and improve its quality. In this paper, a novel approach to model the very short-term load of individual households based on context information and daily schedule pattern analysis is proposed. Several daily behavior pattern types were obtained by analyzing the time series of daily electricity consumption, and context features from various sources were collected and used to establish a rule set for use in anticipating the likely behavior pattern type of a specific day. Meanwhile, an electricity consumption volume prediction model was developed for each behavior pattern type to predict the load at a specific time point in a day. This study was concerned with solving the VSTLF for individual households in Taiwan. The proposed approach obtained an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.23% and 2.44% for forecasting individual household load and aggregation load 30-min ahead, respectively, which is more favorable than other methods.","doi":"10.1109/TII.2014.2363584","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics","pdfPath":"/iel7/9424/7027294/06926785.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"43","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TII.2014.2363584","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7027294","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926785","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Household Electricity Demand Forecast Based on Context Information and User Daily Schedule Analysis From Meter Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Household Electricity Demand Forecast Based on Context Information and User Daily Schedule Analysis From Meter Data","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","volume":"11","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926785/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14915061","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001868","fundingName":"National Science Council of Taiwan","grantNumber":"NSC 101-2410-H-305-079"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Household Electricity Demand Forecast Based on Context Information and User Daily Schedule Analysis From Meter Data","sourcePdf":"tii-hsiao-2363584-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058709S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"9424","isNumber":"7027294","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9424","citationCount":"92","xplore-issue":"7027294","articleId":"6926785","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":6926789,"authors":[{"name":"Oliver Thiergart","affiliation":["International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Thiergart","id":"37681767200"},{"name":"Maja Taseska","affiliation":["International Audio Laboratories Erlangen, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany"],"firstName":"Maja","lastName":"Taseska","id":"38522728700"},{"name":"Emanu\u00ebl A.

In practical situations, where the position and number of active sources may be unknown and time-varying, conventional implementations of spatial filters do not provide sufficiently good performance. Recently, informed spatial filters have been introduced that incorporate almost instantaneous parametric information on the sound field, thereby enabling adaptation to new acoustic conditions and moving sources. In this contribution, we propose a spatial filter which generalizes the recently proposed informed linearly constrained minimum variance filter and informed minimum mean square error filter. The proposed filter uses multiple direction-of-arrival estimates and second-order statistics of the noise and diffuse sound. To determine those statistics, an optimal diffuse power estimator is proposed that outperforms state-of-the-art estimators. Extensive performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed filter in dynamic acoustic conditions. For this purpose, we have considered a challenging scenario which consists of quickly moving sound sources during double-talk. The performance of the proposed spatial filter was evaluated in terms of objective measures including segmental signal-to-reverberation ratio and log spectral distance, and by means of a listening test confirming the objective results.","doi":"10.1109/TASLP.2014.2363407","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2014.2363407","startPage":"2182","endPage":"2196","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6570655/6882846/06926789.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6882846","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Informed Parametric Spatial Filter Based on Instantaneous Direction-of-Arrival Estimates","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"An Informed Parametric Spatial Filter Based on Instantaneous Direction-of-Arrival Estimates","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"24 October 2014","volume":"22","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926789/","accessionNumber":"14679741","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926789/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Informed Parametric Spatial Filter Based on Instantaneous Direction-of-Arrival Estimates","sourcePdf":"taslp-thiergart-2363407-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047357S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","isNumber":"6882846","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6570655","citationCount":"46","articleId":"6926789","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6926800,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Xiang Zou","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7035183/6926800/zou-2363442-small.gif","p":["\nZhi-Xiang Zou (S'12) received the B.Eng. degree from Southeast \nUniversity, Nanjing, China, in 2007, where he currently working toward the Ph.D. degree.","From 2007 to 2008, he was with the State Grid Electric Power Research Institute, Nanjing, where he was engaged in \nrelay protection design projects.

However, classical RC cannot exactly compensate periodic signals of variable frequency and would lead to significant performance degradation of APFs. In this paper, a fractional-order RC (FORC) strategy at a fixed sampling rate is proposed to deal with any periodic signal of variable frequency, where a Lagrange-interpolation-based fractional delay (FD) filter is used to approximate the factional delay items. The synthesis and analysis of FORC systems are also presented. The proposed FORC offers fast online tuning of the FD and the fast update of the coefficients, and then provides APFs with a simple but very accurate real-time frequency-adaptive control solution to the elimination of harmonic distortions under grid frequency variations.

To improve the multiplexing gain, successive relaying, which allows concurrent transmission of the source and relays, has been proposed. However, the severe inter-relay interference becomes a key challenge. In this paper, we propose a channel aware successive relaying protocol, also referred to as CAO-SIR, which is capable of thoroughly mitigating inter-relay interference by carefully adapting relays' transmission order and rate. In particular, a relay having a poorer link to the source is scheduled first to forward a message, the data rate of which is adapted to the link quality of the source-relay and relay-destination channels. By this means, each relay may decode the messages intended for the preceding relays, and then cancel these relays' interference in a low complexity which is equal to that of Decision Feedback Equalizer (DFE). To further optimize and analyze CAO-SIR, we present its equivalent parallel relay channel model, based upon which the adaptive relay selection and power allocation schemes are proposed. By employing M half duplex relays, CAO-SIR is capable of achieving an diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) given by d(r) = max (M + 1) 1- {(M+2/M+1r)} , (1 - r) , where d(r) and r denote the diversity and multiplexing gains, respectively. Its DMT asymptotically approaches the DMT upper bound achieved by (M + 1) \u00d7 1 MISO systems or M full duplex relays, when M is large.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2363453","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6979302/06926805.pdf","startPage":"6513","endPage":"6527","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2363453","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CAO-SIR: Channel Aware Ordered Successive Relaying","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"CAO-SIR: Channel Aware Ordered Successive Relaying","volume":"13","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6926805/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"isOpenAccess":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14824359","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926805/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program)","grantNumber":"2013CB336600"},{"fundingName":"NSFC Excellent Young Investigator","grantNumber":"61322111"},{"fundingName":"973 Program","grantNumber":"2012CB316000"},{"fundingName":"National innovative talents promotion program","grantNumber":"2013RA2151"},{"fundingName":"Beijing nova program","grantNumber":"Z121101002512051"},{"fundingName":"MoE new century talent program","grantNumber":"NCET-12-0302"},{"fundingName":"MoE self-determined research project","grantNumber":"20131089396"},{"fundingName":"National science & technology key projects","grantNumber":"2013ZX03003006-005 and 2013ZX03003004-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"T","title":"CAO-SIR: Channel Aware Ordered Successive Relaying","sourcePdf":"twc-chen-2363453-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139511S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6979302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"6979302","articleId":"6926805","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"OAPA","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6926811,"authors":[{"name":"Guilherme Correa","affiliation":["Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es, Polo II-Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/76/7076665/6926811/corre-2363753-small.gif","p":["Guilherme Correa (M\u201908) received the B.Sc. degree in computer science from Federal University of Pelotas, Pelotas, Brazil, in 2009 and the M.Sc. degree in computer science from Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 2010.

An important share of this increase is due to the new flexible partitioning structures, namely the coding trees, the prediction units, and the residual quadtrees, with the best configurations decided through an exhaustive rate-distortion optimization (RDO) process. In this paper, we propose a set of procedures for deciding whether the partition structure optimization algorithm should be terminated early or run to the end of an exhaustive search for the best configuration. The proposed schemes are based on decision trees obtained through data mining techniques. By extracting intermediate data, such as encoding variables from a training set of video sequences, three sets of decision trees are built and implemented to avoid running the RDO algorithm to its full extent. When separately implemented, these schemes achieve average computational complexity reductions (CCRs) of up to 50% at a negligible cost of 0.56% in terms of Bjontegaard Delta (BD) rate increase. When the schemes are jointly implemented, an average CCR of up to 65% is achieved, with a small BD-rate increase of 1.36%. Extensive experiments and comparisons with similar works demonstrate that the proposed early termination schemes achieve the best rate-distortion-complexity tradeoffs among all the compared works.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2363753","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7076665/06926811.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2363753","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7076665","startPage":"660","endPage":"673","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast HEVC Encoding Decisions Using Data Mining","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926811","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Fast HEVC Encoding Decisions Using Data Mining","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15035643","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6926811/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Brazilian Agency for Scientific and Technological Development, Brazil"},{"fundingName":"National Council for the Improvement of Higher Education, Brazil"},{"fundingName":"Foundation for Science and Technology","grantNumber":"FCT/1909/27/2/2014/S"},{"fundingName":"Instituto de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast HEVC Encoding Decisions Using Data Mining","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-correa-2363753-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094111S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7076665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"135","xplore-issue":"7076665","articleId":"6926811","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926812,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolae-Cristian Sintamarean","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6996060/6926812/sintam-small.gif","p":["Nicolae-Cristian Sintamarean (S\u201912) received the B.Sc. degree\n in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, Cluj-Napoca, Romania, in 2010, and the M.Sc.\n degree in power electronics and drives from Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark, in 2012, where he is currently\n working toward the Ph.D. degree.","His current research interests include the design of the new generation of power electronics converters for\n renewable energy systems and the reliability of power electronic systems."]},"firstName":"Nicolae-Cristian","lastName":"Sintamarean","id":"38266073400"},{"name":"Frede Blaabjerg","affiliation":["Department of Energy Technology, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/63/6996060/6926812/blaab-small.gif","p":["Frede Blaabjerg\n (S\u201986\u2013M\u201988\u2013SM\u201997\u2013F\u201903) received the Ph.D. degree from Aalborg University,\n Aalborg, Denmark, in 1992.","He was with ABB-Scandia, Randers, Denmark, from 1987 to 1988.

An accurate long-term simulation model able to consider the one-year RFMP (solar irradiance and ambient temperature) is developed. Thus, the one-year estimation of the converter device thermal loading distribution is achieved and is further used as an input to the lifetime model. The proposed reliability-oriented design tool is used to study the impact of mission profile (MP) variation and device degradation (aging) in the PV inverter lifetime. The obtained results indicate that the MP of the field where the PV inverter is operating has an important impact (up to 70%) on the converter lifetime expectation, and it should be considered in the design stage to better optimize the converter design margin. In order to have correct lifetime estimation, it is crucial to consider also the device degradation feedback (in the simulation model), which has an impact of 20-30% on the precision of the lifetime estimation for the studied case.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/63/6996060/06926812.pdf","startPage":"2635","endPage":"2644","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TPEL.2014.2361918","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPEL.2014.2361918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6996060","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926812","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reliability Oriented Design Tool For the New Generation of Grid Connected PV-Inverters","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Reliability engineering","Semiconductor device modeling","Stress","Inverters","Load modeling","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["invertors","photovoltaic power systems","power generation reliability","power grids","power semiconductor devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["reliability oriented design tool","grid connected PV-inverters generation","real field mission profile","RFMP model","grid-connected PV inverter model","electrothermal model","PV panel model","power semiconductor devices","solar irradiance","converter device thermal loading distribution","reliability-oriented design tool","device degradation","converter lifetime expectation","device degradation feedback"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mission profile variation","device degradation feedback","long term simulation"]},{"kwd":["Device degradation feedback","long-term simulation","mission profile variation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926812/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Reliability Oriented Design Tool For the New Generation of Grid Connected PV-Inverters","volume":"30","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6926812/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"14834909","dateOfInsertion":"24 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reliability Oriented Design Tool For the New Generation of Grid Connected PV-Inverters","sourcePdf":"tpel-sintamarean-2361918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073996S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"63","isNumber":"6996060","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"63","citationCount":"90","xplore-issue":"6996060","articleId":"6926812","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-30"},{"_id":6926827,"authors":[{"name":"Sangshin Kwak","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Chung-ang University, Dongjak-gu, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9424/7027294/6926827/skwak-2363761-small.gif","p":["Sangshin Kwak (S\u201902\u2013M\u201905) received the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA, in 2005.","From 1999 to 2000, he worked as a Research Engineer with LG Electronics, Changwon, Korea.

For a class of X-channels, the results show how to optimally use distributed and moderately delayed CSIT to yield the same sum-DoF as instantaneous and global CSIT.

This paper presents a novel computationally efficient high-resolution wideband synchronous sampling algorithm for the mechanical fault detection of variable-speed direct-drive wind turbines (i.e., no gearbox) only using nonstationary generator stator current measurements. The proposed algorithm synchronously resamples the current signals such that the varying characteristic frequencies of the excitations generated by wind turbine faults in the current signals become constant values. An impulse detection algorithm is then proposed to detect the faults by identifying the excitations from the frequency spectra of the synchronously sampled stator current signals.

Such networks are referred to as heterogeneous networks. There have been various attempts at modeling and optimization of such networks using spatial point processes, some of which are alluded to (later) in this paper. We model a heterogeneous network consisting of two types of base stations by using a particular Poisson cluster process model. The main contributions are two-fold. First, a complete description of the interference in heterogeneous networks is derived in the form of its Laplace functional. Second, using an asymptotic convergence result which was shown in our previous work, we derive the expressions for the mean and variance of the distribution to which the interference converges. The utility of this framework is discussed for both the contributions.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2363454","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/7035161/06926852.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2363454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7035161","startPage":"1035","endPage":"1047","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Modeling and Analysis of Heterogeneous Radio Access Networks Using a Poisson Cluster Process","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926852","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Modeling and Analysis of Heterogeneous Radio Access Networks Using a Poisson Cluster Process","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926852/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"14","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","accessionNumber":"14914668","dateOfInsertion":"06 February 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6926852/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100000780","fundingName":"European Commission"},{"fundingName":"Danish Council for Independent Research\u2014Natural Sciences","grantNumber":"12-124675"},{"fundingName":"Centre for Stochastic Geometry and Advanced Bioimaging"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Modeling and Analysis of Heterogeneous Radio Access Networks Using a Poisson Cluster Process","sourcePdf":"twc-suryaprakash-2363454-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.078713S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"7035161","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7035161","articleId":"6926852","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926855,"authors":[{"name":"Sung-Yeon Kim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7268796/6926855/kim-2363476-small.gif","p":["\nSung-Yeon Kim received the B.S. degree from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007, where he is currently working toward the joint M.S. and Ph.D. degrees, all in electrical and electronic engineering.","His research interests include cooperative communication, performance analysis, and optimization in communication networks."]},"firstName":"Sung-Yeon","lastName":"Kim","id":"37069747600"},{"name":"Jeong-Ahn Kwon","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7268796/6926855/kwon-2363476-small.gif","p":["\nJeong-Ahn Kwon received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical and electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 2006 and 2008, respectively.","His research areas include opportunistic scheduling, resource allocation, optimization, and small-cell and heterogeneous networks."]},"firstName":"Jeong-Ahn","lastName":"Kwon","id":"37892845400"},{"name":"Jang-Won Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7268796/6926855/lee-2363476-small.gif","p":["\nJang-Won Lee (SM'12) received the B.S. degree in electronic engineering from Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea, in 1994; the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 1996; and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2004.","During 1997\u20131998, he was with Dacom R&D Center, Daejeon.

However, since the problems are notoriously difficult and complex, only heuristic approaches are mainly used to study them, instead of the optimal approach for achieving maximum system capacity. In this paper, we study this problem from the viewpoint of optimal subchannel allocation and power control, aiming at maximizing the sum rate of the multicell OFDMA system. By using a monotonic optimization approach, we develop an algorithm for the optimal subchannel allocation and power control that achieves the maximum sum rate of the system. In addition, we also develop an algorithm that provides both upper and lower bounds on the maximum sum rate of the system with lower computational complexity. To evaluate the tightness of the upper and lower bounds, we also study the conditions when the two bounds are close to each other so that they can be good approximations to the maximum sum rate of the system. Through numerical results, we show that the bounds provide good approximations to the maximum sum rate of the multicell OFDMA system in most cases.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2363476","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7268796/06926855.pdf","startPage":"4158","endPage":"4169","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2363476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7268796","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sum-Rate Maximization for Multicell OFDMA Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926855","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926855/","displayDocTitle":"Sum-Rate Maximization for Multicell OFDMA Systems","volume":"64","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456569","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926855/","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Mid-career Researcher Program through the National Research Foundation","grantNumber":"2013R1A2A2A01069053"},{"fundingName":"ICT R&D Program of MSIP/IITP","grantNumber":"14-823-04-002"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sum-Rate Maximization for Multicell OFDMA Systems","sourcePdf":"tvt-lee-2363476-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.183024S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7268796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"7268796","articleId":"6926855","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926861,"authors":[{"name":"Li Wang","affiliation":["Beijing Key Laboratory of Work Safety Intelligent Monitoring, School of Electronic Engineering, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/7268796/6926861/wang-2363520-small.gif","p":["\nLi Wang (M'14) received the Ph.D. degree from Beijing University of Post and Telecommunications (BUPT), Beijing, China, in 2009.","She is an Associate Professor with the School of Electronic Engineering, BUPT, where she directs the Laboratory of High Performance Computing and Networks.

The social-interaction-based D2D admission policy provides a real-life guideline for practical D2D underlay operation in cellular networks.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2363520","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7268796/06926861.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2363520","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7268796","startPage":"4180","endPage":"4186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Device-to-Device Link Admission Policy Based on Social Interaction Information","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926861","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Device-to-Device Link Admission Policy Based on Social Interaction Information","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926861/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"64","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456554","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6926861/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61201150 and 61372117"},{"fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CIF1321143 and ECCS1307820"},{"fundingName":"Science Technology Innovation Foundation for Young Teachers in BUPT","grantNumber":"2013RC0202"},{"fundingName":"State Major Science and Technology Special Projects of China","grantNumber":"2012ZX03004001"},{"fundingName":"Beijing Higher Education Young Elite Teacher Project","grantNumber":"YETP0442"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Device-to-Device Link Admission Policy Based on Social Interaction Information","sourcePdf":"tvt-wang-2363520-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.128694S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7268796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7268796","articleId":"6926861","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6926865,"authors":[{"name":"Farhad Yahyaie","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/7161453/6926865/6926865-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Farhad Yahyaie (GS'09) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2008, and the M.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada, in 2010.

The first method involves a direct mathematical mapping of all system equations and inputs into the frequency domain to produce harmonic coefficients that precisely match those produced by a sliding window Fourier decomposition during transient events. Although this approach reproduces the same harmonic coefficients as a sliding window decomposition, it is shown that reconstruction of the time domain waveforms does not match the response of the underlying time domain system during transients. In contrast, a second method has recently been employed by some researchers that does not strictly map all system equations and inputs into the frequency domain, and yet it has been shown to precisely reproduce time domain results during transients. This paper shows that this matching of the time domain transients comes at the expense of introducing spurious dynamics into the associated harmonic domain model, which may not exist in the underlying time domain system. The limitations and implicit assumptions behind these two methods are identified and compared, thus allowing researchers to readily determine which compromises are to be made based on the application in question.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/59/7161453/06926865.pdf","startPage":"2216","endPage":"2224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on

Attempts are focused not only on the impact evaluation of PHEVs on the system technical performance, but also customers' preferences on the charging patterns. PHEVs coordinator agent (PCA) is proposed to run a multiobjective optimization (MO) framework for the optimal charging patterns of PHEVs from the vehicle owners' and system operator's viewpoint. Wind energy utilization for PHEVs charging, energy costs at the hub input layer, and customers' convenience are all taken into account as the optimization objectives. Due to its promising performance in dealing with MO problems, the multiobjective particle swarm optimization method is employed to evaluate the optimization problem. The 2-point estimation method is used to model the existence uncertainties. The proposed framework is applied to the modified IEEE 34-node test system, and the obtained results demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed approach in real-world scenarios.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimized Probabilistic PHEVs Demand Management in the Context of Energy Hubs","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2348918","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel7/61/7064681/06926867.pdf","startPage":"996","endPage":"1006","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2014.2348918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7064681","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926867","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926867/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","displayDocTitle":"Optimized Probabilistic PHEVs Demand Management in the Context of Energy Hubs","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"30","issue":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6926867/","dateOfInsertion":"20 March 2015","publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"15012867","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimized Probabilistic PHEVs Demand Management in the Context of Energy Hubs","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-fotuhifiruzabad-2348918-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.103456S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"7064681","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"75","xplore-issue":"7064681","articleId":"6926867","onlineDate":"16 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6926918,"authors":[{"name":"Paul Wettin","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA","Senior ASIC Design Engineer with Marvell Semiconductor, Boise, ID, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6926885/6926918/wetti-2351577-small.gif","p":["Paul Wettin (S\u201908\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering, both from the Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.","He is a Senior ASIC Design Engineer at Marvell Semiconductor, Boise, ID, USA."]},"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Wettin","id":"37706532400"},{"name":"Ryan Kim","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6926885/6926918/kim-2351577-small.gif","p":["Ryan Kim (S\u201913) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering from the Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA, in 2011, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering."]},"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kim","id":"37085361593"},{"name":"Jacob Murray","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington Statue University, Everett, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6926885/6926918/murra-2351577-small.gif","p":["Jacob Murray (S\u201908\u2013M\u201914) received the B.S. degree in computer engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering, both from the Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.","He is a Clinical Assistant Professor and a Program Coordinator with the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Everett, WA, USA."]},"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Murray","id":"38542720200"},{"name":"Xinmin Yu","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6926885/6926918/yu-2351577-small.gif","p":["Xinmin Yu (S\u201910) received the B.S. degree from Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China, the M.S. degree from the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China, and the Ph.D. degree from the Washington State University, Pullman, WA, USA, in 2002, 2006, and 2014, respectively, all in electrical engineering."]},"firstName":"Xinmin","lastName":"Yu","id":"37539447700"},{"name":"Partha P.

In this paper, we quantify the latency, energy dissipation, and thermal profiles of mSWNoC architectures by incorporating irregular network routing strategies. We demonstrate that the latency, energy dissipation, and thermal profile are affected by the adopted routing methodologies. The overall system performance and thermal profile are governed by the traffic-dependent optimization of the routing methods.

However, ECC techniques can make memory performance severely degraded since incomplete-word write requests lead to inefficient read-to-write (RTW) and write-to-read operations of synchronous dynamic random access memory. In this paper, we propose a memory subsystem efficient for ECC operations. Our key idea is that the RTW operations causing incomplete-word write requests are split and grouped into independent read and write operations, and then the grouped read and write operations are individually scheduled for the optimal memory performance under application constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed ECC-aware memory subsystem achieves 17% shorter memory latency, and 12% higher memory utilization, on average, than the latest conventional memory subsystems on industrial multimedia applications. Moreover, the ECC-aware memory subsystem improves up to 2.5 times higher memory performance on synthetic benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2014.2351494","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2014.2351494","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6926885/06926923.pdf","startPage":"1706","endPage":"1717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926923/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Error-Correcting Code Aware Memory Subsystem","volume":"33","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14682515","htmlLink":"/document/6926923/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF)"},{"fundingName":"Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning","grantNumber":"2014R1A1A1002262"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error-Correcting Code Aware Memory Subsystem","sourcePdf":"tcad-jang-2351494-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.061474S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6926885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6926885","articleId":"6926923","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926924,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel T.

The evaluations on STT-RAM design metrics and robustness often require a hybrid simulation flow, i.e., modeling the CMOS and magnetic devices with SPICE and macro-magnetic models, respectively. Very often, such a hybrid simulation flow involves expensive Monte Carlo simulations when the design and behavioral variabilities of STT-RAM are taken into account. In this paper, we propose a fast and scalable semi-analytical method-PS3-RAM, enabling efficient statistical simulations in STT-RAM designs. By eliminating the costly macro-magnetic and SPICE simulations, PS3-RAM achieves more than 100\\(000\\boldsymbol {\\times }\\) runtime speedup with excellent agreement with the result of conventional simulation method. PS3-RAM can also accurately estimate the STT-RAM write error rate and write energy distributions at both magnetic tunneling junction switching directions under different temperatures, demonstrating great potential in the analysis of STT-RAM reliability and write energy at the early design stage of memory or micro-architecture.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2014.2351581","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6926885/06926927.pdf","startPage":"1644","endPage":"1656","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2014.2351581","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PS3-RAM: A Fast Portable and Scalable Statistical STT-RAM Reliability/Energy Analysis Method","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","displayDocTitle":"PS3-RAM: A Fast Portable and Scalable Statistical STT-RAM Reliability/Energy Analysis Method","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6926927/","accessionNumber":"14682517","volume":"33","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1217947"},{"fundingName":"49th Design Automation Conference A.

In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy matching model which extracts appropriate feature vectors of hotspot and nonhotspot patterns. Our model can dynamically tune appropriate fuzzy regions around known hotspots. Based on this paper, we develop a fast algorithm for lithography hotspot detection with high accuracy of detection and low probability of false-alarm counts. In addition, since higher dimensional size of feature vectors can produce better accuracy but requires longer run time, this paper proposes a grid reduction technique to significantly reduce the CPU run time with very minor impact on the advantages of higher dimensional space. Our results are very encouraging, with average 94.5% accuracy and low false-alarm counts on a set of test benchmarks.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2014.2351273","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6926885/06926928.pdf","startPage":"1671","endPage":"1680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2014.2351273","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926885","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fuzzy-Matching Model With Grid Reduction for Lithography Hotspot Detection","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6926928","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926928/","displayDocTitle":"A Fuzzy-Matching Model With Grid Reduction for Lithography Hotspot Detection","volume":"33","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14682521","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926928/","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fuzzy-Matching Model With Grid Reduction for Lithography Hotspot Detection","sourcePdf":"tcad-wen-2351273-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071531S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6926885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"6926885","articleId":"6926928","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6926929,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Wang","affiliation":["Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Popular High Performance Computers, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China","Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/43/6926885/6926929/wang-2347929-small.gif","p":["Yi Wang received the B.E. and M.E. degrees in electrical engineering from the Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China, in 2005 and 2008, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, in 2011.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the College of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.

NAND flash memory is normally used to store the file system metadata and page mapping information. Thus, a broken physical page containing metadata may cause an unintended and severe change in functionality of the entire flash. This paper presents Meta-Cure, a novel hardware and file system interface that transparently protects metadata in the presence of multibit faults. Meta-Cure exploits built-in ECC and replication in order to protect pages containing critical data, such as file system metadata. Redundant pairs are formed at run time and distributed to different physical pages to protect against failures. Meta-Cure requires no changes to the file system, on-chip hierarchy, or hardware implementation of flash memory chip. We evaluate Meta-Cure under a real-embedded platform using a variety of I/O traces. The evaluation platform adopts dual ARM Cortex A9 processor cores with 64 Gb NAND flash memory. We have evaluated the effectiveness of Meta-Cure on the new technology file system file system. Experimental results show that the proposed technique can reduce uncorrectable page errors by 70.38% with less than 7.86% time overhead in comparison with conventional error correction techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TCAD.2014.2347929","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926885","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCAD.2014.2347929","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/43/6926885/06926929.pdf","startPage":"1623","endPage":"1631","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reliability-Aware Address Mapping Strategy for NAND Flash Memory Storage Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Reliability-Aware Address Mapping Strategy for NAND Flash Memory Storage Systems","volume":"33","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"16 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6926929/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14682526","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6926929/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"NSF (Variability Expedition)","grantNumber":"CCF-1029783"},{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China","grantNumber":"GRF 15213814"},{"fundingName":"Germany/Hong Kong Joint Research Scheme sponsored by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong and the Germany Academic Exchange Service of Germany","grantNumber":"G_HK021/12"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61272103 and 61373049"},{"fundingName":"National 863 Program","grantNumber":"2013AA013202"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100004377","fundingName":"Hong Kong Polytechnic University","grantNumber":"4-ZZD7, G-YK24, G-YM10 and G-YN36"},{"fundingName":"Academician Workstation Construction Projects in Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"2012B090500020"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reliability-Aware Address Mapping Strategy for NAND Flash Memory Storage Systems","sourcePdf":"tcad-wang-2347929-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.099849S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"43","isNumber":"6926885","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6926885","articleId":"6926929","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927045,"authors":[{"name":"Wilson A.

This problem is known to be NP-hard, and many techniques have been proposed to solve it, such as heuristics, genetic algorithms (GA), and, more recently, particle swarm optimization (PSO). This article aims to use PSO to solve grid scheduling problems, and compare it with other techniques. It is shown that many often-overlooked implementation details can have a huge impact on the performance of the method. In addition, experiments also show that the PSO has a tendency to stagnate around local minima in high-dimensional input problems. Therefore, this work also proposes a novel hybrid PSO-GA method that aims to increase swarm diversity when a stagnation condition is detected. The method is evaluated and compared with other PSO formulations, the results show that the new method can successfully improve the scheduling solution.","doi":"10.1109/WETICE.2014.26","startPage":"173","endPage":"178","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd International WETICE Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WETICE.2014.26","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6926989","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE 23rd International WETICE Conference","pdfPath":"/iel7/6909389/6926989/06927045.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evaluation of Particle Swarm Optimization Applied to Grid Scheduling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927045/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Evaluation of Particle Swarm Optimization Applied to Grid Scheduling","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927045/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14686551","publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"23-25 June 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"23-25 June 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evaluation of Particle Swarm Optimization Applied to Grid Scheduling","confLoc":"Parma, Italy","sourcePdf":"4249a173.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.119572S","chronDate":"23-25 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6909389","isNumber":"6926989","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6909389","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6926989","articleId":"6927045","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927082,"authors":[{"name":"Gianmario Motta","affiliation":["Dept. of Industrial and Information Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianmario","lastName":"Motta","id":"37543044800"},{"name":"Linlin You","affiliation":["Dept. of Industrial and Information Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Linlin","lastName":"You","id":"37074960000"},{"name":"Nicola Sfondrini","affiliation":["Bip. - Business Integration Partners, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Nicola","lastName":"Sfondrini","id":"38252634500"},{"name":"Daniele Sacco","affiliation":["Dept. of Industrial and Information Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Daniele","lastName":"Sacco","id":"38252514300"},{"name":"Tianyi Ma","affiliation":["Dept. of Industrial and Information Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy"],"firstName":"Tianyi","lastName":"Ma","id":"37085469046"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4249-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1524-4547"}],"articleNumber":"6927082","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":211},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monitoring","Contracts","Quality of service","Cloud computing","Engines","Measurement","Generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","contracts","quality of service"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["service level management","cloud computing","third party SLM framework","quality of service","QoS","cloud service provider","cloud service registration agent","negotiation agent","compensation agent","comment agent","billing agent","service monitoring engine"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cloud Computing","Service Level Management","Third-party SLM framework","Service Level Agreement","Quality of Service"]}],"abstract":"The key issue in cloud computing in enterprises is the management of the Quality of Service (QoS), by an appropriate SLM (Service Level Management).

However STT-MRAM faces severe reliability challenges because of its intrinsic physical characteristics and the continuously scaling technology process. Thereby multi-bit error correction codes are considered indispensable techniques for STT-MRAM chips. Furthermore, considering the fact that STT-MRAM targets mainly to replace SRAM or (and) DRAM to be used as a working memory in the cache, main memory and embedded applications etc, high access speed is one of the most critical performance. In this paper, we propose to employ the one-step majority-logic-decodable (OS-MLD) codes to protect the STT-MRAM chips from failures. Their multi-bit error correction capabilities and simple encoding/decoding operations can enable STT-MRAM to be a reliable and high speed working memory. In addition, the optimized parallel decoder implementation of the OS-MLD codes accelerates further the decoding speed with little hardware overhead. A hybrid circuit with the DS(21,11) code and the STT-MRAM cell array has been implemented as a case study in the 28 nm technology node to illustrate the performance of the OS-MLD codes for STT-MRAM.","doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2014.6927189","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory Systems and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory Systems and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917615/6927186/06927189.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2014.6927189","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"One-step majority-logic-decodable codes enable STT-MRAM for high speed working memories","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-21 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927189/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"One-step majority-logic-decodable codes enable STT-MRAM for high speed working memories","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927189/","accessionNumber":"14694958","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"One-step majority-logic-decodable codes enable STT-MRAM for high speed working memories","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"1Kang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083489S","chronDate":"20-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917615","isNumber":"6927186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917615","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6927186","articleId":"6927189","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927191,"authors":[{"name":"Bing Li","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Bing","lastName":"Li","id":"37085443430"},{"name":"Yu Hu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Hu","id":"37277445400"},{"name":"Xiaowei Li","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Computer Architecture, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Xiaowei","lastName":"Li","id":"37280862300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5576-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927191","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":364},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927191","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase change materials","Resistance","Random access memory","Reliability","Acceleration","System performance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["DRAM chips","phase change memories","reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["short-SET write scheme","SET pulse","multilevel cell phase change memory","MLC PCM","DRAM technology","iterative write scheme","reliability degradation","pulse time factor"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2014.6927191","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory Systems and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory Systems and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917615/6927186/06927191.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2014.6927191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Short-SET: An energy-efficient write scheme for MLC PCM","abstract":"Phase change memory (PCM) has many advantages over the traditional DRAM technology, hence it becomes a promising candidate for main memory. Multi-level cell (MLC) PCM has the benefits of higher capacity and lower cost-per-bit due to store multiple bits in a single cell. However, MLC PCM employs an iterative write scheme, which is precise, reliable but slow, incurring adverse impact on the system performance. In this work, we analyzed the characteristics of the SET pulse in PCM, and modeled the relationship of the resistance and the SET pulse in MLC. Based on the analysis, we proposed a short SET pulse as an iterative pulse for MLC, so as to accelerate the MLC PCM write operation without the reliability degradation.

However, it is more expensive than flash memory, and thus introduces a more serious storage capacity issue in low-cost solutions. This issue is further exacerbated by the fact that existing file systems are usually designed to trade space utilization for performance over block-oriented storage devices. In this work, we propose a multi-grained block management scheme to optimize the space utilization of file systems on PCM-based storage systems. By utilizing the byte-addressability and fast read/write feature of PCM, a methodology is proposed to dynamically allocate multiple sizes of blocks to fit the size of each file, so as to resolve the space fragmentation issue with minimized space and management overheads. A series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed scheme, and the results show that the proposed scheme could significantly improve the space utilization of file systems.","doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2014.6927203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927186","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2014.6927203","endPage":"6","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory Systems and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory Systems and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917615/6927186/06927203.pdf","startPage":"1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimizing space utilization of file systems on PCM-based storage devices","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"20-21 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927203/","displayDocTitle":"Optimizing space utilization of file systems on PCM-based storage devices","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"20-21 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14694961","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927203/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimizing space utilization of file systems on PCM-based storage devices","confLoc":"Chongqing, China","sourcePdf":"invitedNVMSAInvitedPaperChang.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086585S","chronDate":"20-21 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917615","isNumber":"6927186","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917615","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6927186","articleId":"6927203","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927206,"authors":[{"name":"Ismail Bayram","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Ismail","lastName":"Bayram","id":"37085553084"},{"name":"Yiran Chen","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, USA"],"firstName":"Yiran","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281023800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5576-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927206","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":506},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927206","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Magnetic tunneling","Transistors","Memristors","Resistance","Nonvolatile memory","Tunneling magnetoresistance","Random access memory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["content-addressable storage","ferroelectric storage","memristors","random-access storage"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["NV-TCAM","NVM designs","ternary content addressable memory","nonvolatile TCAM cells","eNVM technologies","emerging nonvolatile memories","magnetic tunneling junction","memristor","ferroelectric memory field effect transistor","MTJ","FeMFET","close-to-zero standby power"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ferroelectric","spin torque transfer","memristor","tcam","MTJ","FeMFET"]}],"doi":"10.1109/NVMSA.2014.6927206","endPage":"6","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory Systems and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Non-Volatile Memory Systems and Applications Symposium (NVMSA)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917615/6927186/06927206.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/NVMSA.2014.6927206","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927186","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NV-TCAM: Alternative interests and practices in NVM designs","abstract":"TCAM (ternary content addressable memory) is a special memory type that can compare input search data with stored data, and return location (sometime, the associated content) of matched data.

In this paper, we analyze the architecture of the non-volatile memory emulator, focusing mainly on the NAND Flash case, we present details about its internal functionality and, using experimental results, we demonstrate the high accuracy achieved when it is used to emulate a specific NAND Flash chip.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.56","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927220.pdf","startPage":"9","endPage":"15","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Versatile Emulator for the Aging Effect of Non-volatile Memories: The Case of NAND Flash","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Versatile Emulator for the Aging Effect of Non-volatile Memories: The Case of NAND Flash","isConference":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927220/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695394","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927220/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Versatile Emulator for the Aging Effect of Non-volatile Memories: The Case of NAND Flash","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.092709S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927220","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6927223,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Zompakis","affiliation":["ECE School, National Technical University of Athens, Zografou, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Zompakis","id":"37831162700"},{"name":"Iason Filippopoulos","affiliation":["IET Department, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Iason","lastName":"Filippopoulos","id":"37085343606"},{"name":"Per Gunnar Kjeldsberg","affiliation":["IET Department, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway"],"firstName":"Per Gunnar","lastName":"Kjeldsberg","id":"37266049800"},{"name":"Francky Catthoor","affiliation":["vzw, IMEC, Heverlee, Belgium"],"firstName":"Francky","lastName":"Catthoor","id":"37068445400"},{"name":"Dimitrios Soudris","affiliation":["ECE School, National Technical University of Athens, Zografou, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Soudris","id":"37078958600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5793-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927223","dbTime":"17 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927223","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","Switches","Wireless communication","Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth","Modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IEEE standards","power aware computing","telecommunication power management","wireless channels","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["power-aware scenarios","IEEE 802.11ac WLAN systems","power management","transmitting wireless system","system scenarios","communication channel","protocol requirements","transmission signal power","memory subsystem","antenna signal power","active memory banks","system models","switching cost","wireless local area networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["wlan","802.11ac","power management","antenna signal","reconfigurable","memory"]}],"doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.76","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927223.pdf","startPage":"28","endPage":"35","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.76","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Systematic Exploration of Power-Aware Scenarios for IEEE 802.11ac WLAN Systems","abstract":"This work explores the power management options for a transmitting wireless system using system scenarios.

Speedups can be obtained by using specialized hardware in conjunction with the processors. FPGA based accelerators are known to be effective for reducing the execution time of many scientific applications. Since FPGAs are configurable, they can be customized to implement a variety of processing elements as accelerators. The process of mapping algorithm to architecture is complex, as the design space is large. System simulation is usually employed to carry out the exploration, in spite of the fact that simulation models take significantly large amount of time to execute. High level design space exploration helps in taking the required decisions to arrive at an optimal design. In this paper we describe design space exploration carried out for accelerating de novo genome assembly using FPGAs. Three models at various levels of abstraction were used. We discuss how the simulation time of these models influence the choice of design parameters at different levels of abstraction. We illustrate this process by using the high level models to evaluate Hard Embedded Blocks (HEBs) in FPGAs for accelerating the de novo genome assembly application.","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","startPage":"66","endPage":"73","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.95","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.95","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927228.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High Level Design Approach to Accelerate De Novo Genome Assembly Using FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927228/","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"High Level Design Approach to Accelerate De Novo Genome Assembly Using FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695328","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927228/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High Level Design Approach to Accelerate De Novo Genome Assembly Using FPGAs","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a066.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064474S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927228","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927229,"authors":[{"name":"\u00c9ricles Sousa","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"\u00c9ricles","lastName":"Sousa","id":"38252943400"},{"name":"Deepak Gangadharan","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Deepak","lastName":"Gangadharan","id":"37860517500"},{"name":"Frank Hannig","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Frank","lastName":"Hannig","id":"37266978900"},{"name":"Juergen Teich","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Juergen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37334343700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5793-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927229","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":166},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Runtime Reconfigurable Bus Arbitration for Concurrent Applications on Heterogeneous MPSoC Architectures","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927229.pdf","startPage":"74","endPage":"81","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.105","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.105","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Software","Time division multiple access","Computer architecture","Runtime","System-on-chip","Real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrency control","system-on-chip","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["concurrent applications","heterogeneous MPSoC architectures","runtime reconfigurable bus arbitration technique","hardware/software approach","runtime framework","hardware cost evaluation","SPARC V8 architecture","fixed-priority arbitration","reconfigurable arbiter","LUTs","slices registers","reconfiguration overhead","new time slot programming","mixed hard/soft real-time scenario","timeliness requirements","reconfiguring the arbiter","time slots","TDMA","soft real-time algorithm","real-time applications"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Runtime","Reconfigurable Bus Arbitration","Concurrent Applications","Heterogeneous MPSoC Architectures"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927229","abstract":"This paper describes a runtime reconfigurable bus arbitration technique for concurrent applications on heterogeneous MPSoC architectures. Here, a hardware/software approach is introduced as part of a runtime framework that enables selecting and adapting different policies (i. e., fixed-priority, TDMA, and Round-Robin) such that the performance goals of concurrent applications can be satisfied. To evaluate the hardware cost, we compare our proposed solution with respect to a well-known SPARC V8 architecture supporting fixed-priority arbitration. Notably, even providing the flexibility for selecting up to three different policies, our reconfigurable arbiter needs only 25% and 7% more LUTs and slices registers, respectively. The reconfiguration overhead for changing between different policies is 56 cycles and for programming new time slots, only 28 cycles are necessary. For demonstrating the benefits of this reconfiguration framework, we setup a mixed hard/soft real-time scenario by considering four applications with different timeliness requirements. The experimental results show that by reconfiguring the arbiter, less processing elements can be used for achieving a specific target frame rate. Moreover, adjusting the time slots for TDMA, we can speedup a soft real-time algorithm while still satisfying the deadline for hard real-time applications.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927229/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695361","htmlLink":"/document/6927229/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Runtime Reconfigurable Bus Arbitration for Concurrent Applications on Heterogeneous MPSoC Architectures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Runtime Reconfigurable Bus Arbitration for Concurrent Applications on Heterogeneous MPSoC Architectures","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a074.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040172S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927229","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927231,"authors":[{"name":"Luis Araneda","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Center for Optics and Photonics University of Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile"],"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Araneda","id":"37085540697"},{"name":"Miguel Figueroa","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Center for Optics and Photonics University of Concepci\u00f3n, Concepci\u00f3n, Chile"],"firstName":"Miguel","lastName":"Figueroa","id":"38482957200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5793-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927231","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":484},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Cameras","Motion estimation","Hardware","Streaming media","Measurement","Jitter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","filtering theory","motion estimation","video signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["realtime digital video stabilization","field programmable gate array","hardware architecture","high-performance embedded systems","video stabilization algorithm","motion estimation vector","intentional panning","video frame correction","motion filtering","motion correction","Xilinx Spartan-6 LX45 FPGA","infrared camera","power 24.16 mW","frequency 100 MHz"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["digital image stabilization","embedded systems","video processing","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"We present a hardware architecture for real-time digital video stabilization in high-performance embedded systems.

The experimental results obtained show the feasibility of this approach and the improvement in the signal modulator oversampling ratio, enabling higher bandwidth in all-digital transmitters.","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927248.pdf","startPage":"222","endPage":"227","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.70","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Gigasample Time-Interleaved Delta-Sigma Modulator for FPGA-Based All-Digital Transmitters","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Gigasample Time-Interleaved Delta-Sigma Modulator for FPGA-Based All-Digital Transmitters","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927248/","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927248/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695392","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Gigasample Time-Interleaved Delta-Sigma Modulator for FPGA-Based All-Digital Transmitters","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a222.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073934S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927248","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927265,"authors":[{"name":"Pai-Shun Ting","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"Pai-Shun","lastName":"Ting","id":"37085558946"},{"name":"John Patrick Hayes","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"firstName":"John Patrick","lastName":"Hayes","id":"37275743400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5793-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927265","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":921},"abstract":"Stochastic computing (SC) is a re-emerging technique to process probability data encoded in digital bit-streams. Its main advantage is that arithmetic operations can be implemented by extremely small and low-power logic circuits. This makes SC suitable for signal-processing applications involving matrix operations whose VLSI implementation is very costly. Previous SC approaches only address basic matrix operations with relatively low accuracy needs. We explore the use of SC to implement a representative complex matrix operation, namely eigenvector computation. We apply it to a training task for visual face recognition, and show that our SC design has performance comparable to its conventional binary counterpart, while being able to trade computation time for accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System

such as payment or access control. For this purpose, Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC) is commonly used hardware integrated in resource constrained applications in order to provide authenticity and data integrity. On the one hand, specialized crypto hardware approaches provide good performance and consume low power. On the other hand, they often lack flexibility, caused, for example, by hardware integrated protocols and cryptographic parameters. Here we present a flexible and lightweight ECC-based authentication solution that takes into account resource constrained systems. This technique permits to shift parts of the computational intense ECC calculations from the resource constrained device to the authentication terminal. By employing a security controller with a small multi-purpose hardware acceleration core, high computation speed is achieved and a maximum level of flexibility is maintained at the same time. We demonstrate the feasible implementation of the proposed technique by means of an Android-based reader / smart card system, which represent a prime example of contemporary power-constrained and performance-constrained embedded systems. An ECC-based authentication can be carried out on average within 25 ms and checked against a back-end server within 66 ms in a secured manner. Thus, a secured and flexible one-way authentication system is given that shows high performance. This solution can be utilized in a wide variety of application fields, such as anti-counterfeiting, where flexibility and low chip prices are essential.","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927267.pdf","startPage":"372","endPage":"378","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Flexible and Lightweight ECC-Based Authentication Solution for Resource Constrained Systems","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.77","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.77","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927267","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927267/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Flexible and Lightweight ECC-Based Authentication Solution for Resource Constrained Systems","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695319","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927267/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Flexible and Lightweight ECC-Based Authentication Solution for Resource Constrained Systems","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108055S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927267","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927269,"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Hiller","affiliation":["Institute for Security in Information Technology Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Matthias","lastName":"Hiller","id":"38248194200"},{"name":"Leandro Rodrigues Lima","affiliation":["Institute for Security in Information Technology Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Leandro Rodrigues","lastName":"Lima","id":"37085386977"},{"name":"Georg Sigl","affiliation":["Institute for Security in Information Technology Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Munich, Germany"],"firstName":"Georg","lastName":"Sigl","id":"37389947600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5793-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927269","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":247},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Decoding","Convolutional codes","Viterbi algorithm","Computer architecture","Registers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","field programmable gate arrays","private key cryptography","public key cryptography","random-access storage","Viterbi decoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["area-optimized FPGA Viterbi decoder","PUF","physical unclonable functions","security primitives","cryptographic keys","Seesaw architecture","custom low-area data path","alternating data access patterns","data handling complexity reduction","block RAM","convolutional code"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)","Error Correction","Convolutional Code","Viterbi Algorithm","VLSI","FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Physical Unclonable Functions PUFs are popular security primitives to provide cryptographic keys on FPGAs. However, PUFs require error correction to create reliable cryptographic keys. This work presents a highly optimized Viterbi decoder, adapted to the constraints of PUFs on FPGAs, primarily area but also low power. Our Seesaw architecture contains two block RAMs that are connected through a custom low-area data path. As main result, alternating data access patterns reduce the complexity of the data handling in the Viterbi decoder. Instead of translating through the entire trellis, we introduce a method that only operates on the last state. The new access pattern permits to store the intermediate results in block RAM and leads to a compact overall footprint with low register count. Synthesis results for one legacy and one state-of-the art FPGA, and a comparison to state-of-the-art implementations demonstrate the efficiency of our new Seesaw architecture.

They represent a direct generalization of SOP forms, obtained generalizing cubes to \"2-pseudocubes\" where literals in cubes may be replaced by 2-EXOR factors in 2-pseudocubes. We discuss and experimentally evaluate two different measures for the error: the bit threshold and the minterm threshold. The first metric considers the overall number of complemented output bits, while the second metric is related to the number of input vectors on which the output computed by the circuit is different from the exact one on at least one bit. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. For an error rate threshold of 1%, our heuristic for approximate 2-SPP synthesis provides an average reduction of the number of 2-pseudocubes in the cover of about 23% for all the considered benchmarks, when we consider the bit threshold error metric. The reduction in the number of 2-pseudocubes is interesting even in the minterm threshold error metric, especially when we perform the resynthesis of the derived approximate versions of the benchmarks: the average gain, without resynthesis is of about 8%, while the average gain with resynthesis becomes 15%.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927272","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error analysis","Measurement","Minimization","Boolean functions","Logic gates","Vectors","Benchmark testing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["logic design","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["2-SPP approximate synthesis","error tolerant application","approximate logic synthesis heuristic","three-level EXOR-AND-OR form","EXOR gates","2-pseudocubes","bit threshold","minterm threshold"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["2-SPP synthesis","approximate synthesis"]}],"publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927272.pdf","startPage":"411","endPage":"418","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.21","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.21","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"2-SPP Approximate Synthesis for Error Tolerant Applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927272/","displayDocTitle":"2-SPP Approximate Synthesis for Error Tolerant Applications","isDynamicHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695401","htmlLink":"/document/6927272/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"2-SPP Approximate Synthesis for Error Tolerant Applications","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a411.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099862S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927272","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6927277,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew M.

A bottom-up approach has been employed: SPICE simulations have been used to derive higher level error models implemented using Verilog HDL. HSPICE Monte-Carlo simulations show that the delay dependent probabilistic nature of these faults is due to the process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations which affect the circuits operating at very low supply voltages. For gate level error analysis, mutant based simulated fault injection (SFI) techniques have been employed for combinational net list reliability analysis. Four types of gate level fault models, with different accuracies, are proposed. Our findings show that the proposed SFI method presents a 2X-5X simulation time overhead compared to the simulation of the gold circuit, with respect to SPICE analysis, the proposed method requires three orders of magnitude less simulation time.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.92","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927280.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.92","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","startPage":"473","endPage":"479","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Probabilistic Gate Level Fault Modeling for Near and Sub-Threshold CMOS Circuits","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927280","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Probabilistic Gate Level Fault Modeling for Near and Sub-Threshold CMOS Circuits","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927280/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695335","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927280/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Probabilistic Gate Level Fault Modeling for Near and Sub-Threshold CMOS Circuits","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a473.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.090148S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927280","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6927283,"authors":[{"name":"Sergei Dytckov","affiliation":["University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Sergei","lastName":"Dytckov","id":"37085413315"},{"name":"Masoud Daneshtalab","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden","University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Masoud","lastName":"Daneshtalab","id":"37298922900"},{"name":"Masoumeh Ebrahimi","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden","University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Masoumeh","lastName":"Ebrahimi","id":"37398164600"},{"name":"Hassan Anwar","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique Montreal, Canada"],"firstName":"Hassan","lastName":"Anwar","id":"37085442954"},{"name":"Juha Plosila","affiliation":["University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Juha","lastName":"Plosila","id":"37065307000"},{"name":"Hannu Tenhunen","affiliation":["KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden","University of Turku, Finland"],"firstName":"Hannu","lastName":"Tenhunen","id":"37085334517"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5793-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927283","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":289},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neurons","Biological system modeling","Neural networks","Mathematical model","Power demand","Integrated circuit interconnections"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","network routing","network-on-chip","neural nets","neurophysiology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["STDP microarchitecture","silicon spiking neural networks","biological neurons","massively parallel computational systems","network-on-chip","scalability-throughput-neuron-router ratio trade-off","optimal cluster size","lowest area overhead","power consumption","spike timing dependent plasticity"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Spiking Neural Network","Networks-on-Chip","STDP","Neuron Clustering"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient STDP Micro-Architecture for Silicon Spiking Neural Networks","abstract":"Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are the closest approach to biological neurons in comparison with conventional artificial neural networks (ANN). SNNs are composed of neurons and synapses which are interconnected with a complex pattern. As communication in such massively parallel computational systems is getting critical, the network-on-chip (NoC) becomes a promising solution to provide a scalable and robust interconnection fabric. However, using NoC for large-scale SNNs arises a trade-off between scalability, throughput, neuron/router ratio (cluster size), and area overhead. In this paper, we tackle the trade-off using a clustering approach and try to optimize the synaptic resource utilization. An optimal cluster size can provide the lowest area overhead and power consumption. For the learning purposes, a phenomenon known as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is utilized. The micro-architectures of the network, clusters, and the computational neurons are also described. The presented approach suggests a promising solution of integrating NoCs and STDP-based SNNs for the optimal performance based on the underlying application.","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927283","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927283.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.109","startPage":"496","endPage":"503","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.109","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927283/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Efficient STDP Micro-Architecture for Silicon Spiking Neural Networks","isDynamicHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927283/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695329","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient STDP Micro-Architecture for Silicon Spiking Neural Networks","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a496.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.09039S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927283","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6927286,"authors":[{"name":"Partha De","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Partha","lastName":"De","id":"37076456300"},{"name":"Kunal Banerjee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Kunal","lastName":"Banerjee","id":"37956078800"},{"name":"Chittaranjan Mandal","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Chittaranjan","lastName":"Mandal","id":"37298370300"},{"name":"Debdeep Mukhopadhyay","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, India"],"firstName":"Debdeep","lastName":"Mukhopadhyay","id":"37411288700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5793-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927286","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Circuits and Synthesis Mechanism for Hardware Design to Counter Power Analysis Attacks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Boolean functions","Data structures","Transistors","Logic gates","Resistance","Power demand","Inverters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["binary decision diagrams","cryptography","logic circuits","logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware design","cryptographic algorithm","power trace","current trace","PAAs","binary decision diagram","dual-rail logic circuit scheme","precharge generation","voltage scaling","leakage power minimization","propagation effect resistance mechanism","synthesis algorithm","Boolean functions","BDD based circuits","circuit synthesis","peak power variation","elementary gates","NOT","XOR","NAND","NOR","Lucifer","S-boxes","differential power analysis attack","correlation power analysis attack","size 65 nm"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Side channel attack","Power analysis attack","Binary Decision Diagram","Early propagation effect","Voltage scaling"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927286","abstract":"Execution of cryptographic algorithm in hardware or software usually leaves power/current traces that are dependent on the data being processed. Power analysis attacks (PAAs) have been found to be extremely effective on such systems to derive the cryptographic secrets from these traces. Therefore, countering PAAs is of great importance. In this work, a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) based dual-rail logic circuit scheme has been developed to counter PAAs. This circuit scheme features novel pre-charge generation, voltage scaling with leakage power minimization and early propagation effect resistance mechanism. A simple synthesis algorithm for mapping given Boolean functions to such BDD based circuits is also presented. The synthesized circuits feature low power circuitry and extremely low peak power variation. Experimental results for elementary gates such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR and the Lucifer and the Present S-boxes highlight the advantages of circuits based on this scheme with respect to peak power variance, average power and average current when compared with two other techniques - DP-BDD and SDMLp. Resistance of our S-box implementations to strong differential power analysis and correlation power analysis attacks have also been experimentally demonstrated. All results have been obtained using 65nm technology.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.61","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927286.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.61","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","startPage":"520","endPage":"527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Circuits and Synthesis Mechanism for Hardware Design to Counter Power Analysis Attacks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927286/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14695346","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927286/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Circuits and Synthesis Mechanism for Hardware Design to Counter Power Analysis Attacks","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a520.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.114815S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927286","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927289,"authors":[{"name":"Maryam Hemmati","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Maryam","lastName":"Hemmati","id":"37085519747"},{"name":"Morteza Biglari-Abhari","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Morteza","lastName":"Biglari-Abhari","id":"38270879300"},{"name":"Stevan Berber","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Auckland Auckland, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Stevan","lastName":"Berber","id":"37266150700"},{"name":"Smail Niar","affiliation":["Institut des Sciences et Techniques de Valenciennes University of Valenciennes and Hainaut-Cambresis Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Smail","lastName":"Niar","id":"37298902900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5793-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927289","dbTime":"23 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":683},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Hardware","Histograms","Computer architecture","Real-time systems","Support vector machines","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feature extraction","object detection","parallel architectures","pedestrians","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HOG feature extractor hardware accelerator","histogram of oriented gradients","real-time pedestrian detection","parallel architecture","memory access pattern","support vector machine","SVM classifier","object detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time pedestrian detection","FPGA hardware accelerator","HOG"]}],"abstract":"Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is considered as the most promising algorithm in human detection, however its complexity and intensive computational load is an issue for real-time detection in embedded systems. This paper presents a hardware accelerator for HOG feature extractor to fulfill the requirements of real-time pedestrian detection in driver assistance systems. Parallel and deep pipelined hardware architecture with special defined memory access pattern is employed to improve the throughput while maintaining the accuracy of the original algorithm reasonably high. Adoption of efficient memory access pattern, which provides simultaneous access to the required memory area for different functional blocks, avoids repetitive calculation at different stages of computation, resulting in both higher throughput and lower power. It does not impose any further resource requirements with regard to memory utilization.

While nanometer feature sizes allow denser chip designs in each technology generation, fabricated ICs become more susceptible to wear-outs, causing operation failure. Even a single link failure within an on-chip fabric can halt communication between application blocks, which makes the entire chip useless. In this study, we aim to make faulty chips designed with Network-on-Chip (NoC) communication usable. Specifically, we present a fault-tolerant irregular topology generation method for application specific NoC designs. Designed NoC topology allows a different routing path if there is a link failure on the default routing. We compare fault-tolerant topologies with regular fault-tolerant ring topologies, and non-fault-tolerant application specific irregular topologies on energy consumption, performance, and area using multimedia benchmarks and custom-generated graphs.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.13","startPage":"631","endPage":"634","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927300.pdf","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.13","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Irregular Topology Design Method for Network-on-Chips","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Topology","Network topology","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems","Ports (Computers)","Energy consumption","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit manufacture","integrated circuit technology","network routing","network topology","network-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault-tolerant irregular topology generation design method","network-on-chip","integrated circuit technology sizes","IC technology sizes","transistor density","nanometer feature sizes","denser chip designs","technology generation","fabricated IC","operation failure","single link failure","on-chip fabric","application blocks","faulty chips design","NoC designs","default routing path","fault-tolerant ring topology","nonfault-tolerant application","energy consumption","multimedia benchmarks","custom-generated graphs"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Network-on-Chip","topology","energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927300/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Fault-Tolerant Irregular Topology Design Method for Network-on-Chips","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927300/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695324","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault-Tolerant Irregular Topology Design Method for Network-on-Chips","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a631.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.035192S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927300","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927303,"authors":[{"name":"Muzaffar Rao","affiliation":["University of Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Muzaffar","lastName":"Rao","id":"37085493365"},{"name":"Thomas Newe","affiliation":["University of Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Newe","id":"37294527000"},{"name":"Ian Grout","affiliation":["University of Limerick, Ireland"],"firstName":"Ian","lastName":"Grout","id":"37282578000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5793-4","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927303","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":308},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927303","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Equations","Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Throughput","Cryptography","Table lookup","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","digital signatures","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["secure hash algorithm-3","Virtex-5 FPGA","cryptographic hash function","message authentication code","MAC","digital signatures","data integrity","SHA-3","cryptographic hash algorithm","National Institute of Standards and Technology","NIST","high speed implementation","field programmable gate array","hardware architecture","Xilinx look-up-table primitives","TPA"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","SHA-3","High Speed Implementation"]}],"abstract":"Cryptographic hash functions have many security based applications, particularly in message authentication codes (MACs), digital signatures and data integrity.

The sensing element of the ReadOut Circuit (ROC) is a voltage-controlled ring oscillator, designed to make the system robust to voltage and temperature variations with a dedicated calibration implemented to eliminate offset when no pressure is applied. The ring oscillator is used at the same time as a sensor and a clock signal for the entire event-driven unit. This, in turn, enables to further reduce the thermal drift of the measured capacitance. The sensitivity is 10 fF per LSB, considering a nominal sensing capacitance of 1 pF.

Given their heterogeneous nature, CPS are naturally designed in the so-called simulation-centric process, where physical equipment design are translated into behavioral simulation models. Although many tools exist to ease the design phase in the different disciplines, their full integration is still an open problem. This fact holds particularly true in a control design perspective, given that in a CPS the \"plant\" has a heterogeneous nature, and the design of model-based, advanced control techniques would strongly benefit from the availability of a common modeling environment. In this paper, we try to enhance this simulation-centric process by introducing a pure simulation kind of prototype, based on the co-simulation of the firmware and of the multi-physical controlled system. We introduce some innovative tools, implemented in \u03bcLab/CfL [1], and discuss upon their impact towards a better collaborative design and integration during the design of CPS.

Unlike traditional charge-based technologies, SWDs use spin as information carrier that propagates in waves. In this scenario, the logic primitive for computation is the majority gate. The majority gate has a greater expressive power than standard NAND/NOR gates, allowing SWD circuits to be more compact than CMOS, already at the logic level. Also, because there is not charge carrier transport, SWDs are estimated to have ultra-low power consumption. However, in order to exploit this opportunity, a native majority synthesis methodology is needed to fit the SWD technology needs. In this paper, we employ Majority-Inverter Graphs (MIGs) to naturally represent and synthesize SWD circuits. Thanks to the correspondence between the functionality of SWD primitive gates and MIG elements, MIG optimization intrinsically aims at minimum cost SWD implementations. Experimental results over MCNC benchmarks validate the efficiency of MIGs in SWD synthesis. As compared to traditional AND-Inverter Graph (AIG) synthesis, MIGs generate, on average, SWD circuits with 1.30X smaller area-delay-power product (ADP), improving their delay performance by 18%.","doi":"10.1109/DSD.2014.99","publicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 17th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923029/6927207/06927315.pdf","startPage":"691","endPage":"694","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DSD.2014.99","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927207","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Majority Logic Synthesis for Spin Wave Technology","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927315/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Majority Logic Synthesis for Spin Wave Technology","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14695317","htmlLink":"/document/6927315/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Majority Logic Synthesis for Spin Wave Technology","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5793a691.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.083704S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923029","isNumber":"6927207","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923029","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6927207","articleId":"6927315","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927378,"authors":[{"name":"Frederik Gr\u00fcll","affiliation":["IRI, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"],"firstName":"Frederik","lastName":"Gr\u00fcll","id":"37398609800"},{"name":"Udo Kebschull","affiliation":["IRI, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany"],"firstName":"Udo","lastName":"Kebschull","id":"37062597800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927378","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":9,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Pipelines","Acceleration","Electron microscopy","Tomography","Optical microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","data flow computing","field programmable gate arrays","image reconstruction","medical image processing","microscopy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biomedical image processing","biomedical image reconstruction","dataflow computing","FPGA","field programmable gate array","localization microscopy","electron tomography","imperative languages","dataflow paradigm","Intel i5 450 CPU","central processing unit","Nvidia Tesla C1060"]}],"abstract":"Increasing chip sizes and better programming tools have made it possible to increase the boundaries of application acceleration with FPGAs.

Split-radix Fast Fourier Transform (SRFFT) approximates the minimum number of multiplications by theory among all the FFT algorithms, therefore SRFFT is a good candidate for the implementation of a low power FFT processor. In this PhD work, we aim to implement a novel low power Split-Radix FFT processor using shared-memory architecture and extend this work to a parallel structure based on FPGA. We started by designing a new radix-2 butterfly unit using clock gating approach to block unnecessary switching activity in the multiplier. Compared to existing SRFFT processors which are based on the \u201cL\u201d shaped butterfly, our implementation simplifies the address generation process for FFT data. Furthermore, because the number of multiplications required by SRFFT algorithm significantly decreases as the FFT size increases, it is reasonable to assume the proposed architecture will save more power when it comes to larger points of FFT.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927379","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927379.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927379","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927379","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of low-power split-radix FFT processors","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927379/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of low-power split-radix FFT processors","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927379/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692916","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of low-power split-radix FFT processors","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"phd02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05403S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927379","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927380,"authors":[{"name":"Thinh H.

However, current works either require a large external memory to store the ECCs or can at most correct only one error in a frame. This paper proposes a novel bit-interleaved embedded hamming scheme along with scrubbing, to correct single (SBUs) and multi-bit upsets (MBUs) in SRAM-based FPGAs.

One of the future challenge is to find a way to use a maximum of defected manufactured circuits. In this paper, multiple techniques are proposed to avoid defects in the cluster local interconnect of a SRAM-based Mesh of Clusters FPGA. Using defect tolerance, area and timing metrics, two previous hardware redundancy strategies are evaluated on the Mesh of Clusters architecture : Fine Grain Redundancy (FGR) and Improved Fine Grain Redundancy (IFGR). We show that using these techniques on a cluster of a Mesh of Clusters architecture permits to tolerate 8 times more defects than on an industrial Mesh FPGA with a low area overhead (-6% for FGR and 22% for IFGR) and a low increase of Critical Path Delay (CPD)(6% for FGR and 2% for IFGR). We also proposed three new redundancy strategies using spare resources : Distributed Feedbacks (DF) for crossbar down, Adapted Fine Grain Redundancy (AFGR) to avoid defective multiplexers and Upward Redundant Multiplexer (URM) for the crossbar up. Compared to the Mesh of Clusters architecture without defect tolerance techniques, the best trade off between defect tolerance (36.4%), area overhead (11.56%) and CPD (+7.46%) is obtained using AFGR. Using the other methods permits to considerably limit the area overhead (10.4% with URM) with a lesser number of defective elements bypassed (18% max).","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927389","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927389.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927389","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927389","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improve defect tolerance in a cluster of a SRAM-based Mesh of Cluster FPGA using hardware redundancy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927389/","displayDocTitle":"Improve defect tolerance in a cluster of a SRAM-based Mesh of Cluster FPGA using hardware redundancy","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927389/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692926","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improve defect tolerance in a cluster of a SRAM-based Mesh of Cluster FPGA using hardware redundancy","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.057651S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927389","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6927390,"authors":[{"name":"Abdulazim Amouri","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Abdulazim","lastName":"Amouri","id":"38494542800"},{"name":"Florent Bruguier","affiliation":["LIRMM, CNRS - University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Florent","lastName":"Bruguier","id":"37897272200"},{"name":"Saman Kiamehr","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Saman","lastName":"Kiamehr","id":"37541746100"},{"name":"Pascal Benoit","affiliation":["LIRMM, CNRS - University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Pascal","lastName":"Benoit","id":"37391893000"},{"name":"Lionel Torres","affiliation":["LIRMM, CNRS - University of Montpellier 2, Montpellier, France"],"firstName":"Lionel","lastName":"Torres","id":"37285662600"},{"name":"Mehdi Tahoori","affiliation":["Institute of Computer Engineering, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Karlsruhe, Germany"],"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Tahoori","id":"37273925100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927390","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":830},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Aging","Stress","Degradation","Transistors","Temperature sensors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ageing","electric sensing devices","field programmable gate arrays","MOSFET","negative bias temperature instability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","controlled ring-oscillator based sensors","Spartan-6 FPGA","internal switching activities","signal probabilities","electromagnetic emissions","BTI aging factor","HCI aging factor","bias temperature instability","hot carrier injection"]}],"abstract":"Modern Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are built using the most advanced technology nodes to meet performance and power demands. This makes them susceptible to various reliability challenges at nano-scale, and in particular to transistor aging. In this paper, an experimental analysis is made to identify the main parameters and phenomena influencing the performance degradation of FPGAs. For that purpose, a set of controlled ring-oscillator-based sensors with different frequencies and tunable activity control are implemented on a Spartan-6 FPGA. Thus, the internal switching activities (SAs) and signal probabilities (SPs) of the sensors can be varied. We performed accelerated-lifetime conditions using elevated temperatures and voltages in a controlled setting to stress the FPGA. A novel monitoring method based on measuring the electromagnetic emissions of the FPGA is used to accurately monitor the performance of the sensors before and after the stress. The experiments reveal the extent of performance degradations, the impact of SPs and SAs, and the relative impacts of BTI and HCI aging factors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Aging effects in FPGAs: an experimental analysis","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927390","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927390.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927390/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Aging effects in FPGAs: an experimental analysis","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927390/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692924","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Aging effects in FPGAs: an experimental analysis","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps108.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048763S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"12","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927391,"authors":[{"name":"Wilson Jos\u00e9","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Universidade de Lisboa, Portuzal"],"firstName":"Wilson","lastName":"Jos\u00e9","id":"38667560400"},{"name":"Ana Rita Silva","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Universidade de Lisboa, Portuzal"],"firstName":"Ana Rita","lastName":"Silva","id":"38667693700"},{"name":"Hor\u00e1cio Neto","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Universidade de Lisboa, Portuzal"],"firstName":"Hor\u00e1cio","lastName":"Neto","id":"37300331900"},{"name":"M\u00e1rio V\u00e9stias","affiliation":["INESC-ID, Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa, IPL, Portugal"],"firstName":"M\u00e1rio","lastName":"V\u00e9stias","id":"37300332700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927391","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":473},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient implementation of a single-precision floating-point arithmetic unit on FPGA","abstract":"This paper presents a single precision floating point arithmetic unit with support for multiplication, addition, fused multiply-add, reciprocal, square-root and inverse square-root with high-performance and low resource usage.

This paper proposes and evaluates a RAM-based anonymization architecture that maintains both high throughput and a low information-loss ratio.","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927400.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927400","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"RAM-based hardware accelerator for network data anonymization","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"RAM-based hardware accelerator for network data anonymization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927400/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927400/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692877","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"RAM-based hardware accelerator for network data anonymization","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps202.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07151S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927401,"authors":[{"name":"Siddhartha","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"lastName":"Siddhartha"},{"name":"Nachiket Kapre","affiliation":["Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore, SG"],"firstName":"Nachiket","lastName":"Kapre"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927401","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":236},"abstract":"FPGA-based token dataflow architectures with heterogeneous computation and communication subsystems can accelerate hard-to-parallelize, irregular computations in sparse LU factorization.

We perform a one-time pre-processing of the sparse matrices in software to generate dataflow graphs that capture raw parallelism in the computation through substitution and reassociation transformations. We customize the dataflow architecture by picking the right mixture of addition and multiplication processing elements to match the observed balance in the dataflow graphs. Additionally, we modify the network-on-chip to route certain critical dependencies on a separate, faster communication channel while relegating less-critical traffic to the existing channels. Using our techniques, we show how to achieve speedups of up to 37% over existing state-of-the-art FPGA-based sparse LU factorization systems that can already run 3-4\u00d7 faster than CPU-based sparse LU solvers using the same hardware constraints.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927401.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927401","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927401","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927401","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heterogeneous dataflow architectures for FPGA-based sparse LU factorization","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Benchmark testing","Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Sparse matrices","Hardware","Parallel processing","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data flow graphs","field programmable gate arrays","matrix decomposition","network-on-chip","reconfigurable architectures","sparse matrices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["heterogeneous dataflow architectures","FPGA-based sparse LU factorization algorithm","FPGA-based token dataflow architectures","heterogeneous computation","communication subsystems","software pre-processing","architecture customization","sparse matrices","dataflow graphs","raw parallelism","multiplication processing elements","network-on-chip","communication channel","CPU-based sparse LU solvers","hardware constraints"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927401/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Heterogeneous dataflow architectures for FPGA-based sparse LU factorization","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927401/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692929","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heterogeneous dataflow architectures for FPGA-based sparse LU factorization","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps203.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061609S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927401","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927402,"authors":[{"name":"Alexandru Amaricai","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Amaricai","id":"37396351700"},{"name":"Constantina-Elena Gavriliu","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Constantina-Elena","lastName":"Gavriliu","id":"37085357031"},{"name":"Oana Boncalo","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Oana","lastName":"Boncalo","id":"37396354200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927402","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":766},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Field programmable gate arrays","Smoothing methods","Buffer storage","Pipelines","Clocks","Image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA sliding window-based architecture","Harris corner detector algorithm","field programmable gate array","sliding processing window","image processing algorithms","feature detection","motion tracking","image registration","external FPGA memory","Virtex5 FPGA","Spartan-6 FPGA","BRAM usage","random access memory"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","corner detection","Harris's algorithm"]}],"abstract":"This paper proposes a FPGA implementation based on sliding processing window for Harris corner algorithm.

We highlight three key challenges in accelerating name lookup using FPGA, and then present a scalable approach to address them. In our approach, a hierarchical and compact data structure is proposed to represent the name trie, which achieves not only effective pipeline mapping but also high memory efficiency. Further, it is finally implemented as a linear pipeline on the FPGA platform, enabling both fast lookup speed and low lookup latency. The experimental results show that our approach gains a reduction of memory cost over 90% compared with the referred GPU-based solution. Besides, the lookup throughput of our approach is almost 2.4 times higher, and the latency is up to 3 orders of magnitude lower.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927403","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927403.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927403","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Accelerate NDN name lookup using FPGA: Challenges and a scalable approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927403","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Accelerate NDN name lookup using FPGA: Challenges and a scalable approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927403/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692876","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927403/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Accelerate NDN name lookup using FPGA: Challenges and a scalable approach","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps205.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.047176S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927403","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927404,"authors":[{"name":"Youkou Sogabe","affiliation":["Systems and Information Engineering, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, JAPAN"],"firstName":"Youkou","lastName":"Sogabe","id":"37085550059"},{"name":"Tsutomu Maruyama","affiliation":["Tsukuba Daigaku, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, JP"],"firstName":"Tsutomu","lastName":"Maruyama","id":"37291753000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927404","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":324},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927404","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bioinformatics","Genomics","Indexes","Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","Acceleration","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","genomics","sorting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","short read mapping","parallel comparison","reference genome","target genome","next generation sequencing","bucket sort","nucleotide substitution","mapping rate","search time"]}],"abstract":"Short read mapping is a process to align the short reads, which are fixed-length fragments of the target genome, to a given reference genome to identify the mutations in the target genome. Because of the rapid development of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, faster short read mapping is required. In this paper, we propose an FPGA system for the short read mapping based on sort and parallel comparison of seeds. Seeds are fixed-length sub-strings in the short reads used to map the short read to the reference genome efficiently. In our system, (1) seeds are sorted using bucket sort, and the seeds in a bucket are compared in parallel with the candidate locations on the reference genome, (2) in this comparison, one nucleotide substitution, insertion, and deletion are allowed to achieve higher mapping rate, and (3) two stage search by reconfiguration is used to achieve higher performance. The mapping rate and search time by this approach outperforms existing systems.","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927404.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927404","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927404","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA acceleration of short read mapping based on sort and parallel comparison","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FPGA acceleration of short read mapping based on sort and parallel comparison","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927404/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927404/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692891","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA acceleration of short read mapping based on sort and parallel comparison","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps206.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04869S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927404","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6927405,"authors":[{"name":"Kenji Kanazawa","affiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Kenji","lastName":"Kanazawa","id":"37299279800"},{"name":"Tsutomu Maruyama","affiliation":["University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan"],"firstName":"Tsutomu","lastName":"Maruyama","id":"37291753000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927405","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":256},"abstract":"WalkSAT (WSAT) is a stochastic local search algorithms for Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) and Maximum Boolean Satisfiability (MaxSAT) problems, and it is very suitable for hardware acceleration because of its high inherent parallelism. Formal verification is one of the most important applications of SAT and MaxSAT, however, the size of the formal verification problems is significantly larger than on-chip memory size, and most of the data have to be placed in off-chip DRAM. In this paper, we propose a method to hide the access delay by using on-chip memory banks as a variable-way associative cache memory. The size of data blocks that are frequently fetched from the DRAM considerably varies in the WSAT algorithm. This cache memory aims to hold whole block when it is small enough, and only the head portion when it is large, to hide the DRAM access delay. With this cache memory, up to 60% DRAM access delay can be hidden, and the performance can be improved up to 26%.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927405.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927405","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927405","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927405","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA acceleration of SAT/Max-SAT solving using variable-way cache","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Delays","Cache memory","Field programmable gate arrays","Parallel processing","Logic gates","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Boolean functions","cache storage","computability","DRAM chips","field programmable gate arrays","formal verification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA acceleration","SAT-Max-SAT","variable-way cache","WalkSAT","stochastic local search algorithms","Boolean satisfiability","hardware acceleration","formal verification","DRAM","access delay","on-chip memory banks","variable-way associative cache memory","WSAT algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927405/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"FPGA acceleration of SAT/Max-SAT solving using variable-way cache","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927405/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692873","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA acceleration of SAT/Max-SAT solving using variable-way cache","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps207.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069363S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927405","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6927406,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Kunz","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Kunz","id":"38491035800"},{"name":"Alexander Ostrowski","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Alexander","lastName":"Ostrowski","id":"37979691800"},{"name":"Peter Zipf","affiliation":["Digital Technology Group, University of Kassel, Kassel, Germany"],"firstName":"Peter","lastName":"Zipf","id":"37273343400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927406","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":404},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical imaging","Hardware","Computer architecture","Kernel","Integrated optics","Real-time systems","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image motion analysis","image sequences","object detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-optimized architecture","schunck optical flow algorithm","horn optical flow algorithm","optical flow estimation","image sequences","motion detection","Stratix IV"]}],"abstract":"Optical flow estimation of image sequences is one of the key elements for motion detection.

The adoption of floating-point solutions for this class of applications is conditioned by area and performance requirements.

It is widely used in a variety of biological analyses including SNP discovery, genotyping and personal genomics. As next-generation DNA sequencing machines are generating an enormous amount of sequence data, it is a good choice to implement the read-mapping algorithm in the MapReduce framework and outsource the computation to the cloud. Data privacy becomes a big concern in this situation as DNA sequences are very sensitive. In response, encryption may be used to protect the data. However, it is very difficult for the cloud to process cipher texts. In the MapReduce framework, even if values (data to be processed) may be protected by encryption, keys cannot be encrypted using sematic secure encryption schemes as it will affect the MapReduce scheduling mechanism. But if no protection is utilized, attackers may extract useful information from unprotected keys. We propose a solution that can securely outsource read-mapping computations in the MapReduce framework by leveraging inherent tamper resistant properties of FPGAs. We also provide a method to protect the keys generated in this process. We implement our solution using FPGAs and apply it to some data sets. The security evaluation and experimental results show that with this method, DNA sequence privacy is well protected, and the extra cost is acceptable.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927414","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927414.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927414","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Privacy preserving large scale DNA read-mapping in MapReduce framework using FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927414/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Privacy preserving large scale DNA read-mapping in MapReduce framework using FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927414/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692858","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Privacy preserving large scale DNA read-mapping in MapReduce framework using FPGAs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps216.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060403S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6927417,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Gallo","affiliation":["University of Naples Federico II, Napoli","Imperial College London, London, U.K"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Gallo","id":"37078363300"},{"name":"Alessandro Cilardo","affiliation":["University of Naples Federico II, Napoli"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Cilardo","id":"37300501900"},{"name":"David Thomas","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, U.K"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Thomas","id":"37289926400"},{"name":"Samuel Bayliss","affiliation":["Imperial College London, London, U.K"],"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Bayliss","id":"37680922800"},{"name":"George A.

Adopting a suitable application-based memory partitioning strategy is thus vital to take full advantage of the memory architecture. In addition to improving the potential memory bandwidth, partitioning also affects the area complexity of the generated system because the required steering logic depends on the partitioning scheme. This work describes the area implications of a lattice-based memory partitioning technique in the context of high-level synthesis for FPGAs. Experimental results with a commercial HLS tool show that the proposed partitioning technique improves area efficiency compared to alternative approaches.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927417.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927417","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927417","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927417","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Area implications of memory partitioning for high-level synthesis on FPGAs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Lattices","Switches","Memory management","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Schedules","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","high level synthesis","memory architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-level synthesis","FPGA","independent memory banks","application-based memory partitioning","memory architecture","steering logic","lattice-based memory partitioning","commercial HLS tool"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927417/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Area implications of memory partitioning for high-level synthesis on FPGAs","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927417/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692834","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Area implications of memory partitioning for high-level synthesis on FPGAs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps303.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06116S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927417","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927418,"authors":[{"name":"Fatemeh Eslami","affiliation":["The University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine, Vancouver, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Fatemeh","lastName":"Eslami"},{"name":"Steven J.E.

However, this approach suffers from the lack of observability during debugging. To enhance observability, designers insert debug instrumentation; trace buffers are used to record a small subset of data. Since these buffers have limited capacity, trigger circuits are required to start and/or stop recording based on the values of selected signals in the circuit. Although it is possible to insert trigger circuits at compile time, changing the trigger behaviour requires re-compiling the design, increasing the cost of each debug iteration. In this paper, we propose inserting trigger circuits at run-time by distributing trigger logic over spare resources of a fully placed-and-routed design such that its mapping is completely preserved. We also propose CAD optimizations which improve routability of the trigger circuitry, and minimize the impact on circuit delay. We find that using our techniques to implement the trigger logic can be an order of magnitude faster than a full recompilation.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927418","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927418","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927418.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927418/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Incremental distributed trigger insertion for efficient FPGA debug","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692911","htmlLink":"/document/6927418/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental distributed trigger insertion for efficient FPGA debug","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps304.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044829S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927418","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927419,"authors":[{"name":"Bajaj Ronak","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Bajaj","lastName":"Ronak","id":"38491253700"},{"name":"Suhaib A.

We can show that the proposed method results in circuits that run at around double the frequency of other methods, demonstrating that the structure of the DSP block must be considered when scheduling complex expressions.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927419","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927419","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927419.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient mapping of mathematical expressions into DSP blocks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927419/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Efficient mapping of mathematical expressions into DSP blocks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927419/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14692887","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient mapping of mathematical expressions into DSP blocks","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps305.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.060246S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927419","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927420,"authors":[{"name":"Siqi Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Siqi","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085487534"},{"name":"Nam Khanh Pham","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Nam Khanh","lastName":"Pham","id":"37076826300"},{"name":"Amit Kumar Singh","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Amit Kumar","lastName":"Singh","id":"37575964000"},{"name":"Akash Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore, Singapore"],"firstName":"Akash","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37292250700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927420","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":190},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Schedules","Power demand","Transistors","Power dissipation","Computer architecture","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","low-power electronics","scheduling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["leakage aware resource management","performance aware resource management","2D dynamically reconfigurable FPGA architectures","field programmable gate arrays","technological node shrinks","configuration pre-fetching","loads configurations","leakage power consumption","heuristic scheduler","cell allocation","antifragmentation purpose","leakage dissipation","schedule length"]}],"abstract":"The variety of applications for field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is continuously growing, thus it is important to address power consumption issues during the operation. As technological node shrinks, leakage power becomes increasingly critical in overall power consumption of FPGA. The technique of configuration pre-fetching (loads configurations as soon as possible) adopted to achieve high performance is one of the major reasons of leakage waste since regions containing reconfiguration information cannot be powered down in between the time gap of reconfiguration and execution. In this work, we present a heuristic approach to minimize the leakage power consumption for two-dimensional reconfigurable FPGA architectures. The heuristic scheduler is based on list scheduling and exploits dynamic priority for sorting the tasks into schedule order and a cost function for cell allocation. Farthest placement scheme is adopted for anti-fragmentation purpose. The cost function provides control to compromise between leakage dissipation and schedule length.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Leakage and performance aware resource management for 2D dynamically reconfigurable FPGA architectures","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927420","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927420.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927420/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Leakage and performance aware resource management for 2D dynamically reconfigurable FPGA architectures","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927420/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692829","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Leakage and performance aware resource management for 2D dynamically reconfigurable FPGA architectures","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps306.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.059537S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927420","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927422,"authors":[{"name":"Emna Amouri","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI (UMR 5141) Departement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM/TELECOM ParisTech., Paris, France"],"firstName":"Emna","lastName":"Amouri","id":"37400153800"},{"name":"Shivam Bhasin","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI (UMR 5141) Departement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM/TELECOM ParisTech., Paris, France"],"firstName":"Shivam","lastName":"Bhasin","id":"37392052300"},{"name":"Yves Mathieu","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI (UMR 5141) Departement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM/TELECOM ParisTech., Paris, France"],"firstName":"Yves","lastName":"Mathieu","id":"37543286500"},{"name":"Tarik Graba","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI (UMR 5141) Departement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM/TELECOM ParisTech., Paris, France"],"firstName":"Tarik","lastName":"Graba","id":"37399073200"},{"name":"Jean-Luc Danger","affiliation":["CNRS LTCI (UMR 5141) Departement COMELEC, Institut TELECOM/TELECOM ParisTech., Paris, France"],"firstName":"Jean-Luc","lastName":"Danger","id":"37085353327"},{"name":"Habib Mehrez","affiliation":["LIP6, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie 4, Paris, France"],"firstName":"Habib","lastName":"Mehrez","id":"37284092100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927422","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":375},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Field programmable gate arrays","Delays","Cryptography","Switches"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CAD","field programmable gate arrays","microprocessor chips","network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["WDDL dual-rail logic","physical security","multilevel structure","routing resources number","wave dynamic differential logic","custom tree-based FPGA","differential power attacks","DPA","computer-aided design","CAD tools","balancing-aware routing","crypto-processor"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["placement","routing","balance","Tree-based FPGA","Differential Power Analysis","WDDL","security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927422","abstract":"The Tree-based FPGA offers better density and timing determinism than traditional mesh-based FPGA. Moreover, thanks to its multilevel structure, it offers greater easiness to balance dual signals in terms of routing resources number. In this paper, we study the use of the Wave Dynamic Differential Logic (WDDL) on a custom tree-based FPGA of 2048 cells. The WDDL technique offers an effective way to withstand Differential Power Attacks (DPA). However, the effectiveness of this countermeasure is guaranteed provided a symmetry is maintained between the routing of both the direct and complementary paths, which is very hard to achieve in FPGA. Thus, balancing aware Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools must be developed. In this work, we propose first adjacent placement and balancing-aware routing techniques for tree-based FPGA to counter the routing unbalance. Then side channel analyses are performed on FPGA circuit implementing PRESENT crypto-processor. Experimental results show that the balancing methods enhance the design security against side channel attacks.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927422","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927422.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927422","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Balancing WDDL dual-rail logic in a tree-based FPGA to enhance physical security","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927422/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Balancing WDDL dual-rail logic in a tree-based FPGA to enhance physical security","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927422/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692848","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Balancing WDDL dual-rail logic in a tree-based FPGA to enhance physical security","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056408S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927422","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927426,"authors":[{"name":"Gorker Alp Malazgirt","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Bogazici University, Bebek, Istanbul"],"firstName":"Gorker Alp","lastName":"Malazgirt","id":"38243476000"},{"name":"Hasan Erdem Yantir","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Bogazici University, Bebek, Istanbul"],"firstName":"Hasan Erdem","lastName":"Yantir","id":"37076597700"},{"name":"Arda Yurdakul","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Bogazici University, Bebek, Istanbul"],"firstName":"Arda","lastName":"Yurdakul","id":"37298931200"},{"name":"Smail Niar","affiliation":["LAMIH University of Valenciennes, Valenciennes, France"],"firstName":"Smail","lastName":"Niar","id":"37298902900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927426","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":383},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927426","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parallel processing","Field programmable gate arrays","Random access memory","Program processors","Pattern matching","Registers","Ports (Computers)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","logic design","multiport networks","random-access storage","string matching","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application specific multi-port memory customization","FPGA","block RAMs","BRAMs","multi-port memory structures","LUT-based multiport memories","string matching algorithms"]}],"abstract":"FPGA block RAMs (BRAMs) offer speed advantages compared to LUT-based memory designs but a BRAM has only one read and one write port.

Dynamic Power-Gating (DPG), in which parts of the FPGA in-use logic blocks are powered-down at run-time, is a promising technique to reduce the static power. Adoption of such emerging DPG enabled FPGA architectures remains challenging as the current tool-chains to program the FPGA does not support this type of power-gating. Moreover, manually identifying profitable power-gating opportunities in an application requires significant design expertise and is time consuming. In this paper, we propose a high-level synthesis-based design framework that exploits the dynamic power-gating feature of the FPGAs to minimize the static power dissipation. We use this framework on a set of CHStone benchmark suite and demonstrate that power-gating opportunities for hardware accelerators can be identified in an automatic way. Results show that up to 96% reduction in static energy is achieved for individual accelerators using dynamic power-gating technique.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-level synthesis-based design methodology for Dynamic Power-Gated FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927433","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927433","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927433.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927433","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927433/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"High-level synthesis-based design methodology for Dynamic Power-Gated FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927433/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692843","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-level synthesis-based design methodology for Dynamic Power-Gated FPGAs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"ps403.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.108054S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927433","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927435,"authors":[{"name":"Keitaro Takizawa","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Japan"],"firstName":"Keitaro","lastName":"Takizawa","id":"37085532128"},{"name":"Shunya Hosaka","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Japan"],"firstName":"Shunya","lastName":"Hosaka","id":"37085538347"},{"name":"Hiroshi Saito","affiliation":["University of Aizu, Japan"],"firstName":"Hiroshi","lastName":"Saito","id":"37436674500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927435","dbTime":"22 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":222},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Registers","Asynchronous circuits","Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware design languages","Logic gates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","field programmable gate arrays","integrated circuit design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["asynchronous circuits","bundled-data implementation","design support tool set","commercial FPGA","latency constraint","constraint generation","timing verification","delay adjustment","energy consumption","power consumption"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose a design support tool set for asynchronous circuits with bundled-data implementation to implement them on commercial FPGAs easily considering a latency constraint.

FPGA based heterogeneous computing is an especially promising direction since it allows for the creation of custom hardware solutions for data centric parallel applications. One of the main issues delaying wide spread adoption of FPGAs as main stream high performance computing devices is the difficulty in programming them. OpenCL was meant to address the difficulties and the non-uniformity related to programming heterogeneous devices, unfortunately because of its complexity it sets the bar high for many software programmers, preventing them from directly benefiting from the computing power and energy efficiency that OpenCL and heterogeneous computing have to offer. This work presents an effort to bridge the gap by extending an existing Java programming framework (APARAPI), based on OpenCL, so that it can be used to program FPGAs at a high level of abstraction and increased ease of programmability. We run several real world algorithms to assess the performance of the APARAPI framework on both a low end and a high end system.

Our approach does not start with specialized courses in master or diploma programs, but already with the motivation of primary school children for technical disciplines. Girls and boys are addressed equally. In school, children are made familiar with programmable circuits and thus motivated to study computer science with a specialization in computer engineering.

Experiments conducted show that the proposed schemes have an excellent error correction percentage (over 99%), especially for multi-bit upsets, while using up to 59.37% lesser area overhead compared with other state-of-the-art.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927448/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692824","htmlLink":"/document/6927448/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Multi-directional error correction schemes for SRAM-based FPGAs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-directional error correction schemes for SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"t1a03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087624S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927448","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927449,"authors":[{"name":"Teng Xu","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Teng","lastName":"Xu","id":"37076588500"},{"name":"Miodrag Potkonjak","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, University of California, Los Angeles"],"firstName":"Miodrag","lastName":"Potkonjak","id":"37279233100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927449","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":37,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":652},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Table lookup","Security","Field programmable gate arrays","Thermal stability","Temperature distribution","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","flexible electronics","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["flexible FPGA-based digital PUF","robust FPGA-based digital PUF","physical unclonable function","analog delay PUF","look-up tables","LUTs","security primitive","NIST randomness tests","security attacks"]}],"abstract":"We have developed the first FPGA-based digital physical unclonable function (PUF) by leveraging the reconfigurability of an FPGA and introducing a new way of using the standard analog delay PUF.

While modern High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools provide better programming models, the interface they offer is still too low-level. In order to produce good quality hardware designs with these tools, the users are forced to manually perform optimizations that demand detailed knowledge of both the application and the implementation platform. Additionally, many HLS tools only generate isolated hardware modules that the user still needs to integrate into a system design before generating the FPGA bitstream. These problems make HLS tools difficult to use for application developers who have little hardware design knowledge. To address these problems, we propose an automated methodology to generate FPGA bitstreams from high-level programs written in Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). We leverage the domain-knowledge conveyed by the DSL and its domain-specific semantics to extract application parallelism, perform optimizations and also identify a suitable system-architecture for the implementation, thereby, relieving the user from most of the hardware-level details. We demonstrate the high productivity and high design quality this approach offers by automatically generating hardware systems from applications written in OptiML, a machine-learning DSL. To evaluate our methodology, we use four OptiML applications and show that we can easily generate different solutions which achieve different trade-offs between performance and area. More importantly, the results reveal that our generated hardware achieves much better performance compared to the one obtained from using the HLS tool without platform-specific optimizations.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927454","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927454.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927454","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware system synthesis from Domain-Specific Languages","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Hardware system synthesis from Domain-Specific Languages","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14692944","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927454/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927454/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware system synthesis from Domain-Specific Languages","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"t1c01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.076988S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927454","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927455,"authors":[{"name":"Roland Dobai","affiliation":["Faculty of Information Technology, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic"],"firstName":"Roland","lastName":"Dobai","id":"37681916400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927455","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Evolutionary on-line synthesis of hardware accelerators for software modules in reconfigurable embedded systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927455","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Hardware","Random access memory","Embedded systems","Noise","Training data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","evolutionary computation","hardware description languages","high level synthesis","programmable logic devices"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["evolutionary on-line synthesis","hardware accelerators","software modules","reconfigurable embedded systems","high-level synthesis","programming language","hardware description language","evolutionary design","programmable logic","software-based implementation","image filter design","specific application domains"]}],"abstract":"High-level synthesis ensures that a program code written in a programming language can be easily transferred into a hardware description language and thereby makes the design process faster and less demanding. However, professional synthesis tools are very complex and not well suited for deployment in embedded systems with limited resources. Evolutionary on-line synthesis is proposed in this paper which represents a new way to exploit evolutionary design. The program code is deployed into the processor of a reconfigurable embedded platform and the evolutionary design framework into its programmable logic. The functionality is transferred from software into hardware on-line, during runtime. The proposed approach serves essentially the same purpose as high-level synthesis but the synthesis can be performed by a simple embedded computational platform and on-line. The approach can offer higher flexibility in contrast with similar conventional approaches because it can develop solutions for unexpected situations. The proposed approach has the advantage over previous evolutionary design systems because no separated training phase is required and the software-based (correct) implementation is always available which can be exploited for monitoring and re-evolving the solution if this is necessary. The proposed evolutionary on-line synthesis was evaluated on the problem of image filter design. The achieved results indicate that the automated on-line synthesis based on evolution is possible and it can provide even better results than conventional implementations in specific application domains.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927455","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927455.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927455/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Evolutionary on-line synthesis of hardware accelerators for software modules in reconfigurable embedded systems","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692847","htmlLink":"/document/6927455/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Evolutionary on-line synthesis of hardware accelerators for software modules in reconfigurable embedded systems","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"t1c02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061559S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927455","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927456,"authors":[{"name":"Davor Capalija","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"firstName":"Davor","lastName":"Capalija","id":"37681205700"},{"name":"Tarek S.

This paper presents a CAD flow for high-level dynamic power estimation on FPGAs. The method is based on the monitoring of toggling activity for relevant signals by introducing event counters. The appropriate signals are selected using the Greedy Stepwise filter. Our approach is based on a generic method that is able to produce a power model for any block-based circuit.

Among various interconnection methods, a PCIe bus is an attractive choice for loosely coupled accelerators. Because there is no standard host-FPGA communication library, FPGA developers have to write significant amounts of PCIe related code at both the FPGA side and the host processor side. A high-performance host-FPGA PCIe communication library holds the key to broadening the use of FPGA accelerators. In this paper we target efficiency and flexibility as two important features in such a library. We discuss the challenges in providing these features, and present our solution to these challenges. We propose EPEE, an efficient and flexible host-FPGA PCIe communication library and describe its design. We implemented EPEE in various generations of Xilinx FPGAs with up to 26.24 Gbps half-duplex and 43.02 Gbps full-duplex aggregate throughput in the PCIe Gen2 X8 mode; these are at the best utilization levels that a host-FPGA PCIe library can achieve. The EPEE library has been integrated into four different FPGA applications with different data usage patterns in various institutes.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient and flexible host-FPGA PCIe communication library","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927459","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927459","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927459.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927459","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An efficient and flexible host-FPGA PCIe communication library","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927459/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692933","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient and flexible host-FPGA PCIe communication library","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"t2a02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070093S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927459","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927461,"authors":[{"name":"Liqun Yang","affiliation":["System on Programmable Chip Research Department, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"lastName":"Liqun Yang","id":"37085507431"},{"name":"Haigang Yang","affiliation":["System on Programmable Chip Research Department, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"lastName":"Haigang Yang","id":"37085502601"},{"name":"Wei Li","affiliation":["System on Programmable Chip Research Department, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"lastName":"Wei Li","id":"37085517122"},{"name":"Zhihua Li","affiliation":["System on Programmable Chip Research Department, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"lastName":"Zhihua Li","id":"37085495804"},{"name":"Zhihong Huang","affiliation":["System on Programmable Chip Research Department, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Zhihong","lastName":"Huang","id":"37085509084"},{"name":"Colin Yu Lin","affiliation":["System on Programmable Chip Research Department, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"lastName":"Colin Yu Lin","id":"37085349767"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927461","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":180},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Delays","Video recording"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","hardware description languages","nanotechnology"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA architectures","semisupervised modeling approach","performance characterization","semisupervised model tree algorithm","tool flow","verilog-to-routing","VTR","certain metric","commercial nanotechnology","architecture design space exploration","size 40 nm"]}],"abstract":"An approach to estimate the performance of FPGA architectures is proposed based on semi-supervised model tree algorithm.

This structure is generated and optimized automatically based on a user-defined filter configuration. For complex, higher-level algorithms, an optimized array of independent, software-based processing units is generated. As an example application, we chose object recognition based on the well-known SURF algorithm (\u201cSpeeded Up Robust Features\u201d), which performs natural feature detection and description.

The resulting reconfigurable pipelined single and multiple constant multipliers can be used for time-multiplexed multiplication reducing the required FPGA logic resources.

We can show that the achieved pipelined run-time reconfigurable constant multipliers on average only need about 77% of the slices compared to the best solutions based on the merging of adder graphs published so far.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927466","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927466.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927466","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined reconfigurable multiplication with constants on FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927466/","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined reconfigurable multiplication with constants on FPGAs","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927466/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692821","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined reconfigurable multiplication with constants on FPGAs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"t2c01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.077629S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927466","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6927467,"authors":[{"name":"Soh Jun Jie","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"],"lastName":"Soh Jun Jie","id":"37085408549"},{"name":"Nachiket Kapre","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University"],"firstName":"Nachiket","lastName":"Kapre","id":"37265546500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927467","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":384},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparing soft and hard vector processing in FPGA-based embedded systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927467","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Kernel","Radio frequency","System-on-chip","Measurement","Throughput","Tuning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","field programmable gate arrays","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FPGA-based embedded systems","soft vector processing","hard vector processing","embedded hard vector processors","FPGA-based SoC","Xilinx Zynq","auto-tuning runtime","data-parallel computation","scalar ARM processor","embedded NEON engine","Vectorblox MXP","computational conditions","scalar cores","hard vector blocks","data-parallel benchmarks","MXP soft vector processor","auto-generated data-parallel code"]}],"abstract":"Soft vector processors can augment and extend the capability of embedded hard vector processors in FPGA-based SoCs such as the Xilinx Zynq.

However, mapping the commonly used carry save adders (CSA) of classical compressor trees to FPGAs suffers from a poor resource utilization. This can be enhanced by using generalized performance counters (GPCs). Prior work has shown that high efficient GPCs can be constructed by exploiting the low-level structure of the FPGA. However, due to their irregular shape, the selection of those is not straight forward. Furthermore, the compressor tree has to be pipelined to achieve the potential FPGA performance. Then, a selection between registered GPCs or flip-flops has to be done to balance the pipeline. This work defines the pipelined compressor tree synthesis as an optimization problem and proposes a (resource) optimal method using integer linear programming (ILP). Besides that, two new GPC mappings with high efficiency are proposed for Xilinx FPGAs.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927468.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927468","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927468","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927468","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipelined compressor tree optimization using integer linear programming","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Field programmable gate arrays","Radiation detectors","Delays","Pipeline processing","Table lookup","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","carry logic","field programmable gate arrays","flip-flops","integer programming","linear programming","pipeline processing","resource allocation","trees (mathematics)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pipelined compressor tree optimization","integer linear programming","arithmetic operations","carry save adders","CSA","resource utilization","generalized performance counters","low-level structure","FPGA performance","registered GPC","flip-flops","pipelined compressor tree synthesis","optimization problem","resource optimal method","ILP","GPC mappings","Xilinx FPGA"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927468/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Pipelined compressor tree optimization using integer linear programming","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927468/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692912","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipelined compressor tree optimization using integer linear programming","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"t2c03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075151S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927468","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927470,"authors":[{"name":"Zhenghong Jiang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Zhenghong Jiang","id":"37085547764"},{"name":"Colin Yu Lin","affiliation":["System on Programmable Chip Research Department, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Colin Yu Lin","id":"37085349767"},{"name":"Liqun Yang","affiliation":["University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Liqun Yang","id":"37085507431"},{"name":"Fei Wang","affiliation":["System on Programmable Chip Research Department, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Fei Wang","id":"38551693200"},{"name":"Haigang Yang","affiliation":["System on Programmable Chip Research Department, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Haigang Yang","id":"37291236200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927470","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":250},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Table lookup","Field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","table lookup"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["architecture parameters","dual-output lookup tables","dual-output LUT","FPGA","architectural parameters","area efficiency","cluster inputs","area-delay product"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927470","abstract":"Dual-output lookup tables (LUTs) are mainstream in the design of commercial FPGA products.

In this paper, we focus on the effect of ratio of shared inputs on the performance and area-efficiency. First, we study the required cluster inputs and derive a relationship between cluster inputs, LUT size and cluster size under different ratios of shared inputs. Secondly, our evaluation results show that a FPGA with 4-LUTs and a shared input ratio of two thirds is preferred for area-efficiency, while a large LUT size of 9 with no shared inputs achieves best performance. Finally, we determine that a LUT size of 4, a cluster size from 3 to 8, and a shared input ratio between 1/3 and 2/3, provide the best area-delay product for dual-output LUT based FPGAs.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927470","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927470.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927470","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploring architecture parameters for dual-output LUT based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927470/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Exploring architecture parameters for dual-output LUT based FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927470/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692889","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploring architecture parameters for dual-output LUT based FPGAs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"th1c01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072146S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927470","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927471,"authors":[{"name":"Ghada Dessouky","affiliation":["Institute for Parallel and Distributed Systems, University of Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Ghada","lastName":"Dessouky","id":"37085455928"},{"name":"Michael J.

This facilitates the dynamic sharing of valuable and scarce on-chip memory among several processing elements (PEs), according to their dynamic run-time memory requirements. Different real-time applications are becoming increasingly dynamic which leads to unexpected and variable memory footprints, and static allocation of the worst-case memory requirements would result in costly overheads and inefficient memory utilization. The proposed scalable BRAM memory management architecture adaptively manages these dynamic memory requirements and balances the buffer memory over several PEs to reduce the total memory required, compared to the worst-case memory footprint for all PEs. The run-time adaptive system allocates BRAM to each PE sufficiently fast enough as required and utilized. In a case study, a significant improvement in BRAM utilization with limited overhead has been achieved due to the adaptive memory management architecture. The proposed system supports different BRAM types and configurations, and automated dynamic allocation and deallocation of BRAM resources, and is therefore well suited for the dynamic memory footprints of FPGA-based reconfigurable architectures.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927471","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927471.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927471","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive Dynamic On-chip Memory Management for FPGA-based reconfigurable architectures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927471","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927471/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive Dynamic On-chip Memory Management for FPGA-based reconfigurable architectures","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692895","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927471/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive Dynamic On-chip Memory Management for FPGA-based reconfigurable architectures","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"th1c02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062509S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927471","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927472,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Moreover, the modular design of the architecture simplifies customization or extension to special control problem classes. The proposed FPGA solution can broaden the applicability of solving complex or large MPC problems in embedded computing platforms that were so far considered out of reach.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA implementation of an interior point method for high-speed model predictive control","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927473","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927473.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927473","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"FPGA implementation of an interior point method for high-speed model predictive control","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927473/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692927","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA implementation of an interior point method for high-speed model predictive control","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"th2a01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069093S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927474,"authors":[{"name":"Oana Boncalo","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Oana","lastName":"Boncalo","id":"37396354200"},{"name":"Alexandru Amaricai","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Alexandru","lastName":"Amaricai","id":"37396351700"},{"name":"Andrei Hera","affiliation":["Computer Engineering Department, University Politehnica Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania"],"firstName":"Andrei","lastName":"Hera","id":"37085361239"},{"name":"Valentin Savin","affiliation":["CEA-LETI, MINATEC Campus, Grenoble, France val entin"],"firstName":"Valentin","lastName":"Savin","id":"37605871100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927474","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":420},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Parity check codes","Decoding","Field programmable gate arrays","Throughput","Read only memory","Computer architecture","Quantization (signal)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["block codes","decoding","field programmable gate arrays","parity check codes","WiMax"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cost-efficient FPGA layered LDPC decoder","serial AP-LLR processing","quasicyclic irregular LDPC decoder","variable-check node unit","layer message computation","expansion factor","check-node message compression","BRAM block utilization","WiMAX QC irregular LDPC code","field programmable gate arrays","low-density parity-check codes","serial a posteriori logarithmic likelihood ratio processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LDPC","Min-Sum","Layered scheduling","FPGA"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927474","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927474.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927474","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927474","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cost-efficient FPGA layered LDPC decoder with serial AP-LLR processing","abstract":"This paper proposes an FPGA based layered architecture for quasi-cyclic (QC) irregular LDPC decoder. Our approach is based on merging variable and check node processing into one single variable-check node (VCN) unit. Layer message computation is done using a parallel scheme of a number of VCNs equal to the expansion factor of the QC matrix. The proposed architecture is characterized by the serial processing of the a posteriori LLRs by an FPGA specific high frequency VCN unit implementation using ROM memories. In our approach data conversions as well as additions and comparators are replaced by look-up-tables implemented using distributed RAM. In addition to this, other techniques such as: efficient packaging of LLRs messages and check-node message compression as well as the configurable port width of the FPGA's BRAM are used to reduce BRAM block utilization. Throughput increase is achieved by utilizing techniques such as pipelining, parallel processing of multiple VCNs, as well as relatively high working frequency. Implementation results for the WiMAX (1152, 2304) QC irregular LDPC code indicate that the proposed architecture has up to 3x less slices resource utilization and up to 1 order of magnitude less BRAM blocks with respect to other approaches, while maintaining a throughput of several hundreds of Mbps (800 Mbps coded bits). We achieved this without sacrificing flexibility; therefore we can easily adapt our design to accommodate different code rates.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927474/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14692923","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927474/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Cost-efficient FPGA layered LDPC decoder with serial AP-LLR processing","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cost-efficient FPGA layered LDPC decoder with serial AP-LLR processing","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"th2a02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102211S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927474","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927476,"authors":[{"name":"Rui Santos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Rui","lastName":"Santos","id":"37085406585"},{"name":"Shyamsundar Venkataraman","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Shyamsundar","lastName":"Venkataraman","id":"37078321900"},{"name":"Anup Das","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Anup","lastName":"Das","id":"37070982100"},{"name":"Akash Kumar","affiliation":["Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, National University of Singapore"],"firstName":"Akash","lastName":"Kumar","id":"37292250700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927476","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":14,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":252},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927476","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Hardware","Schedules","Equations","Fault tolerance","Fault tolerant systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","field programmable gate arrays","scheduling","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["system reliability","earliest deadline as late as possible algorithm","EDL algorithm","scrubbing schedule","critical tasks","fault-tolerance requirements","scrubbing process","scrubbing techniques","SRAM-based field programmable gate arrays","static-RAM-based FPGA"]}],"abstract":"Scrubbing has been considered as an effective mechanism to provide fault-tolerance in Static-RAM (SRAM)-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). However, the current scrubbing techniques execute without considering the criticality and timing of the user tasks implemented in the FPGA. They often do not execute the scrubbing process in the right instant, which minimizes the probability of each task being executed without transient faults. Moreover, these current solutions are not adapted to the tasks' fault-tolerance requirements, since they may not properly protect the most critical tasks in the system. However, if they do it, they waste resources with the less critical tasks. In this paper, a new scrubbing mechanism is proposed. This new approach adapts the scrubbing mechanism to the tasks' execution, by a proper scheduling and according to their criticality. A proposed heuristic finds a feasible scrubbing schedule for each hardware task. Firstly, the minimum scrubbing periods are computed according to the criticality of each implemented hardware task. Secondly, a proper scrubbing schedule following the EDL (Earliest Deadline as Late as possible) algorithm is found, maximizing the reliability of the system. The experimental results show up to 79% improvements on the system reliability, achieved without wasting scrubbing resources.","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927476.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927476","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927476","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Criticality-aware scrubbing mechanism for SRAM-based FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Criticality-aware scrubbing mechanism for SRAM-based FPGAs","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927476/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927476/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692881","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Criticality-aware scrubbing mechanism for SRAM-based FPGAs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"th2b01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110168S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927476","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927478,"authors":[{"name":"Ernesto Sanchez","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Ernesto","lastName":"Sanchez","id":"37277847800"},{"name":"Luca Sterpone","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Sterpone","id":"37085491857"},{"name":"Anees Ullah","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Automatica e Informatica, Politecnico di Torino, Torino, Italy"],"firstName":"Anees","lastName":"Ullah","id":"37679250000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927478","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":217},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective emulation of permanent faults in ASICs through dynamically reconfigurable FPGAs","abstract":"Hardware fault emulation for Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) on FPGAs can considerably reduce the time required for the fault simulation.

Researchers are trying to find new ways to improve compilation time without degrading design performance. In this paper, we present a novel approach that identifies tightly grouped FPGA logic blocks and then uses this information during circuit placement. Our approach is an orthogonal optimization applicable in incremental design and physical optimization, and reduces placement run-time. Specifically, we present a new algorithm that analyzes designs post-placement to extract medium-grained super-clusters that consist of two to seventeen clusters, which we call \u201cgems\u201d. We modified VPR's simulated annealing placement algorithm to place our mixture of gems and clusters. Our new \u201cSingularity Annealing\u201d algorithm first crushes each cluster grouping into a \u201csingularity\u201d (treated as a single cluster). Then, the Singularity Annealer is run over this condensed circuit to obtain an initial placement, followed by an expansion of the singularities. Finally, we run a second low-temperature annealing phase on the entire expanded circuit. Our results show that our system reduces placement run-time on average by 17% while maintains the designs critical path delay, and increases designs channel width, and wirelength by 2% and 6.3%, respectively. We have also presented a test case to show the re-usability of gems in an incremental design example.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927479/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692907","htmlLink":"/document/6927479/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Identifying and placing heterogeneously-sized cluster groupings based on FPGA placement data","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Identifying and placing heterogeneously-sized cluster groupings based on FPGA placement data","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"th2c01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06257S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927479","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927480,"authors":[{"name":"Christian Beckhoff","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Beckhoff","id":"37695019800"},{"name":"Dirk Koch","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Koch","id":"38268904500"},{"name":"Jim Torresen","affiliation":["University of Oslo, Norway"],"firstName":"Jim","lastName":"Torresen","id":"37282129200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927480","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":344},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Clocks","Digital signal processing","Routing","Compression algorithms","Hardware","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data compression","field programmable gate arrays","file organisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["portable module relocation","bitstream compression","Xilinx FPGAs","configuration bitstream generation","configuration bitstream compression","design phase","partial bitstream decomposition","module independent configuration data","module dependent configuration data","DMA configuration controller","atomic operation","module relocation","fast partial reconfiguration","logic cost","direct memory accesses"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927480","abstract":"This paper presents a novel methodology for generating and compressing configuration bitstreams for modules that can be executed at different positions of an FPGA.

General-Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) and recent many-core CPUs have also taken advantage of the recent technological innovations in integrated circuit (IC) design and had also dramatically improved their peak performances. In this paper, we compare the trends of these computing architectures for high-performance computing and survey these platforms in the execution of algorithms belonging to different scientific application domains. Trends in peak performance, power consumption and sustained performances, for particular applications, show that FPGAs are increasing the gap to GPUs and many-core CPUs moving them away from high-performance computing with intensive floating-point calculations. FPGAs become competitive for custom floating-point or fixed-point representations, for smaller input sizes of certain algorithms, for combinational logic problems and parallel map-reduce

Nevertheless, picking the most suitable HLS for a certain class of algorithms depends on requirements such as area and throughput, as well as on programmer experience. In this paper, we explore the different trade-offs present when using a representative set of HLS tools in the context of Database Management Systems (DBMS) acceleration. More specifically, we conduct an empirical analysis of four representative frameworks (Bluespec SystemVerilog, Altera OpenCL, LegUp and Chisel) that we utilize to accelerate commonly-used database algorithms such as sorting, the median operator, and hash joins. Through our implementation experience and empirical results for database acceleration, we conclude that the selection of the most suitable HLS depends on a set of orthogonal characteristics, which we highlight for each HLS framework.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927484","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927484.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An empirical evaluation of High-Level Synthesis languages and tools for database acceleration","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An empirical evaluation of High-Level Synthesis languages and tools for database acceleration","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927484/","accessionNumber":"14692846","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An empirical evaluation of High-Level Synthesis languages and tools for database acceleration","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w1a03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097347S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927484","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927486,"authors":[{"name":"Honlian Su","affiliation":["Dept. of ICS, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Honlian","lastName":"Su","id":"37085498595"},{"name":"Yu Fujita","affiliation":["Dept. of ICS, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Fujita","id":"37085375508"},{"name":"Hideharu Amano","affiliation":["Dept. of ICS, Keio University, Yokohama, Japan"],"firstName":"Hideharu","lastName":"Amano","id":"37085399034"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927486","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Arrays","Microcontrollers","Registers","Voltage control","Delays","Leakage currents","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS logic circuits","elemental semiconductors","field programmable gate arrays","leakage currents","low-power electronics","microcontrollers","silicon","silicon-on-insulator"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["body bias control","coarse grained reconfigurable accelerator","high performance processing","battery driven devices","cool mega array","CMA-SOTB","silicon on thin box technology","clock frequency","forward bias voltage","reverse bias","leakage current","PE array","microcontroller","power consumption","filter application programs","energy efficiency","power supply voltage","size 65 nm","voltage 0.4 V","power 1.7 mW","frequency 89 MHz","Si"]}],"abstract":"For low power yet high performance processing in battery driven devices, a coarse grained reconfigurable accelerator called Cool Mega Array (CMA)-SOTB is implemented by using Silicon on Thin BOX (SOTB), a new process technology developed by the Low-power Electronics Association & Project (LEAP). A real chip using a 65nm experimental process achieved a sustained performance of 192MOPS with a power supply of 0.4V and power consumption of 1.7mW. A clock frequency of 89MHz was achieved with a power supply of just 0.4V when a forward bias voltage was given. When using a reverse bias, the leakage current could be suppressed to less than 20\u03bcW in the stand-by mode. The key concept of CMA-SOTB is maintaining a balance between performance and leakage current by independently controlling the bias voltages of the PE array and the microcontroller. Evaluations of the operational frequency and power consumption of filter application programs shed light on how to find the combination of bias voltages that achieves the best energy efficiency for a required performance. The range of advantageous power supply voltage for a required performance considering the body bias was also found.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927486","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927486.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Body bias control for a coarse grained reconfigurable accelerator implemented with Silicon on Thin BOX technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927486","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Body bias control for a coarse grained reconfigurable accelerator implemented with Silicon on Thin BOX technology","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927486/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692935","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927486/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Body bias control for a coarse grained reconfigurable accelerator implemented with Silicon on Thin BOX technology","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w1b02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.041605S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927486","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-09-09"},{"_id":6927487,"authors":[{"name":"Eric S.

In order to achieve higher performance, memcached has been evaluated on various platforms. Among them, FPGA seems to be the most efficient platform to run memcached, and several research groups are trying to achieve higher throughput with it. However, it is difficult to utilize a large amount of memory (several dozen gigabytes) with an FPGA. Some groups are trying to solve this problem by using an embedded CPU for memory allocation and another group is employing an SSD. Unlike other approaches that try to replace memcached itself on FPGAs, our approach augments the software memcached running on the host CPU by caching its data and some operations at the FPGA-equipped network interface card (NIC) mounted on the server. The locality of memcached data enables the FPGA NIC to have a fairly high hit rate with a smaller memory. We first explore the cache parameters by software simulations and estimate the effectiveness of our approach, and then prototype a system to prove its effectiveness. Through our evaluation with YCSB, a standard key-value store (KVS) benchmarking tool, we estimate that the latency improved by an order of magnitude over software memcached running on a high performance CPU.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927487","startPage":"1","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927487.pdf","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927487","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927487/","displayDocTitle":"Caching memcached at reconfigurable network interface","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927487/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14692867","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Caching memcached at reconfigurable network interface","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w1b03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.093577S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927487","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927488,"authors":[{"name":"Kermin Fleming","affiliation":["VSSAD Group, Intel Corporation"],"firstName":"Kermin","lastName":"Fleming","id":"37686121200"},{"name":"Hsin-Jung Yang","affiliation":["Computer Science and A.I.

In spite of these advantages, FPGAs have been deployed in only a few, niche domains.We argue that the difficulty of programming FPGAs all but precludes their use in more general systems: FPGA programmers are currently exposed to all the gory system details that software operating systems long ago abstracted away. In this work, we present the Latency-insensitive Environment for Application Programming (LEAP), an FPGA operating system built around latency-insensitive communications channels. LEAP alleviates the FPGA programming problem by providing a rich set of portable latency-insensitive abstraction layers for program development. Unlike software operating systems services, which are generally dynamic, the nature of FPGAs requires that many configuration decisions be made at compile time. We present an extensible interface for compile-time management of resources. We demonstrate that LEAP provides design portability, while consuming as little as 3% of FPGA area, by mapping several designs on to various FPGA platforms.","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927488.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The LEAP FPGA operating system","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927488","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927488","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927488","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927488/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"The LEAP FPGA operating system","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692842","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927488/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The LEAP FPGA operating system","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w1c01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051922S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927488","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927491,"authors":[{"name":"Dirk Koch","affiliation":["The University of Manchester"],"firstName":"Dirk","lastName":"Koch","id":"38268904500"},{"name":"Christian Beckhoff","affiliation":["University of Oslo"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Beckhoff","id":"37695019800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927491","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":304},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Field programmable gate arrays","Wires","Libraries","Timing","Memory management","Clocks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","large-scale systems","modules","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hierarchically reconfigurable custom instruction set","reconfigurable softcore CPU","additive behavior","multiplicative behavior","bitstream storage requirement","complex system","reconfigurable submodule","field programmable gate array","partial reconfiguration","FPGA","hierarchical reconfiguration"]}],"abstract":"Partial reconfiguration allows some applications to substantially save FPGA area by time sharing resources among multiple modules. In this paper, we push this approach further by introducing hierarchical reconfiguration where reconfigurable modules can have reconfigurable submodules. This is useful for complex systems where many modules have common parts or where modules can share components. For such systems, we show that the number of bitstreams and the bitstream storage requirements can be scaled down from a multiplicative to an additive behavior with respect to the number of modules and submodules. A case study consisting of different reconfigurable softcore CPUs and hierarchically reconfigurable custom instruction set extensions demonstrates a 18.7\u00d7 lower bitstream storage requirement and up to 10\u00d7 faster reconfiguration speed when using hierarchical reconfiguration instead of using conventional single-level module-based reconfiguration.","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927491.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hierarchical reconfiguration of FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927491","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927491","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927491","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927491/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Hierarchical reconfiguration of FPGAs","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692850","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927491/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hierarchical reconfiguration of FPGAs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w2a01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049494S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927491","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927492,"authors":[{"name":"Tuan D.

However, with the insatiable demands of supporting an extensive range of applications beyond the limited resources of FPGA chip and shorter time-to-market, many research works on partially reconfigurable (PR) FPGA architectures have been conducted to fulfill the needs. Those have yet to fully provide a versatile framework to exploit the flexibility of PR such as hardware/software task migration and bitstream relocation; more importantly, the on-chip debug features to access all processors currently loaded in the system are compromised because of the lack of native-support from vendor tools. In this paper, a novel PR-HMPSoC architecture for dynamic FPGA-based embedded system is proposed to provide solutions for all of the above issues. The results from the experimental system consisting of one static Microblaze and three PR Microblaze/hardware accelerators connected by a Network-on-Chip show that the architecture is very promising with just 8% reduction in operating frequency.","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927492.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927492","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927492","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"PR-HMPSoC: A versatile partially reconfigurable heterogeneous Multiprocessor System-on-Chip for dynamic FPGA-based embedded systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"PR-HMPSoC: A versatile partially reconfigurable heterogeneous Multiprocessor System-on-Chip for dynamic FPGA-based embedded systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927492/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927492/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692838","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PR-HMPSoC: A versatile partially reconfigurable heterogeneous Multiprocessor System-on-Chip for dynamic FPGA-based embedded systems","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w2a02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069559S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927492","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927493,"authors":[{"name":"Marcin Rogawski","affiliation":["George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, US"],"firstName":"Marcin","lastName":"Rogawski"},{"name":"Ekawat Homsirikamol","affiliation":["George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, US"],"firstName":"Ekawat","lastName":"Homsirikamol"},{"name":"Kris Gaj","affiliation":["George Mason University, Fairfax, VA, US"],"firstName":"Kris","lastName":"Gaj"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927493","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":214},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel modular adder for one thousand bits and more using fast carry chains of modern FPGAs","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927493.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927493","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Adders","Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","Global Positioning System","Delays","Optimization"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adders","carry logic","field programmable gate arrays","logic design","public key cryptography"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modular adder","fast carry chains","field programmable gate arrays","FPGA","low-latency family","high-radix parallel prefix network adders","public key cryptography schemes"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","parallel prefix network","Kogge-Stone","Brent-Kung","ripple carry adder"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927493","abstract":"In this paper a novel, low-latency family of high-radix Parallel Prefix Network adders and modular adders has been proposed.

For these systems, it is desirable to create a series of partial bitstreams which represent tasks which can be located in multiple regions in the FPGA fabric. While the transferal of homogeneous collections of lookup-table based logic blocks from region to region has been shown to be relatively straightforward, it is more difficult to transfer partial bitstreams which contain fixed-function resources, such as block RAMs and DSP blocks. In this paper we consider FPGA architecture enhancements which allow for the migration of partial bitstreams including fixed-function resources from region to region even if these resources are not located in the same position in each region. Our approach does not require significant, time-consuming place-and-route during the migration process. We quantify the cost of inserting additional routing resources into the FPGA architecture to allow for easy migration of heterogeneous, fixed-function resources. Our experiments show that this flexibility can be added for a relatively low overhead and performance penalty.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927494","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927494.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927494","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA architecture support for heterogeneous, relocatable partial bitstreams","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"FPGA architecture support for heterogeneous, relocatable partial bitstreams","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927494/","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14692899","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927494/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA architecture support for heterogeneous, relocatable partial bitstreams","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w2a04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.180379S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927494","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6927495,"authors":[{"name":"Joshua S.

To ensure transparency - that such modifications do not affect the design's maximum clock frequency - we insert any additional logic post place-and-route, using only the spare resources that were not consumed by the pre-existing circuit. The typical challenge with adding new functionality into existing circuits incrementally is that spare FPGA resources to host this functionality must be located close to the input signals that it requires, in order to minimise the impact of routing delays. In congested designs, however, such co-location is often not possible. We overcome this challenge by using flow techniques to pipeline and route signals from where they originate, potentially in a region of high resource congestion, into a region of low congestion capable of hosting new circuitry, at the expense of latency. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach by augmenting realistic designs with self-monitoring circuitry, which is not sensitive to latency. We report results on circuits operating over 200MHz and show that our insertions have no impact on timing, are 2-4 times faster than compile-time insertion, and incur only a small power overhead.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transparent insertion of latency-oblivious logic onto FPGAs","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927497","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927497","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927497.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927497","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927497/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Transparent insertion of latency-oblivious logic onto FPGAs","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927497/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692913","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transparent insertion of latency-oblivious logic onto FPGAs","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w2b03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.128079S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927497","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927498,"authors":[{"name":"Jeffrey Goeders","affiliation":["The University of British Columbia Faculty of Medicine, Vancouver, BC, CA"],"firstName":"Jeffrey","lastName":"Goeders"},{"name":"Steven J.E.

The alternative is to debug using the RTL, which is beyond the expertise of software designers, and impractical for hardware designers as the RTL may not resemble the original source code.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927498","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927498.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927498","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective FPGA debug for high-level synthesis generated circuits","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927498/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Effective FPGA debug for high-level synthesis generated circuits","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927498/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692875","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effective FPGA debug for high-level synthesis generated circuits","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w2b04.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070617S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927498","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927499,"authors":[{"name":"Pingfan Meng","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, US"],"firstName":"Pingfan","lastName":"Meng"},{"name":"Matthew Jacobsen","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, US"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Jacobsen"},{"name":"Motoki Kimura","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, US"],"firstName":"Motoki","lastName":"Kimura"},{"name":"Vladimir Dergachev","affiliation":["BioNano Genomics, 9640 Towne Centre Dr. #100, San Diego, CA 92121, USA"],"firstName":"Vladimir","lastName":"Dergachev"},{"name":"Thomas Anantharaman","affiliation":["BioNano Genomics, 9640 Towne Centre Dr. #100, San Diego, CA 92121, USA"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Anantharaman"},{"name":"Michael Requa","affiliation":["BioNano Genomics, 9640 Towne Centre Dr. #100, San Diego, CA 92121, USA"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Requa"},{"name":"Ryan Kastner","affiliation":["University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, US"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kastner"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927499","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":195},"abstract":"De novo assembly is a widely used methodology in bioinformatics. However, the conventional short-read based de novo assembly is incapable of reliably reconstructing the large-scale structures of human genomes. Recently, a novel optical label based technology has enabled reliable large-scale de novo assembly. Despite its advantage in large-scale genome analysis, this new technology requires a more computationally intensive alignment algorithm than its conventional counterpart. For example, the run-time of reconstructing a human genome is on the order of 10; 000 hours on a sequential CPU. Therefore, in order to practically apply this new technology in genome research, accelerated approaches are desirable. In this paper, we present three different accelerated approaches, multi-core CPU, GPU and FPGA. Against the sequential software baseline, our multi-core CPU design achieved a 8.4\u00d7 speedup while the GPU and FPGA designs achieved 13.6\u00d7 and 115\u00d7 speedups respectively. We also reveal the insights of the design space exploration of this new assembly algorithm on these three different devices by comparing the results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927499.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"8","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927499","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927499","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927499","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hardware accelerated novel optical de novo assembly for large-scale genomes","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Graphics processing units","Assembly","Acceleration","Genomics","Instruction sets","Field programmable gate arrays","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bioinformatics","field programmable gate arrays","genomics","graphics processing units","multiprocessing systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hardware accelerated novel optical de novo assembly algorithm","bioinformatics","large-scale structures","human genomes","optical label based technology","large-scale genome analysis","computationally intensive alignment algorithm","sequential CPU","GPU","FPGA","sequential software baseline","multicore CPU design","design space exploration"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927499/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Hardware accelerated novel optical de novo assembly for large-scale genomes","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927499/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692941","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hardware accelerated novel optical de novo assembly for large-scale genomes","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w2c01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066903S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927499","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927500,"authors":[{"name":"Raphael Polig","affiliation":["IBM Research - Zurich, Rueschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Raphael","lastName":"Polig","id":"37072132000"},{"name":"Kubilay Atasu","affiliation":["IBM Research - Zurich, Rueschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Kubilay","lastName":"Atasu","id":"37282505100"},{"name":"Heiner Giefers","affiliation":["IBM Research - Zurich, Rueschlikon, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Heiner","lastName":"Giefers","id":"37584892200"},{"name":"Laura Chiticariu","affiliation":["IBM Research - Almaden, San Jose, CA, USA"],"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Chiticariu","id":"38131104000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927500","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":277},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927500","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hardware","Field programmable gate arrays","Software","Database languages","Libraries","Hardware design languages","Acceleration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","program compilers","query languages","query processing","text analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["text analytics query compilation","FPGA","information extraction","general-purpose processors","large scale text analytics","compiler","operator library","Verilog processing pipeline","AQL annotation query language","configurable modules","relational task","extraction task","full annotation operator graph representation","text processing","Stratix IV FPGA","POWER7 server"]}],"abstract":"Extracting information from unstructured text data is a compute-intensive task.

The operator library comprises a set of configurable modules capable of performing relational and extraction tasks which can be assembled by the compiler to represent a full annotation operator graph. Leveraging the nature of text processing we show that most tasks can be performed in an efficient streaming fashion. We evaluate the performance, power consumption and hardware utilization of our approach for a set of different queries compiled to a Stratix IV FPGA.

To simplify the implementation process and make the hardware pGA designs accessible to potential non-expert users, this paper proposes a general-purpose framework, which takes in a high-level description of the optimisation target and automatically generates pGA designs for FPGAs. Our pGA system exploits the two levels of parallelism found in GA instances and genetic operations, allowing users to tailor the architecture for resource constraints at compile-time. The framework also enables users to tune a subset of parameters at run-time without time-consuming recompilation. Our pGA design is more flexible than previous ones, and has an average speedup of 26 times compared to the multi-core counterparts over five combinatorial and numerical optimisation problems. When compared with a GPU, it also shows a 6.8 times speedup over a combinatorial application.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Automated framework for FPGA-based parallel genetic algorithms","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927501","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927501.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927501","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927501/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Automated framework for FPGA-based parallel genetic algorithms","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927501/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692823","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Automated framework for FPGA-based parallel genetic algorithms","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w2c03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063932S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927501","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927502,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas Becher","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Becher","id":"37085431511"},{"name":"Florian Bauer","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Florian","lastName":"Bauer","id":"37085433211"},{"name":"Daniel Ziener","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Ziener","id":"37300389000"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Teich","affiliation":["Hardware/Software Co-Design, Friedrich-Alexander-Universit\u00e4t Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg (FAU), Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Teich","id":"37334343700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927502","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":794},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927502","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Hardware","Throughput","Libraries","Switches","Databases"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["embedded systems","energy consumption","field programmable gate arrays","flexible electronics","power aware computing","SQL","system-on-chip"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["energy-aware SQL query acceleration","FPGA-based dynamic partial reconfiguration","embedded devices","query-specific hardware accelerator","query execution","pre-synthesized partial bitstream","flexible FPGA-based query accelerator approach","embedded low-energy system-on-chip platform","Xilinx Zynq SoC platform","high-end database servers","energy consumption","in-memory database system","module library"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we propose an approach for energy-aware FPGA-based query acceleration for databases on embedded devices.

The implementation of this flexible FPGA-based query accelerator approach on the embedded low-energy system-on-chip (SoC) platform Xilinx Zynq shows SQL query processing speeds comparable to high-end database servers, however, at a much lower energy consumption.

The run-time power gating approach is applied to Xilinx ZYNQ devices that incorporate a hardened Cortex A9 multi-processor. The paper demonstrates that power down followed by a full reconfiguration can be controlled by the embedded processor autonomously. The results show that the minimum time that the FPGA fabric must remain in power-off state for the technique to be energy efficient is in the order of milliseconds and up to 96% power reduction occurs when the fabric voltage is lowered below critical level.

One recently trend to alleviate the power wall in FPGAs is to turn off inactive regions of the silicon die, referred to as dark silicon. This paper presents a reconfigurable architecture to enable effective fine-grained power gating of unused Logic Blocks (LBs) in FPGAs. In the proposed architecture, the traditional soft logic is replaced with Mega Cells (MCs), each consists of a set of complementary Generic Reconfigurable Hard Logic (GRHL) and a conventional Look-Up Table (LUT). Both GRHL cells and LUTs can be power gated and turned off by controlling configuration bits. In the proposed MC, only one cell is active and the others are turned off. Experimental results on MCNC benchmark suite reveal that the proposed architecture reduces the critical path delay, power, and Power Delay Product (PDP) of LBs up to 5.3%, 30.4%, and 28.8% as compared to the equivalent LUT-based architecture.","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927504","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927504.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927504","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Towards dark silicon era in FPGAs using complementary hard logic design","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927504/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Towards dark silicon era in FPGAs using complementary hard logic design","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927504/","accessionNumber":"14692857","publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Towards dark silicon era in FPGAs using complementary hard logic design","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w3b02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066927S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927504","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6927505,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Jacobsen","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Jacobsen","id":"37078067900"},{"name":"Siddarth Sampangi","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Siddarth","lastName":"Sampangi","id":"37085357363"},{"name":"Yoav Freund","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Yoav","lastName":"Freund","id":"37284934800"},{"name":"Ryan Kastner","affiliation":["Computer Science & Engineering, University of California, San Diego"],"firstName":"Ryan","lastName":"Kastner","id":"37266396600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-3-00-044645-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1946-147X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1946-1488"}],"articleNumber":"6927505","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":141},"abstract":"Robust real time tracking is a requirement for many emerging applications. Many of these applications must track objects even as their appearance changes. Training classifiers online has become an effective approach for dealing with variability in object appearance. Classifiers can learn and adapt to changes online at the cost of additional runtime computation. In this paper, we propose a FPGA accelerated design of an online boosting algorithm that uses multiple classifiers to track and recover objects in real time. Our algorithm uses a novel method for training and comparing pose-specific classifiers along with adaptive tracking classifiers. Our FPGA accelerated design is able to track at 60 frames per second while concurrently evaluating 11 classifiers. This represents a 30\u00d7 speed up over a CPU based software implementation. It also demonstrates tracking accuracy at state of the art levels on a standard set of videos.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6913605/6927322/06927505.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","publicationTitle":"2014 24th International Conference on Field Programmable Logic and Applications (FPL)","doi":"10.1109/FPL.2014.6927505","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FPL.2014.6927505","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927322","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927505","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improving FPGA accelerated tracking with multiple online trained classifiers","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Training","Target tracking","Field programmable gate arrays","Acceleration","Runtime","Algorithm design and analysis","Boosting"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","image classification","integrated circuit design","object tracking","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust real time tracking","multiple online trained classifiers","object appearance","runtime computation","FPGA accelerated design","online boosting algorithm","pose-specific classifiers","adaptive tracking classifiers","CPU based software implementation","tracking accuracy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927505/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Improving FPGA accelerated tracking with multiple online trained classifiers","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927505/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14692942","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving FPGA accelerated tracking with multiple online trained classifiers","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w3c01.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069006S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927505","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927507,"authors":[{"name":"Kizheppatt Vipin","affiliation":["School of Computer Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kizheppatt","lastName":"Vipin","id":"38234646500"},{"name":"Suhaib A.

However, such systems only support static FPGA designs. With the addition of partial reconfiguration (PR) support, such frameworks can enable more effective use of FPGAs. Now, designers can incorporate hardware accelerators within their software applications, and these can be loaded dynamically as required. We present a PR-enabled FPGA platform that allows user modules to be loaded onto the FPGA, inputs to be applied, results obtained, and functions to be swapped at runtime. The interface and PR management logic are part of the static region, while multiple accelerators can be loaded using high level functions provided by the API. Reconfiguration and data transfer are both managed over the PCIe interface from the host PC, with communication throughput of more than 1.5 GB/s (75% of peak PCIe bandwidth) and reconfiguration of a large accelerator in 20 ms.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927507/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","accessionNumber":"14692893","htmlLink":"/document/6927507/","conferenceDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"DyRACT: A partial reconfiguration enabled accelerator and test platform","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DyRACT: A partial reconfiguration enabled accelerator and test platform","confLoc":"Munich, Germany","sourcePdf":"w3c03.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066875S","chronDate":"2-4 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6913605","isNumber":"6927322","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6913605","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6927322","articleId":"6927507","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Technical University of Munich (TUM)","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6927605,"authors":[{"name":"Su Jeong Choi","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineerning Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Su Jeong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37085405032"},{"name":"Hyun Je Song","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineerning Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Hyun Je","lastName":"Song","id":"37649632100"},{"name":"Seong Bae Park","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineerning Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Seong Bae","lastName":"Park","id":"37423511600"},{"name":"Sang Jo Lee","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineerning Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sang Jo","lastName":"Lee","id":"37293431600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4143-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927605","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":108},"abstract":"Point of interest (POI) categorization is the task of finding of categories of POIs within a document. Because the documents that possess POIs have clue words for identifying POI categories, the task can be solved as document classification. However, this approach misses two crucial factors for identifying the category of a POI. First, the approach pays no attention to onomastic information, even though POI names reveal much categorical information in many cases. Second, the approach ignores the fact that most clue words for identifying a POI category are located near the POI name. This paper proposes a novel method that incorporates both onomastic and local contextual information in POI categorization. The proposed method uses support vector machines (SVMs) to categorize POIs. In order to utilize the onomastic information of POIs, The proposed method adopts the string kernel that manages variations of the POI names efficiently at the character level. The method also proposes a Gaussian weighting to content words in a document. By setting the mean of a Gaussian weighting at the position of a POI name, the method imposes higher weights to the words near the POI name and lower weights to the words far from the name. Then, these two types of information are combined by a composite kernel of the string kernel and a linear kernel with the Gaussian weighting. A series of experiments prove that SVMs with the combined information outperforms those with single information.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923036/6927590/06927605.pdf","startPage":"38","endPage":"45","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)","doi":"10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.78","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.78","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927590","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927605","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A POI Categorization by Composition of Onomastic and Contextual Information","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kernel","Context","Vectors","Equations","Support vector machines","Marine animals"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["document handling","Gaussian processes","pattern classification","support vector machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["POI categorization","contextual information composition","onomastic information composition","point of interest categorization","document classification","support vector machines","SVM","string kernel","Gaussian weighting","composite kernel","linear kernel"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["POI categorization","Onomastic information","Contextual information","Kernel composition"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927605/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A POI Categorization by Composition of Onomastic and Contextual Information","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/6927605/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14686791","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"11-14 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A POI Categorization by Composition of Onomastic and Contextual Information","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"4143b038.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.094975S","chronDate":"11-14 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923036","isNumber":"6927590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923036","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6927590","articleId":"6927605","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-15"},{"_id":6927623,"authors":[{"name":"Changliang Li","affiliation":["Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, BEIJING, CHINA"],"firstName":"Changliang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085410798"},{"name":"Bo Xu","affiliation":["Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, BEIJING, CHINA"],"firstName":"Bo","lastName":"Xu","id":"37276981500"},{"name":"Gaowei Wu","affiliation":["Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, BEIJING, CHINA"],"firstName":"Gaowei","lastName":"Wu","id":"37085422453"},{"name":"Saike He","affiliation":["Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, BEIJING, CHINA"],"firstName":"Saike","lastName":"He","id":"37073013700"},{"name":"Guanhua Tian","affiliation":["Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, BEIJING, CHINA"],"firstName":"Guanhua","lastName":"Tian","id":"37085402086"},{"name":"Hongwei Hao","affiliation":["Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences, BEIJING, CHINA"],"firstName":"Hongwei","lastName":"Hao","id":"37558170600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4143-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927623","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":19,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":898},"abstract":"Sentiment analysis has now become a popular research problem to tackle in NLP field.

Furthermore, we introduce a novel Recursive Neural Deep Model (RNDM) to predict sentiment label based on recursive deep learning. We consider the problem of classifying one sentence by overall sentiment, determining a review is positive or negative.

We further compare the theoretical maximum accuracy with the accuracy obtained by the current state-of-the-art methods, and propose an influential friend selection strategy, hoping to narrow the gap between them. More precisely, we define several features to measure the friends' influence on a user's locations, based on which we put forth a sequential random walk with restart procedure to rank the friends in terms of their influence. By dynamically selecting the top N influential friends of the user per time slice, we propose a temporal-spatial Bayesian model to characterize the dynamics of friends' influence for location prediction.

However, when unseen data samples are added to the data set, the necessity of retraining becomes a barrier to the application of multi-manifold learning algorithms as preprocessing step in predictive modeling. In this paper, an incremental out-of-sample data low dimensional coordinates prediction approach is proposed to solve the out-of-sample data problem for multi-manifold. The algorithm can learn a global low dimensional structure with randomly sampled data from each class in the first step, and can compute the low dimensional coordinates on the corresponding manifold for each new coming data effectively. The algorithm is evaluated using both synthetic and real-world datasets and the results are shown both qualitatively and quantitatively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manifolds","Distributed databases","Prediction algorithms","Measurement","Accuracy","Algorithm design and analysis","Matrix decomposition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incremental multimanifold out-of-sample data prediction","multimanifold learning algorithm","compact representation","intrinsic dimensionality","manifold learning algorithms","predictive modeling","incremental out-of-sample data low dimensional coordinates prediction approach","out-of-sample data problem","global low dimensional structure","synthetic dataset","real-world dataset"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["dimensionality reduction","multi-manifold","out-of-sample data","incremental","prediction"]}],"doi":"10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.137","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conferences on Web Intelligence (WI) and Intelligent Agent Technologies (IAT)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923036/6927590/06927664.pdf","startPage":"481","endPage":"486","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927590","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/WI-IAT.2014.137","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Incremental Multi-manifold Out-of-Sample Data Prediction","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927664","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Incremental Multi-manifold Out-of-Sample Data Prediction","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927664/","isConference":true,"volume":"2","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927664/","accessionNumber":"14686805","conferenceDate":"11-14 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Aug. 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Incremental Multi-manifold Out-of-Sample Data Prediction","confLoc":"Warsaw, Poland","sourcePdf":"4143b481.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071975S","chronDate":"11-14 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923036","isNumber":"6927590","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923036","xplore-issue":"6927590","articleId":"6927664","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6927715,"authors":[{"name":"Syed Fahad Yunas","affiliation":["Dept.

The analysis covers both indoor and outdoor use cases, and the performance of the deployment strategies is evaluated in terms of network coverage, spectral and energy efficiency. The obtained results indicate that the indoor performance of pure macrocellular network in terms of coverage, capacity and energy efficiency is highly degraded with increasing wall penetration losses of modern buildings. Hence, the best strategy to overcome this problem is by deploying indoor femtocells, whose indoor performance is shown to actually benefit from increased BPLs. However, the outdoor performance of pure femtocell deployment is shown to degrade due to increased BPLs. Stemming from this, a heterogeneous Macro-Femto co-channel deployment solution is also analyzed and shown to deliver a balanced performance for both outdoor and indoor environments in terms of coverage, capacity and energy efficiency. These findings strongly motivate towards heterogeneous network deployments in the future, where indoor network elements play an increasingly important role.","doi":"10.1109/LCNW.2014.6927715","publicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks Workshops","displayPublicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916489/6927672/06927715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCNW.2014.6927715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927672","startPage":"643","endPage":"651","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Deployment strategies and performance analysis of Macrocell and Femtocell networks in suburban environment with modern buildings","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Deployment strategies and performance analysis of Macrocell and Femtocell networks in suburban environment with modern buildings","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927715/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14694344","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927715/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Deployment strategies and performance analysis of Macrocell and Femtocell networks in suburban environment with modern buildings","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p643yunas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089926S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916489","isNumber":"6927672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916489","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6927672","articleId":"6927715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927720,"authors":[{"name":"Andreas L\u00f6f","affiliation":["University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"L\u00f6f","id":"37974448900"},{"name":"Richard Nelson","affiliation":["University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand"],"firstName":"Richard","lastName":"Nelson","id":"37650664700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-3784-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-3782-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927720","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":570},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Ports (Computers)","Semantics","Accuracy","Software","IP networks","Reliability","Intrusion detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data handling","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network trace data","data annotation","network operations","security monitoring","network anomaly detection","data sharing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["anomaly detection","passive data collection","annotations"]}],"abstract":"Anomaly detection holds significant promise for automating network operations and security monitoring.

This paper presents a new annotation format allowing network datasets to be annotated with arbitrary event data. Use of the new format is demonstrated in a method to create new datasets that retain more information than a simple network capture. The supporting tools for the annotation format allow for incorporating events from multiple different sources.

This article analyzes network densification from the different deployment options perspective by looking into three mainstream technologies; Macrocells, Microcells, and Femtocells. The technologies are evaluated in a suburban neighborhood with modern residential houses. As majority of the data traffic in the network is believed to be generated by indoor users, we make a techno-economic analysis and comparison of the different deployment strategies from the indoor local area service provisioning viewpoint. Results show superior performance of low power indoor femtocell based deployment solutions in terms of coverage, capacity, energy and cost efficiency as compared to the outdoor solutions. Densifying the traditional pure Macro or Micro layers does provide improvement in the indoor coverage levels, however, due to the closer proximity of the co-channel interfering sites, the achievable capacity in the indoor environment deteriorates, which in turn also affects the energy and cost efficiency. These findings strongly motivate towards ultra dense deployments, based on indoor femtocell solutions, for addressing the local area capacity needs of the emerging future 5G networks.","doi":"10.1109/LCNW.2014.6927733","displayPublicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks Workshops","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916489/6927672/06927733.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927672","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LCNW.2014.6927733","publicationTitle":"39th Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks Workshops","startPage":"768","endPage":"776","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Techno-economical analysis and comparison of legacy and ultra-dense small cell networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927733","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Techno-economical analysis and comparison of legacy and ultra-dense small cell networks","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927733/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927733/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2014","accessionNumber":"14694316","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Techno-economical analysis and comparison of legacy and ultra-dense small cell networks","confLoc":"Edmonton, AB, Canada","promoFlag":"true","sourcePdf":"p768yunas.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06112S","chronDate":"8-11 Sept. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916489","isNumber":"6927672","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916489","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6927672","articleId":"6927733","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6927740,"authors":[{"name":"Mohammed Al-Shuraifi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Brunel University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Mohammed","lastName":"Al-Shuraifi","id":"37085354608"},{"name":"Hamed Al-Raweshidy","affiliation":["Department of Computer Engineering, Brunel University, London, UK"],"firstName":"Hamed","lastName":"Al-Raweshidy","id":"37085346027"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4233-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927740","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":453},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO","Transmitting antennas","Vectors","Channel capacity","Receiving antennas","Mathematical model"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","channel capacity","computational complexity","MIMO communication","radio receivers","radio transmitters","transmitting antennas","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel column vector","exhaustive search complexity reduction","transmitter","receiver","channel capacity equation","antenna selection optimization","channel state information","CSI","massive MIMO system","massive multiple input multiple output system"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","antenna subset selection","Channel State Information CSI"]}],"abstract":"This paper introduces an efficient model of antenna selection for Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems.

If the network traffic exhibits LRD behavior during normal conditions, then deviation from this property can indicate an abnormality in the traffic. We analyze and evaluate recent Internet traffic captured at King Saud University (KSU). The results and analysis of the proposed approach show that the presence of short duration anomalies affect the LRD behavior of certain traffic subgroups, namely the subgroups in the control plane traffic while the aggregated whole traffic still exhibits LRD. These results show how this approach significantly reduces the amount of traffic to analyze, and more importantly it can detect abnormal behavior that is not detected when looking the traffic as a whole.","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth edition of the International Conference on the Innovative Computing Technology (INTECH 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916662/6927737/06927746.pdf","startPage":"52","endPage":"57","publicationTitle":"Fourth edition of the International Conference on the Innovative Computing Technology (INTECH 2014)","doi":"10.1109/INTECH.2014.6927746","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTECH.2014.6927746","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927737","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927746","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Volume based anomaly detection using LRD analysis of decomposed network traffic","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Telecommunication traffic","Internet","Optimization methods","Educational institutions","Computer crime","Monitoring"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet","telecommunication traffic"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["abnormal behavior detection","control plane traffic","Internet traffic","enterprise network","decomposed network traffic subgroups","LRD behavior","long-range dependence behavior","computer networks","security threats","computer systems","network traffic intrusions","LRD analysis","volume based anomaly detection"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["LRD","self-similarity","traffic analysis","control and data planes traffic","anomaly detection","Optimization method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927746/","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Volume based anomaly detection using LRD analysis of decomposed network traffic","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6927746/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14694346","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Volume based anomaly detection using LRD analysis of decomposed network traffic","confLoc":"Luton, UK","sourcePdf":"127.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.089774S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916662","isNumber":"6927737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916662","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6927737","articleId":"6927746","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6927752,"authors":[{"name":"Haiwei Yang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Haiwei","lastName":"Yang","id":"37088559856"},{"name":"Fei Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China"],"firstName":"Fei","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085369122"},{"name":"Yu Song","affiliation":["School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, CN"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Song","id":"37088559002"},{"name":"Lei Chen","affiliation":["Beijing Institute of Spacecraft System Engineering, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Chen","id":"37085389208"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-4233-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6927752","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Three-dimensional displays","Estimation","Linear programming","Convergence","Genetic algorithms","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer vision","genetic algorithms","object detection","pose estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["simultaneous pose-correspondence estimation","3D object pose","initialization method","genetic algorithm","initial value estimation","computer vision","2D image points","3D object points","single 2D image"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["pose estimation","correspondence","initialization","genetic algorithm"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927752","abstract":"Simultaneous pose and correspondence estimation problem is used to determine the pose of a 3D object from a single 2D image when corresponding relation is unknown between 3D object points and 2D image points.

However, all the state-of-art algorithms rely on appropriate initialization and the correct solution may not be reached to in many times with the traditional initialization method which starts randomly. We derive a novel method which estimates the initial value based on genetic algorithm, considering the influences of different initial guesses comprehensively. Using this initialization method, the proper initial guess could be calculated and the simultaneous pose and correspondence problem could be easily solved.

Due to ongoing improvement in wireless technology, the numbers of users and applications increase rapidly. At the same time, wireless communication need the high data rate and link reliability. Therefore, MU-MIMO improvements have to consider 1) providing the high data rate and link reliability, 2) support all users in the same and frequency resource, and 3) using low power consumption. In practice, inter-user interference has a strong impact when more users access the wireless link. Complicated transmission techniques such as interference cancellation are used to maintain a given desired quality of service. Due to these problems, MU-MIMO systems with very large antenna arrays (known as massive MIMO) are proposed. With massive MU-MIMO systems, we mean a hundred or more serving tens of users. The channel vectors are nearly orthogonal, and the inter-user interference is reduced significantly. Therefore, the users can be served with high data rate simultaneously. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the massive MU-MIMO downlink system in a single cell where the base station utilizes linear precoding schemes to serve many users over the Rayleigh fading channel.","doi":"10.1109/INTECH.2014.6927765","publicationTitle":"Fourth edition of the International Conference on the Innovative Computing Technology (INTECH 2014)","displayPublicationTitle":"Fourth edition of the International Conference on the Innovative Computing Technology (INTECH 2014)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916662/6927737/06927765.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/INTECH.2014.6927765","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6927737","startPage":"219","endPage":"224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of linear precoding schemes for very large Multi-user MIMO downlink system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6927765","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of linear precoding schemes for very large Multi-user MIMO downlink system","chronOrPublicationDate":"13-15 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6927765/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"13-15 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14694377","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6927765/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of linear precoding schemes for very large Multi-user MIMO downlink system","confLoc":"Luton, UK","sourcePdf":"156.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.102497S","chronDate":"13-15 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916662","isNumber":"6927737","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916662","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"6927737","articleId":"6927765","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6927788,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A signal processor controls the excitation of antenna array elements to synthesize a desired radiation pattern with the general objective to increase gain in the direction of intended receivers or wanted signal sources and reduce gain in the direction of known or potential sources of interference. In the context of a cognitive radio network, where interference mitigation is a paramount concern, beamforming and precoding techniques offer significant advantages in terms of spectral efficiency, power control, link capacity, transmission security, and improved signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR). Cognitive beamforming approaches the selection of array coefficients as a convex optimization problem in a machine-learning algorithm. A cognitive engine stores previously derived solutions in a knowledge base and autonomously applies beamforming decisions toward the ultimate goal of predicting channel conditions and proactively adjusting antenna array patterns to maintain network connectivity and performance. This informed decision-making ability distinguishes cognitive beamformers as an evolution of traditional adaptive arrays and smart antenna systems. This paper presents a survey of various cognitive beamforming techniques in interweave, overlay, and underlay networks. Algorithms are categorized based on their applicability to multiple-input, single output (MISO) or multiple-input, multiple output (MIMO) systems and any constraints or idealization of channel state information and quality of service metrics. The techniques evaluated include distributed, joint, and cooperative beamforming strategies with optimization schemes based in game theory, communication informatics, neural networking, and genetic algorithms.

When codes are used, the matched filter is often applied during processing to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detection and analysis. In the case of moving targets with unknown velocity (e.g. meteor head echoes) or the general case when the entire frequency spectrum of a signal is of interest (e.g. incoherent scatter or multiple scatterers with different Doppler shifts), a bank of matched filters is used, each adapted to a different frequency. One problem with most codes and their corresponding matched filter is processing sidelobes: spurious signal appearing at non-target locations in the range-frequency matched filtered result. One approach for minimizing or eliminating sidelobes is to use a non-matched filter. Often this is an inverse filter that results in no range sidelobes at the cost of reduced SNR. Another approach is to employ codes that minimize sidelobes (Barker, LFM chirp, or minimum peak sidelobe codes) or practically eliminate them (perfect codes) when the matched filter is used. Whether mismatched or matched filters are used, both approaches are typically formulated to minimize range sidelobes but ignore frequency sidelobes. A new approach is needed to decode complex scatterers which require discrimination in both range and frequency. Since in principle the form of the sidelobes is known by knowing the code, inversion is another option for removing sidelobes. The difficulty is that the inverse problem is underdetermined, so an infinite number of solutions can be found that fit the radar measurements. Fortunately, in radar applications we typically have knowledge that the target has a sparse representation in range and frequency, and we can use this a-priori knowledge to find a unique solution. In this talk, we describe the concept of Iterative Thresholding Matched Filters for performing inversion on the radar signal to remove range-frequency sidelobes. This technique is applicable using a wide range of codes provided that the target signal is sparse in the range-frequency domain. First, we introduce the inversion concept by formulating a radar model that is the adjoint of the range-frequency matched filter. We then present the results of an alternative model derivation that shows the conditions under which sparsity is preserved when going from a continuous to discrete target representation; of particular interest is the important case of arbitrarily-located point targets. The model is under-determined by definition, but the sparsity assumption allows us to turn to the theory of compressed sensing in order to get a unique solution. The inversion process requires solving a convex optimization problem, and we discuss different first-order algorithms for solving large instances of this problem. Since the solution procedure for all of these involves an iterative procedure of thresholding and matched filtering, we call these techniques Iterative Thresholding Matched Filters.

The normal types of time frequency (TF) analysis algorithms have been widely used in the nonstationary condition. But those methods show imperfection for drastically changing vibration signal. Synchrosqueezing Transform (SST) is an adaptive and invertible transform. However, the original SST method is not suitable for vibration signals with abruptly instantanous frequency (IF). In this paper, SST based on adaptive short time Fourier transform(ASTFT) is proposed to improve the time resolution of drastically changing vibration signal. Compared with Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT), SST and Generalized Synchrosqueezing Transform (GST) based on STFT, SST based on ASTFT is of good performance with high computing speed. Experiments were conducted by using SQI motor simulator to validate the proposed method. The vibration signals of a motor with fault were collected during the run-down process and analysed by the proposed method.The results showed that the fault feature frequency of the motor can be accurately captured, which suggests that the proposed approach is effective for analyzing the actute variation signals.","doi":"10.1109/FENDT.2014.6928290","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Far East Forum on Nondestructive Evaluation/Testing","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE Far East Forum on Nondestructive Evaluation/Testing","pdfPath":"/iel7/6917159/6928221/06928290.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FENDT.2014.6928290","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928221","startPage":"329","endPage":"334","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new improved Synchrosqueezing Transform based on adaptive short time fourier transform","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928290","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new improved Synchrosqueezing Transform based on adaptive short time fourier transform","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-23 June 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928290/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"20-23 June 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14694395","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6928290/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new improved Synchrosqueezing Transform based on adaptive short time fourier transform","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053724S","chronDate":"20-23 June 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6917159","isNumber":"6928221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6917159","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6928221","articleId":"6928290","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6928409,"authors":[{"name":"Irfan Al-Anbagi","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/9739/7393921/6928409/alanb-2363950-small.gif","p":["\nIrfan Al-Anbagi received the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer \nengineering from the University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada, in 2013.

However, successful deployment of resource-limited WSNs in such applications requires strict quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning techniques to meet the desired latency and reliability targets of those applications. Implementation of QoS techniques in WSNs is significantly challenging since WSNs have been initially devised for low-data-rate non-real-time applications. Therefore, WSN designers and developers resort to different cross-layer interaction and optimization techniques to provision QoS in WSNs. In this paper, we present a survey on the state of the art of cross-layer QoS approaches in wireless terrestrial sensor networks to achieve delay and reliability bounds in critical applications. Our paper provides a unique classification of cross-layer QoS approaches in WSNs that allows surveying a large amount of studies with utmost clarity. Furthermore, we highlight the main challenges of implementing QoS protocols in WSNs and present an overview of QoS-aware WSN applications.","doi":"10.1109/COMST.2014.2363950","publicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials","pdfPath":"/iel7/9739/7393921/06928409.pdf","startPage":"525","endPage":"552","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7393921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/COMST.2014.2363950","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Survey on Cross-Layer Quality-of-Service Approaches in WSNs for Delay and Reliability-Aware Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928409","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Firstquarter  2016","displayDocTitle":"A Survey on Cross-Layer Quality-of-Service Approaches in WSNs for Delay and Reliability-Aware Applications","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928409/","publicationDate":"Firstquarter 2016","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"15730357","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928409/","volume":"18","issue":"1","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003400","fundingName":"Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science","grantNumber":"ORF-RE-02-009"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Survey on Cross-Layer Quality-of-Service Approaches in WSNs for Delay and Reliability-Aware Applications","sourcePdf":"comst-mouftah-2363950-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.349317S","chronDate":"Firstquarter  2016","xplore-pub-id":"9739","isNumber":"7393921","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"9739","citationCount":"69","xplore-issue":"7393921","articleId":"6928409","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2016","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6928411,"authors":[{"name":"Ding Ni","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ding","lastName":"Ni","id":"37085334590"},{"name":"Hongbing Ma","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hongbing","lastName":"Ma","id":"37896992900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1545-598X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0571"}],"articleNumber":"6928411","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":554},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society","url":"http://www.grss-ieee.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Manifolds","Training","Approximation methods","Hyperspectral imaging","Robustness","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","geophysical image processing","hyperspectral imaging","image classification","image representation","image sampling","learning (artificial intelligence)"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyperspectral image classification","tangent space","sparse image representation","low-dimensional manifold","image sampling","tangent plane approximation","HSI","spectrum mixing","training sample"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Classification","hyperspectral image (HSI)","manifold","sparse representation","tangent space"]},{"kwd":["Classification","hyperspectral image (HSI)","manifold","sparse representation","tangent space"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928411","doi":"10.1109/LGRS.2014.2362512","publicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","abstract":"In many real-world problems, data always lie in a low-dimensional manifold. Exploiting the manifold can greatly enhance the discrimination between different categories. In this letter, we propose a classification framework based on sparse representation to directly exploit the underlying manifold. Specifically, using the tangent plane to approximate the local manifold of each test sample, the proposed method classifies the sample by sparse representation in tangent space. Unlike several existing sparse-representation-based classification methods, which sparsely represent the test sample itself, the proposed method sparsely represents the local manifold of the test sample by tangent plane approximation. Therefore, it goes beyond the sample itself and is more robust to kinds of variations confronted in hyperspectral image (HSI) such as illustration differences and spectrum mixing. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for the classification of HSI with limited training samples.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LGRS.2014.2362512","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6942298","startPage":"786","endPage":"790","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel7/8859/6942298/06928411.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classification of Hyperspectral Image Based on Sparse Representation in Tangent Space","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928411/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6928411/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Classification of Hyperspectral Image Based on Sparse Representation in Tangent Space","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","accessionNumber":"14754457","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"12","issue":"4","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National High Technology Research and Development Program of China","grantNumber":"2007AA12Z149"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Classification of Hyperspectral Image Based on Sparse Representation in Tangent Space","sourcePdf":"lgrs-ni-2362512-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.167907S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8859","isNumber":"6942298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8859","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6942298","articleId":"6928411","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6928414,"authors":[{"name":"Dadi Meng","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Technology in Geospatial Information Processing and Applied System, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/36/7001732/6928414/meng-2361134-small.gif","p":["\nDadi Meng was born in Shaanxi, China, in 1979.

Due to range-azimuth coupling and computational burden consideration, some approximations, which are valid for SAR systems of moderate aperture length, are usually adopted in commonly used MOCO approaches. However, a much more accurate SAR data processing approach is appealing to process the low-frequency SAR systems with large aperture length, such as P-band. In this paper, a new MOCO approach with high precision and high efficiency is proposed. After the \u03c9 - \u03ba processing and the range-dependent MOCO, the analytical expression of a 2-D spectrum of a partially focused SAR image is given. Afterward, aperture reduction is achieved by a chirp modulation technique. Finally, with high precision and less computation cost, back projection along the new built short apertures (affected by the residual motion errors) is employed to yield a fairly well-focused SAR image. Experimental results on simulated and actual P-band SAR data are presented to verify the performance of the proposed approach.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2014.2361134","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel7/36/7001732/06928414.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2014.2361134","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7001732","startPage":"2510","endPage":"2519","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Precise Focusing of Airborne SAR Data With Wide Apertures Large Trajectory Deviations: A Chirp Modulated Back-Projection Approach","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Precise Focusing of Airborne SAR Data With Wide Apertures Large Trajectory Deviations: A Chirp Modulated Back-Projection Approach","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928414/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"53","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"14847925","dateOfInsertion":"07 January 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6928414/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61101200 and 61331017"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Precise Focusing of Airborne SAR Data With Wide Apertures Large Trajectory Deviations: A Chirp Modulated Back-Projection Approach","sourcePdf":"tgrs-meng-2361134-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073017S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"7001732","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"25","xplore-issue":"7001732","articleId":"6928414","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6928419,"authors":[{"name":"Siavash Pakdelian","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/60/7042861/6928419/pakde-small.gif","p":["Siavash Pakdelian (S\u201911) received the B.S. degree from Sharif\n University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, and the M.Sc. degree from the University of Tehran, Tehran, in 2006,\n both in electrical power engineering.

Once coupled with a conventional rotary machine, the resultant system may be used as a compact electromechanical motion system for high-force linear-motion applications, such as wave energy conversion.

The focus of this paper is the joint transmission scenario, where an ideal backhaul network allows a set of randomly located base stations, possibly belonging to different network tiers, to jointly transmit data, to mitigate intercell interference and hence improve coverage and spectral efficiency. Using tools from stochastic geometry, an integral expression for the network coverage probability is derived in the scenario where the typical user located at an arbitrary location, i.e., the general user, receives data from a pool of base stations that are selected based on their average received power levels. An expression for the coverage probability is also derived for the typical user located at the point equidistant from three base stations, which we refer to as the worst case user. In the special case where cooperation is limited to two base stations, numerical evaluations illustrate absolute gains in coverage probability of up to 17% for the general user and 24% for the worst case user compared with the noncooperative case. It is also shown that no diversity gain is achieved using noncoherent joint transmission, whereas full diversity gain can be achieved at the receiver if the transmitting base stations have channel state information.","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363660","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960951","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2014.2363660","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/26/6960951/06928420.pdf","startPage":"4134","endPage":"4146","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Coordinated Multipoint Joint Transmission in Heterogeneous Networks","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/26/6960951/6928420-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Coordinated Multipoint Joint Transmission in Heterogeneous Networks","volume":"62","issue":"11","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928420/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2014","accessionNumber":"14758936","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928420/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. NSF","grantNumber":"1117728 and 1216407"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Coordinated Multipoint Joint Transmission in Heterogeneous Networks","sourcePdf":"tcomm-nigam-2363660-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.1054S","chronDate":"Nov.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"6960951","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"182","xplore-issue":"6960951","articleId":"6928420","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6928422,"authors":[{"name":"Shahrouz Khalili","affiliation":["CWCSPR, Newark, USA"],"firstName":"Shahrouz","lastName":"Khalili","id":"37085594969"},{"name":"Osvaldo Simeone","affiliation":["CWCSPR, Newark, USA"],"firstName":"Osvaldo","lastName":"Simeone","id":"37269653500"},{"name":"Alexander M.

In the proposed algorithm, the map is described by grids in which nodes are defined on corners of grids. The planning algorithm considers the map as four areas, namely, implementation, observation, explored, and unknown. The Implementation area is a subset of the Observation area, whereas the Explored area is the union of all the previous Observation areas. The path is planned with a receding horizon planning strategy to generate waypoints and in-between map updates. When a new map update occurs, the path is replanned within the current Observation area if necessary. If no such path exists, the search is extended to the Explored area. Paths can be planned by recursively searching available nodes inside the Explored area that can be connected to available nodes on the boundary of the Explored area. A robot platform is employed to conduct a series of experiments in a laboratory environment to verify the proposed path planning algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2014.2363632","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel7/41/7080969/06928427.pdf","startPage":"2912","endPage":"2920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7080969","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2014.2363632","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Recursive Receding Horizon Planning for Unmanned Vehicles","volume":"62","issue":"5","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928427/","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2015","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15036009","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928427/","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000104","fundingName":"National Aeronautics and Space Administration","grantNumber":"NNX09CB61C"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Recursive Receding Horizon Planning for Unmanned Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2363632-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137284S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7080969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"7080969","articleId":"6928427","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-16"},{"_id":6928428,"authors":[{"name":"En-Liang Hu","affiliation":["Department of Mathematics, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5962385/7206790/6928428/hu-2361159-small.gif","p":["En-Liang Hu received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China, in 2010.","He was a Research Assistant with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, from 2012 to 2013.He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Mathematics, Yunnan Normal University, Kunming, China.

The proposed hybrid precoding scheme, named phased-ZF (PZF), essentially applies phase-only control at the RF domain and then performs a low-dimensional baseband ZF precoding based on the effective channel seen from baseband. Heavily quantized RF phase control up to 2 bits of precision is also considered and shown to incur very limited degradation.

The propulsion system has two machines: One machine is operating mostly as a motor while the other machine is operating mostly as a generator. Both machines of the Volt electric drive system are permanent-magnet ac synchronous machine types with the magnets buried inside the rotor. The motor has distributed windings. However, as opposed to a conventional stranded winding, the Chevrolet Volt motor has bar-wound construction to improve the motor performance, particularly in the low to medium speed range. At higher speed, the skin and proximity effects in the stator bars lead to increased stator winding losses but are addressed in the design. The bar-wound construction also has excellent thermal performance, in both the steady-state and transient conditions, necessary for full electric vehicle (EV) driving. The generator uses concentrated windings. The concentrated winding construction has good slot fill and short end-turn length. These features resulted in good performance in the intended operational region and were an enabler for machine packaging inside the transmission. Both the machines exhibit excellent efficiency and exceptionally smooth and quiet operation. The machine design and construction details, as well as the measured thermal, electromagnetic, and acoustic noise performances, are presented in this paper.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928443/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May-June  2015","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"51","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May-June 2015","dateOfInsertion":"15 May 2015","htmlLink":"/document/6928443/","accessionNumber":"15142333","displayDocTitle":"Design and Performance of Electrical Propulsion System of Extended Range Electric Vehicle (EREV) Chevrolet Volt","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design and Performance of Electrical Propulsion System of Extended Range Electric Vehicle (EREV) Chevrolet Volt","sourcePdf":"tia-rahman-2363015-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.041701S","chronDate":"May-June  2015","xplore-pub-id":"28","isNumber":"7109193","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"28","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"7109193","articleId":"6928443","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6928445,"authors":[{"name":"Hesham ElSawy","affiliation":["King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/6960951/6928445/elsaw-2363849_print-small.gif","p":["\nHesham ElSawy received the B.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from\nAssiut University, Assiut, Egypt, in 2006, the M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Arab Academy for Science and\nTechnology, Alexandria, Egypt, in 2009, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Manitoba,\nWinnipeg, MB, Canada, in 2014.

We characterize in closed form, the probability density function (pdf) of the output of multiple-input and multiple-output block-fading channels, for an arbitrary signal-to-noise ratio value. Our results provide compact expressions for such output statistics, paving the way to a more detailed analytical information-theoretic exploration of communications in presence of block fading. The analysis is carried out assuming two different structures for the input signal: 1) the independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian distribution and 2) a product form that has been proved to be optimal for noncoherent communication, i.e., in absence of any channel state information. When the channel is fed by an i.i.d. Gaussian input, we assume the Gramian of the channel matrix to be unitarily invariant and derive the output statistics in both the noise- and interference-limited scenario, considering different fading distributions. When the product-form input is adopted, we provide the expressions of the output pdf as the relationship between the overall number of antennas and fading coherence length varies. We also highlight the relation between our newly derived expressions and the results already available in the literature, and, for some cases, we numerically compute the mutual information based on the proposed expression of the output statistics.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2363838","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6960944/06928448.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2363838","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960944","startPage":"7782","endPage":"7797","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Closed-Form Output Statistics of MIMO Block-Fading Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Closed-Form Output Statistics of MIMO Block-Fading Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928448/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"60","issue":"12","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14758896","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6928448/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"National Priorities Research Program through the Qatar National Research Fund, a member of Qatar Foundation","grantNumber":"5-782-2-322"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Closed-Form Output Statistics of MIMO Block-Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"tit-nordio-2363838-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.124888S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6960944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6960944","articleId":"6928448","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6928449,"authors":[{"name":"Biao Min","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong"],"firstName":"Biao","lastName":"Min","id":"38237152100"},{"name":"Ray C.

It provides the higher coding efficiency than the previous standard, H.264/Advanced Video Coding. The block partitioning in HEVC supports quad-tree-based coding unit (CU) structure from size 64\u00d764 to 8\u00d78. The new technique provides better performances on one hand, whereas on the other hand it also increases the coding complexity. In this paper, a novel fast algorithm is proposed for the CU size decision in intra coding. Both the global and local edge complexities in horizontal, vertical, 45\u00b0 diagonal, and 135\u00b0 diagonal directions are proposed and used to decide the partitioning of a CU. Coupled with handling its four sub-CUs in the same way, a CU is decided to be split, nonsplit, or undetermined for each depth. Compared with the reference software HM10.0, the encoding time is reduced by ~52% on average, with ~0.8% Bjontegaard Distortion-rate increasing and reasonable peak signal-to-noise ratio losses.","doi":"10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2363739","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/76/7100973/06928449.pdf","startPage":"892","endPage":"896","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSVT.2014.2363739","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7100973","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Fast CU Size Decision Algorithm for the HEVC Intra Encoder","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928449","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928449/","displayDocTitle":"A Fast CU Size Decision Algorithm for the HEVC Intra Encoder","volume":"25","issue":"5","publicationDate":"May 2015","accessionNumber":"15107646","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928449/","dateOfInsertion":"01 May 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Research Grants Council, Hong Kong","grantNumber":"CityU 123612"},{"fundingName":"Croucher Startup Allowance","grantNumber":"9500015"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Fast CU Size Decision Algorithm for the HEVC Intra Encoder","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-min-2363739-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079152S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7100973","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"96","xplore-issue":"7100973","articleId":"6928449","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6928457,"authors":[{"name":"Brian K.

Using a linear state-space model to estimate the behavior of the sum-product algorithm (SPA) decoder in the vicinity of trapping sets (TSs), we study the performance of the SPA decoder in the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) domain as a function of the LLR saturation level. When applied to several widely studied codes, the model accurately predicts a significant decrease in the error floor as the saturation level is allowed to increase. For nonsaturating decoders, however, we find that the state-space model breaks down after a small number of iterations due to the strong correlation of LLR messages. We then revisit Richardson's importance-sampling methodology for estimating error floors due to TSs when those floors are too low for Monte Carlo simulation. We propose modifications that account for the behavior of a nonsaturating decoder and present the resulting error floor estimates for the Margulis code. These estimates are much lower, significantly steeper, and more sensitive to iteration count than those previously reported.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2014.2363832","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel7/18/6960944/06928457.pdf","startPage":"7416","endPage":"7441","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6960944","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2014.2363832","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Error Floor Approximation for LDPC Codes in the AWGN Channel","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928457","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Error Floor Approximation for LDPC Codes in the AWGN Channel","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928457/","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14758897","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928457/","volume":"60","issue":"12","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Center for Magnetic Recording Research, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"},{"fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CCF-0829865 and CCF-1116739"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Error Floor Approximation for LDPC Codes in the AWGN Channel","sourcePdf":"tit-butler-2363832-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.188305S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"6960944","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"6960944","articleId":"6928457","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6928459,"authors":[{"name":"Zhao-Rong Lai","affiliation":["Intelligent Data Center and the Department of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7203181/6928459/lai-2361770-small.gif","p":["Zhao-Rong Lai received the B.Sc. degree in applied mathematics and the M.Sc. degree in information and computational science, both from the School of Mathematics and Computational Science, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2010 and 2012, respectively, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree in probability theory and mathematical statistics.","His current research interests include image processing, statistical machine learning, and multivariate statistical analysis."]},"firstName":"Zhao-Rong","lastName":"Lai","id":"37085458266"},{"name":"Dao-Qing Dai","affiliation":["Intelligent Data Center and the Department of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221036/7203181/6928459/dai-2361770-small.gif","p":["Dao-Qing Dai (M\u201907) received the B.Sc. degree in mathematics from Hunan Normal University, Changsha, China, the M.Sc. degree in mathematics from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, and the Ph.D. degree in mathematics from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 1983, 1986, and 1990, respectively.","From 1998 to 1999, he was an Alexander von Humboldt Research Fellow with Free University, Berlin, Germany.

They collaborate to tune regression codes of different properties (sparsity, compactness, high discriminating ability, etc.), to further improve robustness and adaptivity of the regression model. We propose two types of coding models: 1) multiscale error measurements that produces sparse and highly discriminative codes and 2) inspires within-class collaborative representation that produces sparse and compact codes. The update of codes and the combination of different errors are automatically processed. DCC is also robust to the choice of parameters, producing stable regression residuals which are crucial to classification. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that DCC has promising performance and outperforms other state-of-the-art regression models.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel7/6221036/7203181/06928459.pdf","startPage":"1900","endPage":"1912","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics","doi":"10.1109/TCYB.2014.2361770","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2361770","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7203181","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928459","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Discriminative and Compact Coding for Robust Face Recognition","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robustness","Measurement uncertainty","Collaboration","Training","Encoding","Face recognition","Adaptation models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["face recognition","image classification","image coding","image representation","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust face recognition","DCC","discriminative and compact coding","multiscale error measurements","within-class collaborative representation","stable regression residual model","benchmark datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Compactness","discriminative and compact coding (DCC)","multiple error measurements","robust face recognition","sparsity","within-class collaborative representation"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Biometric Identification","Databases, Factual","Face","Humans","Regression Analysis"]},{"kwd":["Compactness","discriminative and compact coding (DCC)","multiple error measurements","robust face recognition","sparsity","within-class collaborative representation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928459/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Discriminative and Compact Coding for Robust Face Recognition","volume":"45","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6928459/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15365157","pubMedId":"25343776","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"61203248, 11171354, 90920007, 61375033 and 61403164"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100002338","fundingName":"Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China","grantNumber":"SRFDP-20120171120007 and 20120171110016"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100003453","fundingName":"Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province","grantNumber":"S2013020012796"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100012226","fundingName":"Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities","grantNumber":"13lgpy26"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Discriminative and Compact Coding for Robust Face Recognition","sourcePdf":"tcyb-dai-2361770-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12358S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"6221036","isNumber":"7203181","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6221036","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"7203181","articleId":"6928459","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6928465,"authors":[{"name":"Khaled Mohammad Alawasa","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7080969/6928465/alawa-2363622-small.gif","p":["\nKhaled Mohammad Alawasa (S'09\u2013M'14) received the \nB.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from Mu'tah University, Al-Karak, Jordan, in 2000, the M.Sc. degree in power \nengineering from Strathclyde University, Glasgow, U.K., in 2008, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from \nthe University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada, in 2014.","He was an Engineer with the National Electric Power Company (NEPCO), Amman, Jordan, from 2001 to 2007 and a Power \nSystem Specialist with Magna IV, Edmonton, from 2012 to 2013.

The proposed subsynchronous resonance damping controller is based on reshaping the virtual output admittance of the interfacing VSC-based system to ensure positive damping in the vicinity of torsional modes. The proposed reshaping technique uses the voltage at the point of common coupling in cascaded compensators to magnify the positive resistance without using generator or turbine speed and/or torque perturbations.

The model has two stages: 1) distortion measurement and 2) nonlinear mapping. In the first stage, an unsigned ac band, three frequency bands, and two orientation bands are generated from the DCT coefficients of each decoded frame in a video sequence. Six efficient frame-level features are then extracted to quantify the distortion of natural scenes. In the second stage, each frame-level feature of all frames is transformed to a corresponding video-level feature via a temporal pooling, then a trained multilayer neural network takes all video-level features as inputs and outputs, a score as the predicted quality of the video sequence. The proposed method was tested on videos with various compression types, content, and resolution in four databases. We compared our model with a linear model, a support-vector-regression-based model, a state-of-the-art training-based model, and a four popular full-reference metrics. Detailed experimental results demonstrate that the results of the proposed method are highly correlated with the subjective assessments.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928467/","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"April 2015","dateOfInsertion":"01 April 2015","accessionNumber":"15035640","htmlLink":"/document/6928467/","displayDocTitle":"No-Reference Video Quality Assessment Based on Artifact Measurement and Statistical Analysis","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany"},{"fundingName":"Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"(No. 2015JJ1013)"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"No-Reference Video Quality Assessment Based on Artifact Measurement and Statistical Analysis","sourcePdf":"tcsvt-zhu-2363737-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.107772S","chronDate":"April  2015","xplore-pub-id":"76","isNumber":"7076665","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"76","citationCount":"39","xplore-issue":"7076665","articleId":"6928467","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6928473,"authors":[{"name":"Wangxin Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, The University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, AL, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/7080969/6928473/huang-2363817-small.gif","p":["\nWangxin Huang (S'12) received the B.Eng. degree in electrical \nengineering from Central South University, Changsha, China, in 2011.

The battery cells are decoupled from one another by connecting each cell with a small lower power dc-dc power converter. The small power converters are utilized to achieve both SOC balancing between the battery cells and dc bus voltage regulation at the same time. The battery cells' SOC imbalance issue is addressed from the root by using the energy sharing concept to automatically adjust the discharge/charge rate of each cell while maintaining a regulated dc bus voltage. Consequently, there is no need to transfer the excess energy between the cells for SOC balancing. The theoretical basis and experimental prototype results are provided to illustrate and validate the proposed energy sharing controller.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928473/","volume":"62","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6928473/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"15036003","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"May 2015","dateOfInsertion":"08 April 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy Sharing Control Scheme for State-of-Charge Balancing of Distributed Battery Energy Storage System","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Alabama National Aeronautics Space Administration Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Research Infrastructure Development","grantNumber":"NNX13AB09A"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy Sharing Control Scheme for State-of-Charge Balancing of Distributed Battery Energy Storage System","sourcePdf":"tie-abuqahouq-2363817-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066862S","chronDate":"May  2015","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"7080969","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"190","xplore-issue":"7080969","articleId":"6928473","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6928489,"authors":[{"name":"Faouzi Bellili","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, Qc, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Faouzi Bellili, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Faouzi","lastName":"Bellili","id":"37391785500"},{"name":"Rabii Meftehi","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, Qc, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Rabii Meftehi, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Rabii","lastName":"Meftehi","id":"37085459398"},{"name":"Sofi\u00e8ne Affes","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, Qc, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Sofi\u00e9ne Affes (SM'04) photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Sofi\u00e8ne","lastName":"Affes","id":"37265164500"},{"name":"Alex St\u00e9phenne","affiliation":["INRS-EMT, Montreal, Qc, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Alex St\u00e9phenne, photograph and biography not available at the time of publication."]},"firstName":"Alex","lastName":"St\u00e9phenne","id":"37294239900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1053-587X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0476"}],"articleNumber":"6928489","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":30,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":991},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.signalprocessingsociety.org"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal to noise ratio","Channel estimation","Maximum likelihood estimation","Approximation methods","Receivers","Time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","expectation-maximisation algorithm","fading channels","polynomials","signal detection","time-varying channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel variation","polynomial-in-time expansion","closed-form expression","DA ML estimator","unbiased DA estimator","Cramer-Rao lower bound","CRLB","log-likelihood function","LLF","expectation-maximization technique","NDA ML SNR estimation","EM-based NDA estimator","hard detection","iteration loop","computer simulation","instantaneous per-antenna SNR estimation","nondata-aided scheme","data-aided scheme","time-varying single input multiple output channel","signal-to-noise ratio ML estimation","time-varying flat-fading SIMO channel","linearly-modulated signal maximum likelihood SNR estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["CRLB","detection","expectation-maximization (EM)","ML estimation","SNR","time-varying SIMO channels"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we tackle for the first time the problem of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) parameter over time-varying single-input multiple-output (SIMO) channels. Both the data-aided (DA) and the non-data-aided (NDA) schemes are investigated. Unlike classical techniques where the channel is assumed to be slowly time-varying and, therefore, considered as constant over the entire observation period, we address the more challenging problem of instantaneous (i.e., short-term or local) SNR estimation over fast time-varying channels. The channel variations are tracked locally using a polynomial-in-time expansion. First, we derive in closed-form expressions the DA ML estimator and its bias. The latter is subsequently subtracted in order to obtain a unbiased DA estimator whose variance and the corresponding Cram\u00e9r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) are also derived in closed form. Due to the extreme nonlinearity of the log-likelihood function (LLF) in the NDA case, we resort to the expectation-maximization (EM) technique to iteratively obtain the exact NDA ML SNR estimates within very few iterations. Most remarkably, the new EM-based NDA estimator is applicable to any linearly-modulated signal and provides sufficiently accurate soft estimates (i.e., soft detection) for the unknown transmitted symbols. Therefore, hard detection can be easily embedded in the iteration loop in order to improve its performance at low SNR levels. We show by extensive computer simulations that the new estimators are able to accurately estimate the instantaneous per-antenna SNRs as they coincide with the DA CRLB over a wide range of practical SNRs.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2364017","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6980168/06928489.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2364017","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6980168","startPage":"441","endPage":"456","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Likelihood SNR Estimation of Linearly-Modulated Signals Over Time-Varying Flat-Fading SIMO Channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928489","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Likelihood SNR Estimation of Linearly-Modulated Signals Over Time-Varying Flat-Fading SIMO Channels","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.15,  2015","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"63","issue":"2","publicationDate":"Jan.15, 2015","accessionNumber":"14818439","dateOfInsertion":"18 December 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6928489/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001804","fundingName":"Canada Research Chairs"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Likelihood SNR Estimation of Linearly-Modulated Signals Over Time-Varying Flat-Fading SIMO Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-bellili-2364017-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.133017S","chronDate":"Jan.15,  2015","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6980168","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6980168","articleId":"6928489","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"Crown","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6928490,"authors":[{"name":"Mohamad Kalil","affiliation":["Western University, London, Ontario, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7755/7140887/6928490/kalil-small.gif","p":["Mohamad Kalil received the BSc and MSc degrees in electrical\n engineering from the Jordan University of Science and Technology, Jordan, in 2009 and 2011, respectively.

However, mobile devices are provided with small batteries that can be drained quickly by high data rate transmission. Motivated by the fundamental requirement of extending the battery utilization time per charge of mobile devices, this work presents two power-efficient schedulers for mixed streaming services in LTE uplink systems. Our objective is to minimize the total transmission power for all users. The proposed schedulers are subject to rate, delay, contiguous allocation, and maximum transmission power constraints. We first consider an optimal scheduler that uses binary integer programming (BIP). Then, we propose an iterative scheduler that performs a low-complexity greedy algorithm which solves the BIP problem. We compare the performance of the proposed schedulers to the state-of-the-art schedulers such as the energy-aware resource allocation (EARA) [1] and the proportional fair (PF) [2] in terms of rate, delay, average transmission power and complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed schedulers offer a remarkable transmission power reduction as compared to the PF and the EARA schedulers, and satisfy the QoS requirements.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"QoS-Aware Power-Efficient Scheduler for LTE Uplink","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","doi":"10.1109/TMC.2014.2363839","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing","pdfPath":"/iel7/7755/7140887/06928490.pdf","startPage":"1672","endPage":"1685","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMC.2014.2363839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7140887","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928490","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928490/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug. 1 2015","displayDocTitle":"QoS-Aware Power-Efficient Scheduler for LTE Uplink","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"14","issue":"8","htmlLink":"/document/6928490/","dateOfInsertion":"01 July 2015","publicationDate":"1 Aug. 2015","accessionNumber":"15259688","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"QoS-Aware Power-Efficient Scheduler for LTE Uplink","sourcePdf":"tmc-kalil-2363839-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100853S","chronDate":"Aug. 1 2015","xplore-pub-id":"7755","isNumber":"7140887","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7755","citationCount":"38","xplore-issue":"7140887","articleId":"6928490","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6928494,"authors":[{"name":"Ba-Ngu Vo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Curtin University, Bentley, WA, Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6955884/6928494/6928494-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ba-Ngu Vo received his Bachelor degrees jointly in Science and Electrical Engineering with first class honors in 1994, and the Ph.D. degree in 1997.

Each iteration of this filter involves an update operation and a prediction operation, both of which result in weighted sums of multi-target exponentials with intractably large number of terms. To truncate these sums, the ranked assignment and K-th shortest path algorithms are used in the update and prediction, respectively, to determine the most significant terms without exhaustively computing all of the terms. In addition, using tools derived from the same framework, such as probability hypothesis density filtering, we present inexpensive (relative to the \u03b4-GLMB filter) look-ahead strategies to reduce the number of computations. Characterization of the L1-error in the multi-target density arising from the truncation is presented.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Labeled Random Finite Sets and the Bayes Multi-Target Tracking Filter","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2364014","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6955884/06928494.pdf","startPage":"6554","endPage":"6567","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2364014","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6955884","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928494","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928494/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.15,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Labeled Random Finite Sets and the Bayes Multi-Target Tracking Filter","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"62","issue":"24","htmlLink":"/document/6928494/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","publicationDate":"Dec.15, 2014","accessionNumber":"14759178","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Australian Research Council under the Future Fellowship","grantNumber":"FT0991854"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Labeled Random Finite Sets and the Bayes Multi-Target Tracking Filter","sourcePdf":"tsp-vo-2364014-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.121072S","chronDate":"Dec.15,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6955884","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"349","xplore-issue":"6955884","articleId":"6928494","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-28"},{"_id":6928495,"authors":[{"name":"Furkan Can Kavasoglu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/78/6940343/6928495/6928495-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Furkan Can Kavasoglu (S'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical and electronics engineering from Bilkent University, Turkey, in 2010 and the M.S. degree in electrical and computer engineering from University of California, San Diego, in 2012.

First, we examine two simple straightforward extensions of blind interference alignment and observe that neither of them is uniformly superior under all user distribution. Then, we exploit the location information of the users and base stations (BSs) in the cluster to define the semi-blind interference alignment problem, whose objective function is to minimize the supersymbol length by grouping the users that can be served in the same time slot. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose two heuristic centralized algorithms that can provide effective solutions. The first scheme, top-level semi-blind supersymbol design, employs a grouping indicator matrix to determine the supersymbol while the second scheme, ordered semi-blind supersymbol design, constructs the supersymbol in an ordered and greedy fashion. Finally, we propose a more decentralized scheme which does not have the location information of all users and BSs in the cluster, but the BS utilizes the long-term SINR values, obtained via feedback, of each user it serves. By numerical simulations, we show that the proposed semi-blind algorithms perform uniformly better than pure blind interference alignment schemes for any possible user distribution scenario.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6940343","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2014.2364012","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel7/78/6940343/06928495.pdf","startPage":"6335","endPage":"6348","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2014.2364012","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Blind Interference Alignment Techniques for Small Cell Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.1,  2014","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Blind Interference Alignment Techniques for Small Cell Networks","volume":"62","issue":"23","htmlLink":"/document/6928495/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec.1, 2014","accessionNumber":"14733742","dateOfInsertion":"07 November 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928495/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingName":"Ericsson endowed chair funds"},{"fundingName":"Center for Wireless Communications"},{"fundingName":"NSF","grantNumber":"CCF-1115645"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Blind Interference Alignment Techniques for Small Cell Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-kavasoglu-2364012-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.108926S","chronDate":"Dec.1,  2014","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"6940343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"6940343","articleId":"6928495","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6928496,"authors":[{"name":"Kenji Tei","affiliation":["National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo, Japan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6221021/7060775/6928496/tei-2360506-small.gif","p":["Kenji Tei received the Ph.D. degree in engineering from Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, in 2008.","He is currently an Assistant Professor with the National Institute of Informatics, Tokyo.

The Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) developed by HL7 is a core document standard to ensure such interoperability, and propagation of this document format is critical for interoperability. Unfortunately, hospitals are reluctant to adopt interoperable HIS due to its deployment cost except for in a handful countries. A problem arises even when more hospitals start using the CDA document format because the data scattered in different documents are hard to manage. In this paper, we describe our CDA document generation and integration Open API service based on cloud computing, through which hospitals are enabled to conveniently generate CDA documents without having to purchase proprietary software.

Theoretical analysis of the DA indicates that the voltage waves in the gate and drain lines can be described by a system of linear partial differential equations. The transformer coupling between the lines allows for cancellation of the reverse transmission coefficient of the system. There is an optimal value for the coupling coefficient between the lines that unilateralizes the DA. This optimal coupling coefficient is derived in terms of the gate-drain capacitance and capacitances of the gate and drain lines. Using the proposed technique, two monolithic microwave integrated circuit DAs are designed and implemented in a 0.1- \u03bcm GaAs pHEMT process. The first DA provides average gain of 10 dB and 3-dB bandwidth (BW) of 39 GHz. The amplifier exhibits the minimum noise figure (NF) of 2.3 dB and the maximum output 1-dB compression point ( P1 dB) of 14.0 dBm, while consuming 80 mW from a 2-V supply. The second amplifier, composed of two cascaded coupled-line DAs, provides average gain of 19.2 dB, 3-dB BW of 37.5 GHz, the minimum NF of 2.3 dB, and the maximum P1 dB of 12.6 dBm. It consumes 131 mW from a 2-V supply. The designed amplifiers can operate with supply voltages as low as 0.5 V to reduce power consumption, while their gain, BW, and NF are preserved. The maximum ratio of gain-bandwidth product to power consumption GBW/Pdc of 11.9 GHz/mW is provided by the cascaded DA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928503/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","volume":"62","issue":"12","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14787425","dateOfInsertion":"02 December 2014","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6928503/","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Unilateralization of MMIC Distributed Amplifiers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unilateralization of MMIC Distributed Amplifiers","sourcePdf":"tmtt-nikandish-2361341-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093598S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"22","isNumber":"6971049","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"6971049","articleId":"6928503","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6928504,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel H.

Additional circuit operation effects arise because TFETs have asymmetric source-drain conduction. The N-TFET (P-TFET) has low conduction with negative (positive) V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DS</sub>\n bias. As shown for the first time, this asymmetric conduction can be the cause of potential circuit failures and reliability risks if not properly avoided. It is revealed that relatively large voltages can be bootstrapped within digital TFET circuits. These bootstrapped voltages are dependent on the ratio of fixed capacitance to coupling capacitance times V\n<sub xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">DD</sub>\n.

Circuit checks and redesign are proposed to avoid these problems. This bootstrapping phenomenon is unique to TFETs and may have significant speed and reliability impacts. A second, and favorable, aspect of TFET's asymmetric source-drain conduction is that it enables compact implementations of MUX gates.

A critical challenge for the paradigm is to incentivize phone users to be workers providing sensing services. While some theoretical incentive mechanisms for general-purpose crowdsourcing have been proposed, it is still an open issue as to how to incorporate the theoretical framework into the practical MCS system. In this paper, we propose an incentive mechanism based on a quality-driven auction (QDA). The mechanism is specifically for the MCS system, where the worker is paid off based on the quality of sensed data instead of working time, as adopted in the literature. We theoretically prove that the mechanism is truthful, individual rational, platform profitable, and social-welfare optimal. Moreover, we incorporate our incentive mechanism into a Wi-Fi fingerprint-based indoor localization system to incentivize the MCS-based fingerprint collection. We present a probabilistic model to evaluate the reliability of the submitted data, which resolves the issue that the ground truth for the data reliability is unavailable. We realize and deploy an indoor localization system to evaluate our proposed incentive mechanism and present extensive experimental results.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel7/25/7268796/06928506.pdf","startPage":"4203","endPage":"4214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2014.2363842","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2014.2363842","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7268796","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928506","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quality-Driven Auction-Based Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sensors","Data models","Reliability","Mobile communication","Contracts","Computational modeling","Mobile handsets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["incentive schemes","indoor communication","mobile radio","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile crowd sensing","quality driven auction","incentive mechanism","incentivize phone users","sensing services","Wi-Fi fingerprint","indoor localization system","fingerprint collection","data reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Incentive","mobile crowd sensing","indoor localization"]},{"kwd":["Incentive","indoor localization","mobile crowd sensing (MCS)"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928506/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2015","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","displayDocTitle":"Quality-Driven Auction-Based Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing","volume":"64","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/6928506/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2015","accessionNumber":"15456533","dateOfInsertion":"15 September 2015","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/501100001809","fundingName":"National Natural Science Foundation of China","grantNumber":"NSFC 61202373"},{"fundingName":"Shanghai Basic Research Key Project","grantNumber":"13510711300, 12JC1405200 and 11JC1405100"},{"fundingName":"Open Foundation of State Key Laboratory of Networking and Switching Technology (Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications)","grantNumber":"SKLNST-2013-1-16"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"CNS-1320736"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quality-Driven Auction-Based Incentive Mechanism for Mobile Crowd Sensing","sourcePdf":"tvt-tian-2363842-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.098741S","chronDate":"Sept.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"7268796","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"118","xplore-issue":"7268796","articleId":"6928506","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":6928507,"authors":[{"name":"Tanbir Haque","affiliation":["Columbia University, New York, NY, USA","InterDigital Communications, Melville, NY, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/8919/7022009/6928507/6928507-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Tanbir Haque received the B.S. degree in electrical engineeringfrom the State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY, USA, in 1994, the M.S. degree in electrical engineering from Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY, USA, in 1997, and the M.S. degree in applied mathematics from Columbia University, New York, in 2010.

The QAIC relaxes the analog front-end bandwidth requirements at the cost of some added complexity compared to the modulated wideband converter (MWC) for an overall improvement in sensitivity and energy consumption. An approach for detailed frequency domain analysis of the proposed system with linear impairments is developed. A process for selecting QAIC parameter values is illustrated through examples. The benefits of the QAIC are highlighted with cognitive radio use cases where a wide range of spectrum is observed at various resolution bandwidth settings. We demonstrate that the energy consumption of the QAIC is potentially two orders of magnitude lower than the swept-tuned spectrum analyzer (STSA) and an order of magnitude lower than the MWC. We also demonstrate that the QAIC significantly improves upon the sensitivity performance delivered by the MWC.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2360756","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/7022009/06928507.pdf","startPage":"527","endPage":"535","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=7022009","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2360756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theory and Design of a Quadrature Analog-to-Information Converter for Energy-Efficient Wideband Spectrum Sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928507","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2015","displayDocTitle":"Theory and Design of a Quadrature Analog-to-Information Converter for Energy-Efficient Wideband Spectrum Sensing","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928507/","publicationDate":"Feb. 2015","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"14883400","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928507/","volume":"62","issue":"2","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"National Science Foundation","grantNumber":"NSF ECCS 1002064"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theory and Design of a Quadrature Analog-to-Information Converter for Energy-Efficient Wideband Spectrum Sensing","sourcePdf":"tcsi-haque-2360756-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09754S","chronDate":"Feb.  2015","xplore-pub-id":"8919","isNumber":"7022009","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"55","xplore-issue":"7022009","articleId":"6928507","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2015","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6928508,"authors":[{"name":"Yuanming Suo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Johns Hopkins University"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/6949172/6928508/6928508-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Yuanming Suo (S'13) received the B.S. degree in electronic information science and technology from Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong, China, and the M.S.E. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Huntsville, AL, USA.","Currently, he is working toward the Ph.D. degree in the Digital Signal Processing Lab at The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA, where his research focuses on developing algorithms for dictionary learning and low rank representation for high-dimensional data.

In order to efficiently transmit neural signals through wireless channels, these devices require compression methods that reduce power consumption. Although recent Compressed Sensing (CS) approaches have successfully demonstrated their power, their full potential is yet to be explored. Built upon our previous on-chip CS implementation, we propose an energy efficient multi-mode CS framework that focuses on improving the off-chip components, including (i) a two-stage sensing strategy, (ii) a sparsifying dictionary directly using data, (iii) enhanced compression performance from Full Signal CS mode and Spike Restoration mode to Spike CS + Restoration mode and; (iv) extension of our framework to the Tetrode CS recovery using joint sparsity. This new framework achieves energy efficiency, implementation simplicity and system flexibility simultaneously. Extensive experiments are performed on simulation and real datasets. For our Spike CS + Restoration mode, we achieve a compression ratio of 6% with a reconstruction SNDR > 10 dB and a classification accuracy > 95% for synthetic datasets. For real datasets, we get a 10% compression ratio with ~ 10 dB for Spike CS + Restoration mode.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multi-Mode Compressed Sensing System for Implantable Neural Recordings","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2014.2359180","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/4156126/6949172/06928508.pdf","startPage":"0","endPage":"0","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2014.2359180","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6949172","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928508","chorusPdfPath":"/ielaam/4156126/6949172/6928508-aam.pdf","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928508/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multi-Mode Compressed Sensing System for Implantable Neural Recordings","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"8","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/6928508/","dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","publicationDate":"Oct. 2014","accessionNumber":"14735206","pubMedId":"25343768","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"fundingAgencies":{"fundingAgency":[{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000001","fundingName":"U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF)","grantNumber":"1057644, CCF-1117545 and DMS-1222567"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000183","fundingName":"Army Research Office","grantNumber":"60219-MA"},{"fundingId":"10.13039/100000006","fundingName":"Office of Naval Research","grantNumber":"N00014-12-1-0765 and N00014-10-1-0223"}]},"openAccessFlag":"F","chorusFlag":"true","title":"Energy-Efficient Multi-Mode Compressed Sensing System for Implantable Neural Recordings","sourcePdf":"tbcas-suo-2359180-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.139817S","chronDate":"Oct.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"6949172","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"6949172","articleId":"6928508","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-16"},{"_id":6928509,"authors":[{"name":"Navid Lashkarian","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA"],"firstName":"Navid","lastName":"Lashkarian","id":"37372875700"},{"name":"Jun Shi","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37085429096"},{"name":"Marcellus Forbes","affiliation":["Broadcom Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA"],"firstName":"Marcellus","lastName":"Forbes","id":"38133275300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1549-8328"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0806"}],"articleNumber":"6928509","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":892},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Circuits and Systems Society","url":"http://www.ieee-cas.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Vectors","Predistortion","Calculus","Optimization","Kernel","Nonlinear distortion","Baseband"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive filters","differentiation","distortion","electronic engineering computing","Hessian matrices","learning (artificial intelligence)","least squares approximations","linearisation techniques","radiofrequency power amplifiers","vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["radio frequency power amplifiers","nonlinearity","memory effects","complex-domain adaptive filtering","predistortion kernel learning","power-amplifier linearization","least-squares error function","optimal predistortion function","complex-valued arguments","Cauchy-Riemann differentiability condition","nonholomorphic functions","Wirtinger calculus","differential operators","digital predistortion coefficient optimization","real vector space","Hessian forms","descent-update algorithms","Gauss-Newton","quasi-equivalent variants"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Direct learning","linearization","power amplifier","predistortion","Wirtinger calculus"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928509","abstract":"Performance of radio frequency power amplifiers is often significantly degraded by nonlinearity and memory effects. We study the applicability of complex-domain adaptive filtering to the problem of predistortion kernel learning for power-amplifier linearization. The least-squares error function that arises while deriving the optimal predistortion function is often real with complex-valued arguments, therefore, nonanalytic in the Cauchy-Riemann sense. To avoid the strict Cauchy-Riemann differentiability condition for non-holomorphic functions (e.g. mean-square error), we resort to the theory of Wirtinger calculus, which allows construction of differential operators in a way that is analogous to functions of real variables. By deploying the new differential operators, digital pre-distortion coefficient optimization is carried out in a space isomorphic to the real vector space, at a computational complexity that is significantly lower than that of the real space. We also derive proper Hessian forms for minimization of the objective function and propose a variety of descent-update algorithms, namely Newton, Gauss-Newton, and their quasi-equivalent variants for this problem. Performance assessments and experimental validation of the proposed methodologies are also addressed.","doi":"10.1109/TCSI.2014.2337252","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCSI.2014.2337252","startPage":"3496","endPage":"3505","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","pdfPath":"/iel7/8919/6964837/06928509.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6964837","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Direct Learning Adaptive Scheme for Power-Amplifier Linearization Based on Wirtinger Calculus","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"A Direct Learning Adaptive Scheme for Power-Amplifier Linearization Based on Wirtinger Calculus","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"21 November 2014","volume":"61","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928509/","accessionNumber":"14760370","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928509/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Direct Learning Adaptive Scheme for Power-Amplifier Linearization Based on Wirtinger Calculus","sourcePdf":"tcsi-lashkarian-2337252-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.036751S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","isNumber":"6964837","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8919","citationCount":"6","articleId":"6928509","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-23"},{"_id":6928512,"authors":[{"name":"Ratheesh K.

We demonstrate the potential use of such a system in a non-Boolean computing paradigm and demonstrate pattern recognition, as one possible application using such a system.","doi":"10.1109/JETCAS.2014.2361069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel7/5503868/6970761/06928513.pdf","startPage":"450","endPage":"459","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JETCAS.2014.2361069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6970761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting Synchronization Properties of Correlated Electron Devices in a Non-Boolean Computing Fabric for Template Matching","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928513/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting Synchronization Properties of Correlated Electron Devices in a Non-Boolean Computing Fabric for Template Matching","volume":"4","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","accessionNumber":"14810753","htmlLink":"/document/6928513/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"23 May 2017","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting Synchronization Properties of Correlated Electron Devices in a Non-Boolean Computing Fabric for Template Matching","sourcePdf":"jetcas-parihar-2361069-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10014S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"5503868","isNumber":"6970761","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5503868","citationCount":"24","xplore-issue":"6970761","articleId":"6928513","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6928515,"authors":[{"name":"Efstathios Katranaras","affiliation":["Institute for Communication Systems (ICS), University of Surrey, Guildford, U.K."],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6979302/6928515/katra-2363672-small.gif","p":["\nEfstathios Katranaras (M'06) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and\ncomputer engineering from National Technical University of Athens, Athens, Greece, in 2005 and the M.Sc.

We consider clustered cooperation and investigate effective techniques for managing inter-cluster interference to improve users' performance in terms of both spectral and energy efficiency. We use information theoretic analysis to establish general closed form expressions for the system achievable sum rate and the users' Bit-per-Joule capacity while adopting a realistic user device power consumption model. Two main inter-cluster interference management approaches are identified and studied, i.e., through: 1) spectrum re-use; and 2) users' power control. For the former case, we show that isolating clusters by orthogonal resource allocation is the best strategy. For the latter case, we introduce a mathematically tractable user power control scheme and observe that a green opportunistic transmission strategy can significantly reduce the adverse effects of inter-cluster interference while exploiting the benefits from cooperation. To compare the different approaches in the context of real-world systems and evaluate the effect of key design parameters on the users' energy-spectral efficiency relationship, we fit the analytical expressions into a practical macrocell scenario. Our results demonstrate that significant improvement in terms of both energy and spectral efficiency can be achieved by energy-aware interference management.","doi":"10.1109/TWC.2014.2363672","startPage":"6580","endPage":"6592","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TWC.2014.2363672","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6979302","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications","pdfPath":"/iel7/7693/6979302/06928515.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Green Inter-Cluster Interference Management in Uplink of Multi-Cell Processing Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928515/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Green Inter-Cluster Interference Management in Uplink of Multi-Cell Processing Systems","volume":"13","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/6928515/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14824377","publicationDate":"Dec. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"08 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2014","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"17 October 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Green Inter-Cluster Interference Management in Uplink of Multi-Cell Processing Systems","sourcePdf":"twc-katranaras-2363672-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.09868S","chronDate":"Dec.  2014","xplore-pub-id":"7693","isNumber":"6979302","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7693","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6979302","articleId":"6928515","onlineDate":"17 October 2014","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":6928519,"authors":[{"name":"Zhe Wang","affiliation":["School of Electrical Engineering and Telecommunications, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7693/6979302/6928519/wang-2363676-small.gif","p":["\nZhe Wang (S'10\u2013M'14) received the M.Eng.Sc. degree in\ntelecommunications engineering and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from The University of New South Wales,\nSydney, N.S.W., Australia, in 2010 and 2014, respectively.

Both primary and secondary transmitters are Poisson distributed nodes with limited feedback of channel quality information from their local receivers. The primary transmitters are active if their local primary channels are above a certain threshold. In the opportunistic spectrum sharing scheme without primary exclusive region, the secondary transmitters are elected to transmit if their local channels are above the required threshold. In the opportunistic spectrum sharing scheme with a primary exclusive region, the secondary transmitters transmit if their local channels are above the threshold and they are outside the exclusive regions of the active primary receivers. For both schemes, the optimal secondary node density is analytically derived by maximizing the secondary area spectral efficiency subject to the secondary outage constraint and the primary efficiency loss constraint. Numerical results show that, for a tight secondary outage constraint, it is more beneficial to use the scheme with no primary exclusive region. For relatively loose secondary outage constraint, the scheme with primary exclusive regions is recommended.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast

The feedback loop from customers is slow and often there is a lack of mechanisms that allow for efficient customer data collection and analysis. As a result, there is the risk that requirements prioritization becomes opinion-based rather than data-driven, and that R&D investments are made without an accurate way of continuously validating whether they correspond to customer needs. We call this phenomenon the 'open loop' problem, referring to the challenges for product management to get accurate and timely feedback from customers. To address this problem, we develop the HYPEX model (Hypothesis Experiment Data-Driven Development) that supports companies in running feature experiments to shorten customer feedback loops. We evaluate the model in three software development companies and observe how feature experiments increase the opportunity for data-driven software development.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928783/","chronOrPublicationDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6928783/","dateOfInsertion":"20 November 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14768882","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"From Opinions to Data-Driven Software R&D: A Multi-case Study on How to Close the 'Open Loop' Problem","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"From Opinions to Data-Driven Software R&D: A Multi-case Study on How to Close the 'Open Loop' Problem","confLoc":"Verona, Italy","sourcePdf":"5795a009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072691S","chronDate":"27-29 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6921520","isNumber":"6928770","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6921520","citationCount":"41","xplore-issue":"6928770","articleId":"6928783","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6928910,"authors":[{"name":"Chune Li","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Chune","lastName":"Li","id":"37085498719"},{"name":"Richong Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Richong","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38468452400"},{"name":"Jinpeng Huai","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jinpeng","lastName":"Huai","id":"37284361400"},{"name":"Hailong Sun","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering Beihang University, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Hailong","lastName":"Sun","id":"37277693100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5054-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5053-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6928910","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":44,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":692},"abstract":"Mashing up Web services and RESTful APIs is a novel programming approach to develop new applications. As the number of available resources is increasing rapidly, to discover potential services or APIs is getting difficult. Therefore, it is vital to relieve mashup developers of the burden of service discovery. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model to assist mashup creators by recommending a list of APIs that may be used to compose a required mashup given descriptions of the mashup. Specifically, a relational topic model is exploited to characterize the relationship among mashups, APIs and their links. In addition, we incorporate the popularity of APIs to the model and make predictions on the links between mashups and APIs. Moreover, the statistical analysis on a public mashup platform shows the current status of mashup development and the applicability of this study. Experiments on a large service data set confirm the effectiveness of this proposed approach.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923037/6928859/06928910.pdf","startPage":"289","endPage":"296","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2014.50","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2014.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928859","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928910","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach for API Recommendation in Mashup Development","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mashups","Vectors","Mathematical model","Data models","Probabilistic logic","Google"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["application program interfaces","probability","recommender systems","statistical analysis","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Web services","RESTful API","programming approach","service discovery","probabilistic model","API list recommendation","relational topic model","mashup relationship characterization","statistical analysis","public mashup platform","mashup development","large service data set"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["mashup development","API recommendation","relational topic model"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928910/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach for API Recommendation in Mashup Development","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928910/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14789385","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach for API Recommendation in Mashup Development","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5054a289.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.110201S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923037","isNumber":"6928859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923037","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"6928859","articleId":"6928910","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-04"},{"_id":6928911,"authors":[{"name":"Pinjia He","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Pinjia","lastName":"He","id":"37085442678"},{"name":"Jieming Zhu","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jieming","lastName":"Zhu","id":"38244334400"},{"name":"Zibin Zheng","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering Department, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China","State Key Lab for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing University, China"],"firstName":"Zibin","lastName":"Zheng","id":"37538781600"},{"name":"Jianlong Xu","affiliation":["Shenzhen Research Institute, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Jianlong","lastName":"Xu","id":"37085445745"},{"name":"Michael R.

To recommend Web services that best fit a user's need, QoS values which characterize the non-functional properties of those candidate services are in demand. But in reality, the QoS information of Web service is not easy to obtain, because only limited historical invocation records exist. To tackle this challenge, in recent literature, a number of QoS prediction methods are proposed, but they still demonstrate disadvantages on prediction accuracy. In this paper, we design a location-based hierarchical matrix factorization (HMF) method to perform personalized QoS prediction, whereby effective service recommendation can be made. We cluster users and services into several user-service groups based on their location information, each of which contains a small set of users and services. To better characterize the QoS data, our HMF model is trained in a hierarchical way by using the global QoS matrix as well as several location-based local QoS matrices generated from user-service clusters. Then the missing QoS values can be predicted by compactly combining the results from local matrix factorization and global matrix factorization. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on a real-world Web service QoS dataset with 1,974,675 real Web service invocation records. The experimental results show that our HMF method achieves higher prediction accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928911/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","accessionNumber":"14789409","htmlLink":"/document/6928911/","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","displayDocTitle":"Location-Based Hierarchical Matrix Factorization for Web Service Recommendation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Location-Based Hierarchical Matrix Factorization for Web Service Recommendation","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5054a297.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.098495S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923037","isNumber":"6928859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923037","citationCount":"51","xplore-issue":"6928859","articleId":"6928911","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6928916,"authors":[{"name":"Min Yao","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Min","lastName":"Yao","id":"38246096600"},{"name":"Peng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an"],"firstName":"Peng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085367285"},{"name":"Yin Li","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Yin","lastName":"Li","id":"37879809900"},{"name":"Jie Hu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Hu","id":"37085368014"},{"name":"Chuang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, Beijing"],"firstName":"Chuang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37085349551"},{"name":"Xiang Yang Li","affiliation":["Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, US"],"firstName":"Xiang Yang","lastName":"Li","id":"37085343295"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5054-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5053-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6928916","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":13,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":264},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Cloud computing","Optimization","Pricing","Heuristic algorithms","Scheduling algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["batch processing (computers)","cloud computing","cost reduction","pricing","scheduling","Web services"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing cost reduction","cloud brokerage service","Web service providers","deadline-constrained batch jobs","job scheduling","pricing options","instance renting strategy","approximation algorithms"]}],"abstract":"Many web service providers use commercial cloud computing infrastructures like Amazon for flexible and reliable service deployment. For these web service providers, the cost of cloud computing usage becomes a big part of their IT department cost. Facing the diverse pricing models including on-demand, reserved, and spot instance, it is difficult for web service providers to optimize their cost. This paper introduces a new cloud brokerage service to help web service providers to minimize their cloud computing cost for deadline-constrained batch jobs, which have been a significant workload in web services. Our cloud brokerage service associates each batch job with deadline, and always tries to use cheaper reserved instances for computation to maintain a minimum cost. We achieve this with the following two steps: (1) given a set of jobs' specifications, determine the scheduling of jobs, (2) given the scheduling and pricing options, find an optimal instance renting strategy. We prove that both problems in two steps are computation intractable, and propose approximation algorithms for them. Trace-based evaluation shows that our cloud brokerage service can reduce up to 57% of the cloud computing cost.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2014.56","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923037/6928859/06928916.pdf","startPage":"337","endPage":"344","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2014.56","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928859","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cutting Your Cloud Computing Cost for Deadline-Constrained Batch Jobs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928916","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928916/","displayDocTitle":"Cutting Your Cloud Computing Cost for Deadline-Constrained Batch Jobs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14789362","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928916/","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cutting Your Cloud Computing Cost for Deadline-Constrained Batch Jobs","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5054a337.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061088S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923037","isNumber":"6928859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923037","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"6928859","articleId":"6928916","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-08"},{"_id":6928932,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Since web services are defined by XML- based standards to overcome platform dependency, they are very eligible to integrate with each other in order to establish new services. This composition enables us to reuse existing services, which results in less cost and time consumption. One of the recent problems with web service composition is to maximize the overall Quality of Service (QoS) of the composed service. Most common elements of QoS are response time, availability, reliability, throughput and cost (price). Since the selection of the optimal execution plan that maximizes the composition's overall QoS is a NP hard problem, applying optimization techniques is very popular. In this work, we propose an improved Genetic Algorithm based approach to optimize the overall QoS of the composed service. Experimental results indicate improvement for QoS of the composition built by the proposed methods.","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2014.72","startPage":"463","endPage":"470","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2014.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928859","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923037/6928859/06928932.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved Genetic Algorithm Based Approach for QoS Aware Web Service Composition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928932/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Improved Genetic Algorithm Based Approach for QoS Aware Web Service Composition","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6928932/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"14789425","publicationDate":"June 2014","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved Genetic Algorithm Based Approach for QoS Aware Web Service Composition","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5054a463.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056303S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923037","isNumber":"6928859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923037","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"6928859","articleId":"6928932","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-13"},{"_id":6928956,"authors":[{"name":"K\u00e9vin Huguenin","affiliation":["EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"K\u00e9vin","lastName":"Huguenin","id":"37546234500"},{"name":"Erwan Le Merrer","affiliation":["Technicolor, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Erwan Le","lastName":"Merrer","id":"37888278100"},{"name":"Nicolas Le Scouarnec","affiliation":["Technicolor, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Nicolas Le","lastName":"Scouarnec","id":"37888279200"},{"name":"Gilles Straub","affiliation":["Technicolor, Rennes, France"],"firstName":"Gilles","lastName":"Straub","id":"37680512300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4799-5054-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4799-5053-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6928956","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":100},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Web services","Logic gates","Mobile handsets","IEEE 802.11 Standards","Browsers","HTML","Mobile communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["internetworking","transport protocols","wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Hoop system","HTTP offloading","hypertext transfer protocol","residential gateways","mobile users","3G connectivity","Wi-Fi data offloading","Wireless Fidelity","constrained mobility","broadband connection","Wi-Fi access point LAN","local area networks","Wi-Fi access points","community network"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wi-Fi offloading","asynchronous web upload","delay-tolerant networking"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6928956","doi":"10.1109/ICWS.2014.96","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWS.2014.96","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928859","publicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 IEEE International Conference on Web Services","pdfPath":"/iel7/6923037/6928859/06928956.pdf","startPage":"654","endPage":"661","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hoop: Offloading HTTP(S) POSTs from User Devices onto Residential Gateways","abstract":"Mobile users generate ever-increasing amounts of digital data, such as photos, which they upload, while on the go, to online services. 3G connectivity enables mobile users to upload their data while on the go but drains the battery of their devices and overloads mobile service providers. Wi-Fi data offloading overcomes the aforementioned issues for delay-tolerant data, at the cost of constrained mobility for users as they are required to stay within a given area while the data is uploaded. The up-link of the broadband connection of the access point is a bottleneck and incurs significant waiting times. In this paper, we advocate the exploitation of the storage capabilities of common devices located on the Wi-Fi access point LAN, typically residential gateways, to decrease the waiting time. We propose Hoop, a system for offloading upload tasks onto such devices. Hoop operates seamlessly on HTTP(S) POSTs, making it highly generic, it also requires limited changes on the gateways and on the web server and none to existing protocols or browsers. Hoop is secure and, in a typical setting, reduces the waiting time by up to a factor of 46. By correlating mobility traces with the positions of the Wi-Fi access points of a major community network, we show that Hoop drastically decreases the delay between the time a photo is taken and the time it is uploaded, compared to regular Wi-Fi offloading.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Geoscience"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6928956/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"27 June-2 July 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6928956/","dateOfInsertion":"04 December 2014","publicationDate":"June 2014","accessionNumber":"14789426","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Hoop: Offloading HTTP(S) POSTs from User Devices onto Residential Gateways","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Hoop: Offloading HTTP(S) POSTs from User Devices onto Residential Gateways","confLoc":"Anchorage, AK, USA","sourcePdf":"5054a654.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04809S","chronDate":"June 27 2014-July 2 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6923037","isNumber":"6928859","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6923037","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6928859","articleId":"6928956","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-03"},{"_id":6929003,"authors":[{"name":"Feng Zhang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37406187700"},{"name":"Ran Tao","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ran","lastName":"Tao","id":"37085377790"},{"name":"Yue Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yue","lastName":"Wang","id":"37293647600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929003","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":138},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chirp","Signal resolution","Fourier transforms","Time-frequency analysis","Sonar navigation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Fourier transforms","signal resolution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["angle resolution","fractional Fourier transform","nonstationary signals","signal processing","chirp signals"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Fractional Fourier transform","chirp signals","resolution"]}],"abstract":"The fractional Fourier transform has been proved to be one of the most competent tools for processing nonstationary signals, and thus become a very active area in signal processing community in recent years.

Compared with traditional FEM based on perfectly matched layer (PML), the hybrid technique presented here is highly efficient in terms of computational memory, time, and versatility.","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929169","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929169.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929169","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of FEM-BIE for scattering from dielectric objects buried under a rough surface","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929169","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929169/","displayDocTitle":"Application of FEM-BIE for scattering from dielectric objects buried under a rough surface","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693614","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6929169/","conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of FEM-BIE for scattering from dielectric objects buried under a rough surface","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper1502.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043569S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929169","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6929184,"authors":[{"name":"Anwesha Mukherjee","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, West Bengal University of Technology, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Anwesha","lastName":"Mukherjee","id":"37897515700"},{"name":"Debashis De","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, West Bengal University of Technology, Kolkata, India"],"firstName":"Debashis","lastName":"De","id":"38234278300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929184","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Macrocell networks","Databases","Delays","Mobile computing","Ultrafast electronics","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","femtocellular radio","mobile computing","tracking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high-speed location tracking scheme","overlay macrocell-femtocell network","mobile cloud computing","macrocell base station"]}],"abstract":"In this paper mobile cloud computing based an innovative location tracking strategy is proposed for overlay macrocell-femtocell based network.

In this paper, an improved quantum genetic algorithm (IQGA) is proposed to deal with the optimization problem of the RA. The algorithm codes the chromosome with probability amplitudes represented by sine and cosine functions, and uses an adaptive strategy of the rotation angle to update the population. Then the mutation operation is considered in this improved quantum genetic algorithm. By using the IQGA combined with hybrid full-wave/network analysis approach, the fast optimization design for the reconfigurable antenna is realized.

It is rather more suitable for implementation than the existing scheme derived from the Minimum Euclidean distance criterion, since it has the equal performance with the existing method proved by the simulation results, but much lower computational complexity.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A mapping algorithm of superposed signals in two-way relaying system","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929213","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929213.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929213","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929213","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929213/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"A mapping algorithm of superposed signals in two-way relaying system","conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6929213/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693294","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A mapping algorithm of superposed signals in two-way relaying system","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper2115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06708S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929213","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6929234,"authors":[{"name":"Rong Li","affiliation":["The State Radio Monitoring Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Rong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085503565"},{"name":"Ji Li","affiliation":["The State Radio_monitoring_center Testing Center, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ji","lastName":"Li","id":"38569383100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929234","dbTime":"28 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":98},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Relays","Cognitive radio","Delays","Receivers","Closed-form solutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","cooperative communication","diversity reception","quality of service","relay networks (telecommunication)","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective capacity analysis","underlay cooperative cognitive radio network","statistical delay quality of service constraints","cooperative transmission","direct link","relay link","secondary user","secondary receiver","diversity gain","transmission reliability"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effective capacity analysis in underlay cooperative cognitive radio network","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929234","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929234.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929234","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929234","abstract":"Based on statistical delay quality of service (QoS) constraints, effective capacity in underlay cooperative cognitive radio network is investigated.

However, mismatches of radio frequency (RF) transmitter and receiver might affect channel reciprocity, thus make antenna calibration become a crucial issue. Intra-cell antenna calibration has already been studied for single cell systems. In this paper, an inter-cell antenna calibration method is proposed for TDD CoMP systems to efficiently compensate these mismatches. Differences between the inter-cell phase information feedback from users and that calculated based on uplink channel are used to get the mismatch coefficients.

Using the derived PDF, an objective function is designed and the maximum likelihood criterion is used to optimize the beamforming weight vector of the relay network. Because the objective function does not have a concave-convex structure, gradient descending technique is applied to find the solution of the optimization problem.

In general, the classical OFDM detection algorithms are neither effective to mitigate the ICI due to the high error floor in BER curves, nor applicable to the practice due to the high computational complexity encountered in the large-sized matrix inversion. To resolve this problem, an iterative symbol detection scheme, combined with linear preprocessing at the receiver to restrict ICI support and band approximation of the channel matrix is proposed.

Following the tendency that the operating frequencies in modern satellite communication systems have migrated to Ka-band and above, it is very important to model the radiowave propagation phenomena. The dynamics of rain attenuation as well as the generation of rain attenuation time series of rain attenuation are required for the prediction of the satellite communication systems' performance. Here we present the mathematical framework for the description of correlated rain attenuations induced on multiple links with SDEs. Moreover, an expression for the channel estimation that can be used for the evaluation of Fade Mitigation Techniques (FMTs) is also presented. In the numerical results Section, two satellite systems employing spatial diversity (site and orbital) are examined and the new channel estimation expression is investigated.","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929277","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929277.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929277","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Application of stochastic differential equations for the performance evaluation of broadband satellite communication systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929277","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Application of stochastic differential equations for the performance evaluation of broadband satellite communication systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929277/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693594","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6929277/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Application of stochastic differential equations for the performance evaluation of broadband satellite communication systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper2475.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052127S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929277","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6929281,"authors":[{"name":"Xi-Yu Wang","affiliation":["Wireless R&D Center, ZTE Corporation Ltd, Pudong District, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xi-Yu","lastName":"Wang","id":"37085555701"},{"name":"Bin Li","affiliation":["Wireless R&D Center, ZTE Corporation Ltd, Pudong District, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Li","id":"37085564313"},{"name":"Xi Yuan","affiliation":["Wireless R&D Center, ZTE Corporation Ltd, Pudong District, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Xi","lastName":"Yuan","id":"37085534051"},{"name":"Jian-Wu Dou","affiliation":["Wireless R&D Center, ZTE Corporation Ltd, Pudong District, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Wu","lastName":"Dou","id":"37085544670"},{"name":"Yong Li","affiliation":["Wireless R&D Center, ZTE Corporation Ltd, Pudong District, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Li","id":"37085556046"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929281","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":149},"abstract":"By adopting elevation domain beamforming and spatial domain multiplexing, 3 Dimensional (3D) Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) antenna system is the key technology in providing high throughput in modern communication systems. However, the conventional channel modeling method mainly focuses on 2 dimensional (2D) MIMO channels which neglect the vertical plane. It inspires scholars to do research on the characteristics of 3D channel models' elevation parameters. In this paper, we propose an automatic measurement approach for 3D MIMO channel by using ray-tracing algorithm. This method delivers the characteristics of the elevation angle for low-rise floors in Outdoor to Indoor (O2I) scenario, which have accurately matched the classical experimental results. In addition, further investigation for high-rise floors is successfully made by this proposed methodology as well.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929281.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929281","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929281","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Elevation angle research in three-dimension channel model using ray-tracing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Floors","Three-dimensional displays","MIMO","Channel models","Solid modeling","Antenna measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna arrays","array signal processing","MIMO communication","multiplexing","ray tracing","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["elevation angle research","3D channel model elevation domain beamforming","spatial domain multiplexing","3D multiple-input multiple-output antenna system","MIMO antenna system","communication systems","channel modeling method","2D MIMO channels","3D channel model elevation parameters","automatic measurement approach","3D MIMO channel","ray-tracing algorithm","outdoor-to-indoor scenario","O2I scenario"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929281/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Elevation angle research in three-dimension channel model using ray-tracing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6929281/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693224","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Elevation angle research in three-dimension channel model using ray-tracing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper1929.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096803S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929281","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":6929282,"authors":[{"name":"Qingtao Wan","affiliation":["National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"firstName":"Qingtao","lastName":"Wan","id":"37894049600"},{"name":"Guanyi Ma","affiliation":["National Astronomical Observatories Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chaoyang-qu, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Guanyi","lastName":"Ma","id":"37892890100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929282","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":150},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Signal to noise ratio","Relay networks (telecommunications)","OFDM","Joints","Simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["amplify and forward communication","frequency division multiple access","OFDM modulation","relay networks (telecommunication)","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["resource allocation","AF-OFDMA two-way relay systems","amplify-and-forward based multirelay two-way relay systems","amplify-and-forward based multiuser two-way relay systems","orthogonal frequency division multiple access modulation","relay selection","power allocation algorithm","relay node","water-filling method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Two-way relay","amplify-and-forward","OFDMA","equivalent channel power gain","water-filling method"]}],"abstract":"A resource allocation problem is considered \n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n in amplify-and-forward (AF) based multirelay and multiuser two-way relay systems under orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) modulation.

An equivalent channel power gain is proposed to simplify the system model. The relay node and users, which has the maximal value of equivalent channel power gains, are used to transmit signals for every subchannel. The water-filling method is used to power allocation among subchannels.

However, it has the difficulty to support high-order modulations like 256QAM and suffers from performance loss especially under severely fading channels. To solve this problem, a channel estimation method for OFDM system is proposed under the framework of compressive sensing (CS) in this paper. Firstly, by exploiting the signal structure, the auxiliary channel information is obtained. Secondly, we propose the auxiliary information based compressive sampling matching pursuit (A-CoSaMP) algorithm to utilize a very few frequency-domain pilots embedded in the OFDM block for the exact channel impulse response estimation. Simulation results demonstrate that the CS-based OFDM outperforms the conventional dual pseudo noise padded OFDM and CS-based TDS-OFDM schemes in both static and mobile environments.","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929341","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929341.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929341","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint time-frequency channel estimation method for OFDM systems based on compressive sensing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929341","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929341/","displayDocTitle":"Joint time-frequency channel estimation method for OFDM systems based on compressive sensing","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693867","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6929341/","conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint time-frequency channel estimation method for OFDM systems based on compressive sensing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper1416.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.066732S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929341","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6929342,"authors":[{"name":"Yu Zhang","affiliation":["China National Radio, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yu","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37085423583"},{"name":"Wei Tang","affiliation":["China National Radio, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Tang","id":"37085412639"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929342","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":400},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Predistortion","Nonlinear distortion","Filtering","Joints","Vectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distortion","OFDM modulation","power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM PAPR reduction","digital amplitude predistortion","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing systems","peak to average power ratio","signal distortion","transmitter","nonlinear components","high power amplifiers","input back-off","nonlinear distortion","PAPR reduction methods","active constellation extension","memoryless solid state power amplifier","SSPA","Rapp model","computer simulations","computer analysis","PAPR reduction techniques"]}],"abstract":"The major drawback of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems is the high peak to average power ratio (PAPR), which results in signal distortion when the transmitter has nonlinear components. Even though the predistortion is used to compensate for the high power amplifiers (HPA), some amount of input back-off (IBO) is required to remove nonlinear distortion completely since the PAPR is very high. In this paper, we propose the PAPR reduction methods of clipping and ACE (active constellation extension) to compensate for the nonlinear distortion. Then, the amount of required IBO is lowered so that power efficiency is improved than the only predistortion case. Based on the memoryless solid state power amplifier (SSPA) of Rapp model, computer simulations and analysis in this paper demonstrates that, especially when the HPA is working near or in the saturation region, a predistorter will cease to be in effect.

It also provides a systematic way to derive distributed and fast-convergent algorithms and to evaluate the fairness of resource allocation. This approach can even solve several previously open problems in the wireless networking literature, e.g., Kandukuri and Boyd (TWC 2002), Wiesel, Eldar and Shamai (TSP 2006), Krishnan and Luss (WCNC 2011).

The accuracy, supported by a precise description of the environment, is achieved at a very high computational complexity. This computational complexity scales directly with the number of propagation paths, of which the diffuse scattering paths comprise a large proportion. In this paper, we propose a general subdivision algorithm for diffuse scattering of RT in indoor scenarios based on concentric circles. The proper tile size is defined according to the system bandwidth. The method significantly reduces the computational complexity of RT with no loss in accuracy. The method is verified by evaluating the power delay profile (PDP), delay spread and angular spread.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929365.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929365","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929365","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929365","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An effective subdivision algorithm for diffuse scattering of ray tracing","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scattering","Delays","Computational complexity","Accuracy","Ray tracing","Bandwidth","Rough surfaces"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","electromagnetic wave diffraction","electromagnetic wave propagation","electromagnetic wave scattering","ray tracing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["effective subdivision algorithm","diffuse scattering","ray tracing","electromagnetic wave propagation","specular reflection","dielectric blocks","diffraction","computational complexity","propagation paths","indoor scenarios","concentric circles","power delay profile","PDP","delay spread","angular spread"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929365/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"An effective subdivision algorithm for diffuse scattering of ray tracing","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6929365/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693900","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An effective subdivision algorithm for diffuse scattering of ray tracing","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper2548.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073213S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929365","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6929368,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-ichi Naganawa","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun-ichi","lastName":"Naganawa","id":"38542599700"},{"name":"Minseok Kim","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Minseok","lastName":"Kim","id":"37278674100"},{"name":"Takahiro Aoyagi","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takahiro","lastName":"Aoyagi","id":"37432820400"},{"name":"Jun-ichi Takada","affiliation":["Graduate School of Science and Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Jun-ichi","lastName":"Takada","id":"37269840500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929368","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":163},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological system modeling","Wave functions","Antenna radiation patterns","Finite difference methods","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antennas","body area networks","finite difference time-domain analysis","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["FDTD-based antenna de-embedding","WBAN on-body channel modeling","wireless body area network systems","WBAN systems","channel modeling","human body hinders","antenna de-embedding scheme","spherical wave functions"]}],"abstract":"For designing reliable and low-power wireless body area network (WBAN) systems, channel modeling plays an important role.

A preliminary validation is also presented.","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929368","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929368.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929368","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FDTD-based antenna de-embedding in WBAN on-body channel modeling","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929368","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929368/","displayDocTitle":"FDTD-based antenna de-embedding in WBAN on-body channel modeling","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693609","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6929368/","conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FDTD-based antenna de-embedding in WBAN on-body channel modeling","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper2472.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.046765S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6929378,"authors":[{"name":"Hongyan Wang","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Dalian University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Hongyan","lastName":"Wang","id":"38025512400"},{"name":"Bingnan Pei","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Dalian University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Bingnan","lastName":"Pei","id":"37085440543"},{"name":"Yunfeng Bai","affiliation":["College of Information Engineering, Dalian University, Dalian, China"],"firstName":"Yunfeng","lastName":"Bai","id":"37085439350"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929378","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":107},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MIMO radar","Optimization","Parameter estimation","Clutter","Robustness","Iterative methods","Uncertainty"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["covariance matrices","iterative methods","mathematical programming","MIMO radar","parameter estimation","radar clutter"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robust waveform design","MIMO radar","worst-case estimation performance","multiinput multioutput radar","parameter estimation","clutter","iterative algorithm","waveform covariance matrix","WCM","semidefinite programming","SDP problem"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, the robust waveform optimization for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) radar is investigated to improve the worst-case performance of parameter estimation in the presence of clutter.

The proposed VGA is composed of two cascading variable gain cells. Each gain cell employs a simple single-stage pseudo-exponential topology to realize continuous decibel in linear gain control and low power consumption. Two cascading cells realize a VGA with more than 50dB decibel in linear gain tuning range and 1.2-GHz-3dB bandwidth. The proposed wideband VGA consumes about 1.2mA current from a single 1.2V supply and is suitable for analog baseband signal processing in 60-GHz wireless communication systems. Furthermore, the proposed design is realized only based on CMOS devices without inductor and resistor which means small area and insensitive to process variation.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929458/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6929458/","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693433","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"A 1.2-GHz bandwidth variable gain amplifier with continuous dB-linear control in 65nm CMOS","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 1.2-GHz bandwidth variable gain amplifier with continuous dB-linear control in 65nm CMOS","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper1335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054537S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929458","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":6929462,"authors":[{"name":"Fanyi Meng","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Fanyi","lastName":"Meng","id":"37302365200"},{"name":"Kaixue Ma","affiliation":["University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), Chengdu, China","School of Electrical and Electronics, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kaixue","lastName":"Ma","id":"37289937100"},{"name":"Kiat Seng Yeo","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Kiat Seng","lastName":"Yeo","id":"37277042100"},{"name":"Shanshan Xu","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Shanshan","lastName":"Xu","id":"38235990700"},{"name":"Chirn Chye Boon","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Chirn Chye","lastName":"Boon","id":"37408579300"},{"name":"Wei Meng Lim","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Electronics, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore"],"firstName":"Wei Meng","lastName":"Lim","id":"37599560200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929462","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":397},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Inductors","Gain","Noise measurement","CMOS integrated circuits","Q-factor","Transmission line measurements","Low-noise amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS analogue integrated circuits","field effect MIMIC","inductors","low noise amplifiers","millimetre wave amplifiers","Q-factor"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS","Q-factor enhanced inductors","high gain low-noise amplifier","asymmetrical ground plane","EM simulation","three-stage cascade low-noise amplifier","Global Foundries","DC power consumption","noise figure","average output","core size","frequency 60 GHz","gain 26.3 dB","size 65 nm","power 21.8 mW"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929462","abstract":"In this paper, a 60-GHz high gain low-noise amplifier is designed and verified experimentally.

The structure derives from the traditional mushroom, but with the unique shape of the patch, the change of via's position, and the inverted T shape layout of the structure unit cells. The via's position is optimized in the HFSS software, and the simulated results shows that the mutual coupling is largely improved with the S21 parameter as significant -32dB. In addition, the return loss and the radiation characteristic still remain in the reasonable level, proving that the EBG structures are effective and reliable for the MIMO antenna system.","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929527","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929527.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929527","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mutual coupling reduction of a 2.6 GHz Dual-Element MIMO Antenna System with EBG structures","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929527","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Mutual coupling reduction of a 2.6 GHz Dual-Element MIMO Antenna System with EBG structures","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929527/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693347","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6929527/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mutual coupling reduction of a 2.6 GHz Dual-Element MIMO Antenna System with EBG structures","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper1841.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034175S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929527","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-19"},{"_id":6929631,"authors":[{"name":"Yuntao Li","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectonic Equipment, Equipment Academy, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yuntao","lastName":"Li","id":"37598942700"},{"name":"Xin Jia","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectonic Equipment, Equipment Academy, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Jia","id":"37085485064"},{"name":"Yongguang Chen","affiliation":["Generate Research institute of Measurement and Communication, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Yongguang","lastName":"Chen","id":"37069008300"},{"name":"Canbin Yin","affiliation":["Department of Optoelectonic Equipment, Equipment Academy, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Canbin","lastName":"Yin","id":"37532205800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929631","dbTime":"14 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":279},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Jamming","Frequency modulation","Imaging","Synthetic aperture radar","Azimuth","Radar imaging"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency agility","image resolution","jamming","MIMO radar","radar imaging","synthetic aperture radar"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["frequency agility","MIMO-SAR imaging","anti-deception jamming performance","multiple-input multiple-output synthetic aperture radar","pulse repetition interval","PRI","baseband signals","step carrier frequencies","signal recombination technique","high resolution imagery"]}],"abstract":"Imaging proceduce for frequency agility multiple-input multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR) in presence of deception jamming is proposed, where the radar, at each pulse repetition interval (PRI), emits a waveform by one antenna, and the transmitted baseband signals are modulated with step carrier frequencies in successive PRIs.

Owing to the limitation in bandwidth of currently used frequency bands, future fifth generation (5G) mobile networks will need to operate at higher frequencies. Analysis of the multipath propagation in dynamic single and multi-user scenarios under time-variant shadowing environments with high bandwidth requires a millimetre-wave (mm-wave) channel sounder (CS). It must provide ultra-wideband (UWB) real-time operation with multiple antennas and a high dynamic range. In addition, polarimetric information is needed to fully characterise the wireless channel, e.g. for cases of polarisation misalignment at the mobile device. This paper presents a novel UWB dual-polarised (DP) mm-wave channel sounder architecture for real time measurements in 5G mobile networks to overcome these requirements. We also show measurement data to motivate the need for polarimetric double-directional measurements.","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929647","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929647.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929647","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Ultrawideband 3D mmWave channel sounding for 5G","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929647","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929647/","displayDocTitle":"Ultrawideband 3D mmWave channel sounding for 5G","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693530","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6929647/","conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Ultrawideband 3D mmWave channel sounding for 5G","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper2562.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.074168S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"6","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929647","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":6929648,"authors":[{"name":"Diego Dupleich","affiliation":["Ilmcnau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Diego","lastName":"Dupleich","id":"37085364097"},{"name":"Franco Fuschini","affiliation":["Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, Sasso Marconi, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Franco","lastName":"Fuschini","id":"37279133900"},{"name":"Robert Mueller","affiliation":["Ilmcnau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Mueller","id":"37085409741"},{"name":"Enrico Vitucci","affiliation":["Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, Sasso Marconi, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Enrico","lastName":"Vitucci","id":"37318535500"},{"name":"Christian Schneider","affiliation":["Ilmcnau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Schneider","id":"37323248800"},{"name":"Vittorio Degli Esposti","affiliation":["Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, Sasso Marconi, Bologna, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Degli Esposti","id":"37542788100"},{"name":"Reiner Thom\u00e4","affiliation":["Ilmcnau University of Technology, Ilmenau, Germany"],"firstName":"Reiner","lastName":"Thom\u00e4","id":"37279111800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929648","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":28,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":503},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Delays","Azimuth","Scattering","Wireless communication","Antennas","US Department of Defense"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","diversity reception","indoor radio","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["directional characterization","indoor-office channel","directional dual-link quad-polarized channel measurements","small-office environment","multigigabit system","beam-forming","macrodiversity solutions","polarization","frequency 60 GHz"]}],"abstract":"Directional, dual-link, quad-polarized 60GHz channel measurements have been carried out in a small-office environment.

Over the last decade, the desire for increased data rate and efficient spectrum utilisation in wireless communication systems has evolved the basic single-input single-output (SISO) communication system model into one where multiple antennas are now deployed at both ends of the communication system following the pioneering work of Foschini, Gans and Telatar [1-2]. This system of multiple antennas now commonly referred to as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication or more generally space-time communication promises an increase in data rate commensurate to the minimum number of antennas deployed at either end of the communication system in multipath rich channel conditions. As a result, a flurry of research efforts has been on to explore the possibility of adopting the MIMO concept into many legacy communication systems. Most of the research has so far focused on the UHF, VHF and SHF bands. In the HF band the presence of different ionization layers in the ionosphere and ground reflections leads to multiple paths connecting the transmitter and the receiver. These multiple paths result in a low data rate which might be alleviated using MIMO technology. However, unlike propagation in the higher frequency bands, the number of multiple paths in the HF band is limited which can lead to a moderate increase in the data rate for MIMO systems. Given the advances recorded in the application of MIMO techniques to other existing communication systems, recently, some effort has been directed at the HF band. However, much of this work has been in experimental measurements [3-5], while others such as [6-7] have focused on establishing the channel capacity increase and de-correlation between transmit and receive antennas, with little effort directed at establishing the potential system performance. In this paper, we present the bit error rate (BER) performance evaluation of the HF channel based on field measurements conducted on a 255 km radio link between Durham and Leicester, in the UK, using heterogeneous co-located antennas reported in [4-5]. The transmission consisted of continuous wave (CW) transmissions using a nominal frequency of 5.255 MHz, with a 10 Hz separation between transmissions to help distinguish the signals at the receiver. The received data were then filtered to recover the received CW signals. Detailed description of the experimental set up is reported in [5]. Samples of the filtered received CW signals are shown in Fig. 1. The data were further processed to extract the MIMO channel matrices and used to characterize the MIMO channel in our simulator. A spatial multiplexing (SM), MIMO simulator was designed with four different detection schemes. These are linear Zero-Forcing detector, an Ordered Successive Interference Cancellation (OSIC) VBLAST/ZF detector, as well as a sphere decoder (SD), which is essentially a low complexity maximum likelihood (ML) detector. The results for a 2 by 2 MIMO system employing QPSK are displayed in Figure 2 and compared with the SISO curve.","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929715","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929715.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929715","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","startPage":"1","endPage":"2","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"BER performance evaluation of HF MIMO spatial multiplexing systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929715","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"BER performance evaluation of HF MIMO spatial multiplexing systems","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929715/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14694218","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","htmlLink":"/document/6929715/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER performance evaluation of HF MIMO spatial multiplexing systems","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper2898.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040518S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"},{"_id":6929815,"authors":[{"name":"Zeren Zhima","affiliation":["China Earthquake Administration, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zeren","lastName":"Zhima"},{"name":"Zhang XueMin","affiliation":["China Earthquake Administration, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"XueMin"},{"name":"Shen XuHui","affiliation":["China Earthquake Administration, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Shen","lastName":"XuHui"},{"name":"Sun Weihuai","affiliation":["Tonghai Geomagnetic Station, Earthquake Administration of YunNan Province"],"firstName":"Sun","lastName":"Weihuai"},{"name":"Ning DongMei","affiliation":["Earthquake Administration of Ya'an City, Sichuan Province"],"firstName":"Ning","lastName":"DongMei"},{"name":"Yuri Ruzhin","affiliation":["Institut zemnogo magnetizma ionosfery i rasprostranenia radiovoln imeni N V Puskova RAN, Troitsk, RU"],"firstName":"Yuri","lastName":"Ruzhin"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4673-5225-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"6929815","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Earthquakes","Radio transmitters","Cities and towns","Receivers","Artificial intelligence","Ionosphere"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric electromagnetic wave propagation","earthquakes","geophysical signal processing","magnetic storms","radionavigation","radiowave propagation","statistical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VLF radio signal anomalies","very low frequency radio signal receiving network","Russian Alpha radio navigation system","China","quartile-based method","VLF signal propagation variations","shallow earthquakes","strong earthquakes","Yushu earthquake","Lushan earthquake","statistical analysis","Dst index","Kp index","geomagnetic storms","VLF propagation anomaly"]}],"abstract":"The VLF (Very Low Frequency) radio signal receiving network of Russian Alpha radio navigation system has been established in China since 2010.

The wind measurements by Langfang meteor radar and UK Meteorological Office (UKMO) wind data are combining used to present their anomalous behaviors response to the event. These winds reveal significant anomalies in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) zonal wind over mid-latitude corresponding to the 2013 major warming by comparing to the observations in 2010/2011 when no major warming occurred and could be considered as the normal condition. Results show that the westward wind at 60\u00b0N during 2013 major SSW was first observed between 40 km and 53 km and then extended to lower stratosphere and mesosphere. Over mid-latitude, the eastward wind reversed to westward during January 4-15, 2013 at about 80 km with the maximum value of 48.4 m/s on January 11 by UKMO data, while the reversals of MLT daily mean zonal wind persisted from January 8 to 14 observed by meteor radar with the maximum value of 40.2 m/s at 98 km also on January 11. The period of this wind reversal and the date of the maximum wind actually coincide with the mesospheric response at high latitude to the 2013 major warming. These observations and analysis document clearly the impact of a major SSW on the MLT dynamics over the mid-latitude.","displayPublicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","pdfPath":"/iel7/6916487/6928981/06929843.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"2014 XXXIth URSI General Assembly and Scientific Symposium (URSI GASS)","doi":"10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929843","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/URSIGASS.2014.6929843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6928981","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6929843","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Response of mesosphere and lower thermosphere wind over mid-latitude to the 2013 major sudden stratospheric warming event","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Terrestrial atmosphere","Radar antennas","Meteorological radar","Atmospheric modeling","Atmospheric measurements"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric temperature","mesosphere","stratosphere","thermosphere","wind"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["MLT dynamics","mesospheric response","MLT daily mean zonal wind reversal","AD 2013 January 04 to 15","eastward wind reversal","MLT zonal wind","anomalous behavior","UKMO wind data","UK Meteorological Office","Langfang meteor radar","wind measurement","China","SSW event","atmospheric wind variation","major sudden stratospheric warming event","lower thermosphere wind","mesosphere wind","altitude 40 km to 53 km","altitude 80 km","velocity 48.4 m/s","velocity 40.2 m/s"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/6929843/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","displayDocTitle":"Response of mesosphere and lower thermosphere wind over mid-latitude to the 2013 major sudden stratospheric warming event","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/6929843/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2014","accessionNumber":"14693238","dateOfInsertion":"20 October 2014","conferenceDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Response of mesosphere and lower thermosphere wind over mid-latitude to the 2013 major sudden stratospheric warming event","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"ursipaper2366.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.024747S","chronDate":"16-23 Aug. 2014","xplore-pub-id":"6916487","isNumber":"6928981","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"6916487","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"6928981","articleId":"6929843","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2014","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-07"}]
