In the first implementation, the neural network is interconnected and programmed so that it can execute a maximum matching algorithm and thereby substitute appropriate fault-free spare elements for the faulty components. The second implementation rearranges the surviving fault-free processors to restore the logical structure, and it can adjust its interconnection complexity based on the quality of solution (i.e., performance) desired. These two approaches are compared with the traditional reconfiguration algorithms, and by simulation it is shown that the neural network techniques provide superior performance (i.e., higher survivability rates). It is also shown that the intrinsic fault-tolerant nature of neural networks provides a degradable reconfiguration control even in the presence of faulty neural network components.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.240073","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6168/00240073.pdf","startPage":"1255","endPage":"1265","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6168","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.240073","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Restructuring of square processor arrays by built-in self-repair circuit","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=240073","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Restructuring of square processor arrays by built-in self-repair circuit","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240073/","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4591464","volume":"12","issue":"9","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restructuring of square processor arrays by built-in self-repair circuit","sourcePdf":"00240073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090789S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"7","articleId":"240073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":240074,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

This approach is important for industrial applications, because it provides exploration of optimal synthesized architectures and early architectural decisions have the greatest impact on the final design. An integer programming formulation of the architectural synthesis problem is transformed into the mode packing problem. Polyhedral theory is used to formulate constraints that decrease the size of the search space, thus improving solution efficiency. Execution times are an order of magnitude faster than for previous heuristic techniques. The present approach breaks new ground by (1) simultaneously scheduling and allocating in practical execution times, (2) guaranteeing globally optimal solutions for a specific objective function, and (3) providing a polynomial run-time algorithm for solving some instances of this NP-complete problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/43.240074","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel1/43/6168/00240074.pdf","startPage":"1266","endPage":"1278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/43.240074","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6168","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=240074","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Global optimization approach for architectural synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240074/","displayDocTitle":"Global optimization approach for architectural synthesis","volume":"12","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4591465","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Global optimization approach for architectural synthesis","sourcePdf":"00240074.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113099S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"60","articleId":"240074","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":240079,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Two case studies illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on a snake-like robot.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.1991.240390","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Advanced Robotics 'Robots in Unstructured Environments","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Advanced Robotics 'Robots in Unstructured Environments","pdfPath":"/iel4/564/6178/00240390.pdf","startPage":"1211","endPage":"1216 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR.1991.240390","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A general framework for managing multiple tasks in highly redundant robotic systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=240390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 1991","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240390/","displayDocTitle":"A general framework for managing multiple tasks in highly redundant robotic systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4478137","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A general framework for managing multiple tasks in highly redundant robotic systems","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"00240390.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06011S","chronDate":"19-22 June 1991","isNumber":"6178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"564","citationCount":"323","articleId":"240390","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-21"},{"_id":240420,"authors":[{"name":"J.-P.

The proposed technique allows one to model all those cases in which purely kinematic constraints imposed on the robot end-effector live together with dynamic interactions. Suitable parametrizations are introduced for the environment configurations and constrained end-effector poses and for the exchanged forces. The generalized directions of 'static' environment reaction forces (orthogonal to the directions of admissible end-effector motion) and those of 'active' forces (responsible for energy transfer between robot and environment) are formally characterized. The overall dynamics of the robot-environment system is then derived in a unique framework. The obtained model structure is shown to be suitable for the design of hybrid control laws. Simple but significative examples are reported to illustrate the modeling procedure.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.1991.240592","startPage":"568","endPage":"574 vol.1","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Advanced Robotics 'Robots in Unstructured Environments","pdfPath":"/iel4/564/6178/00240592.pdf","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Advanced Robotics 'Robots in Unstructured Environments","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR.1991.240592","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the modeling of robots in contact with a dynamic environment","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Kinematics","Energy exchange","Service robots","Equations","Robot sensing systems","Electrical equipment industry","Robotic assembly","Deburring","Industrial control","Impedance"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["control system analysis","dynamics","kinematics","robots"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robots","dynamic environment","modeling","kinematic constraints","dynamic interactions","energy transfer","model structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240592/","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"On the modeling of robots in contact with a dynamic environment","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1991","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"19-22 June 1991","accessionNumber":"4463004","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the modeling of robots in contact with a dynamic environment","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"00240592.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058167S","chronDate":"19-22 June 1991","isNumber":"6178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"564","citationCount":"12","articleId":"240592","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":240642,"authors":[{"name":"G.

Passivity analysis provides a convenient framework for analyzing such systems while accommodating for arbitrary environment interactions and human operator inputs. Though stability is fundamental, practical usefulness is determined by transient characteristics. Thus, this paper focuses on the transient behavior of stable force-reflecting teleoperation systems. It builds on the notion of impedance matching to select the controller structure and tune the controller parameters, and finds a symmetric controller configuration to provide the best behavior. It also includes a tuning mechanism to trade-off the accuracy of force-reflection (and feeling of telepresence) with the possible speeds of operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6178","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICAR.1991.240642","publicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Advanced Robotics 'Robots in Unstructured Environments","displayPublicationTitle":"Fifth International Conference on Advanced Robotics 'Robots in Unstructured Environments","pdfPath":"/iel4/564/6178/00240642.pdf","startPage":"261","endPage":"266 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/ICAR.1991.240642","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transient shaping in force-reflecting teleoperation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"19-22 June 1991","displayDocTitle":"Transient shaping in force-reflecting teleoperation","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"19-22 June 1991","publicationDate":"1991","accessionNumber":"4459146","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240642/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transient shaping in force-reflecting teleoperation","confLoc":"Pisa, Italy","sourcePdf":"00240642.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.022701S","chronDate":"19-22 June 1991","isNumber":"6178","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"564","citationCount":"13","articleId":"240642","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1991","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":240676,"authors":[{"name":"S.

Also of interest is the use of custom monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs) for 3.3 GHz implementation, supported by ASICs and EPLD interface circuits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/639/6179/00240727.pdf","startPage":"15.05/1","endPage":"15.05/5","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240727","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240727","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Spread spectrum indoor video transmission","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Spread spectrum indoor video transmission","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240727/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4454778","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Spread spectrum indoor video transmission","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00240727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056091S","chronDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"639","citationCount":"5","articleId":"240727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":240758,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The authors propose a two tier PCS system. The low tier (local service or PCS/LS) system is based on a low power, low cost TDM/TDMA access method using a microcell structure with a 25 cell reuse pattern designed for pedestrian usage. The high tier (enhanced service or PCS/ES) system, on the other hand, is a high capacity system designed for a cellular type coverage with a 1-cell reuse pattern. Major emphasis is placed on the enhanced system design. This system is based on a combination of slow frequency hopping CDMA (SFH-CDMA) with TDMA structure. Careful design of TDMA slots allow for a slow synthesizer requirement. Also, use of short constraint length convolutional codes combined with MLSE equalization provides a high coding gain even at long delay spreads. These functions, due to their highly parallel structure can be efficiently integrated using custom ICs for low cost design. The modem performance of PCS/ES system in a cellular environment is investigated for both max-ratio and selection diversity. Based on the modem performance, system capacity is derived and then compared with AMPS cellular system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/639/6179/00240758.pdf","startPage":"10.05/1","endPage":"10.05/5","publicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240758","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240758","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=240758","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Low cost high performance CDMA system for US PCS","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Costs","Multiaccess communication","Personal communication networks","Time division multiple access","Modems","Time division multiplexing","Microcell networks","Frequency","Synthesizers","Convolutional codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","code division multiple access","convolutional codes","frequency agility","personal communication networks","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high performance","CDMA system","personal communication systems","wireline phone system","tetherless system","local service","low cost","TDM/TDMA","microcell structure","cell reuse pattern","pedestrian usage","enhanced service","slow frequency hopping CDMA","short constraint length convolutional codes","MLSE equalization","max-ratio","selection diversity","AMPS cellular system"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240758/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Low cost high performance CDMA system for US PCS","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4446066","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Low cost high performance CDMA system for US PCS","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00240758.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044987S","chronDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"639","citationCount":"5","articleId":"240758","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":240759,"authors":[{"name":"U.

The channel output is first passed through a filter matched to the chip waveform and then sampled at the chip rate. Because of the complexity and coefficient noise associated with such an adaptive filter when N is large, simpler structures with fewer adaptive components are proposed. In each case the multiple samples per symbol are combined via a trapped delay line, where the taps are selected to minimize the mean square error. It is shown that the complexity of both of these schemes are comparable, but that the first scheme is somewhat more effective in cancelling interference.

After a brief discussion of general technological issues related to the selection of a MAC approach for PCN, dynamic TDMA and packet CDMA protocols appropriate for the support of integrated voice/data traffic are described. Performance evaluation methodologies for determining the system capacities of these competing MAC techniques are described. System-level performance measures such as channel utilization, voice blocking probability and data delay are obtained from a detailed simulation model for the D-TDMA case, and compared with a preliminary set of corresponding results for asynchronous packet CDMA. Overall, the results show that while CDMA does achieve a higher normalized capacity than TDMA, the gains are very sensitive to the propagation loss constant, and must be balanced against higher message transfer delay for certain data services.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240760","publicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/639/6179/00240760.pdf","startPage":"10.03/1","endPage":"10.03/6","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00240760.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240760","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"CDMA versus dynamic TDMA for access control in an integrated voice/data PCN","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=240760","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240760/","displayDocTitle":"CDMA versus dynamic TDMA for access control in an integrated voice/data PCN","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4446064","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"CDMA versus dynamic TDMA for access control in an integrated voice/data PCN","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00240760.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037282S","chronDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"639","citationCount":"7","articleId":"240760","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":240771,"authors":[{"name":"J.J.

This is done by means of a delay-lock loop (DLL). The differential equation of an incoherent second-order DLL has been programmed. The mean time to lose lock (MTLL) of the DLL is a very important design parameter. The authors have obtained this parameter by computer simulation and are able to plot the MTLL as a function of the signal to noise ratio in the data bandwidth. In a narrow-band system, the simulation shows that the effect of the fast Rayleigh fading is a performance degradation even with high mean signal to noise ratio. Assuming a wide-band system, so that the receiver has enough bandwidth to resolve the different propagation paths, the authors propose a modified DLL scheme. The MTLL of the proposed DLL is evaluated using a dynamic simulation of the multipath channel. The results show an improvement with respect to the conventional DLL.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/639/6179/00240771.pdf","startPage":"08.04/1","endPage":"08.04/5","publicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240771","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240771","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=240771","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis of a second order delay-lock loop with application to a CDMA system with multipath propagation","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Performance analysis","Delay","Signal to noise ratio","Bandwidth","Multiaccess communication","Differential equations","Computer simulation","Narrowband","Computational modeling","Rayleigh channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","digital simulation","fading","radio systems","radiowave propagation","telecommunications computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["second order delay-lock loop","CDMA system","multipath propagation","synchronization","differential equation","mean time to lose lock","computer simulation","signal to noise ratio","data bandwidth","fast Rayleigh fading","performance degradation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240771/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of a second order delay-lock loop with application to a CDMA system with multipath propagation","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4446053","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of a second order delay-lock loop with application to a CDMA system with multipath propagation","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00240771.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.040186S","chronDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"639","citationCount":"1","articleId":"240771","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":240775,"authors":[{"name":"M.A. Mokhtar","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering Department, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, USA"],"firstName":"M.A.","lastName":"Mokhtar","id":"38275601000"},{"name":"S.C.

The approach is verified by comparing the results with two canonical examples where closed form solutions exist.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240792","publicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","displayPublicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/639/6179/00240792.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240792","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179","startPage":"04.05/1","endPage":"04.05/6","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Geometrical ray tracing approach for indoor wave propagation in a corridor","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=240792","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Geometrical ray tracing approach for indoor wave propagation in a corridor","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240792/","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4446032","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Geometrical ray tracing approach for indoor wave propagation in a corridor","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00240792.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049218S","chronDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"639","citationCount":"1","articleId":"240792","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":240821,"authors":[{"name":"M.E.

This is explained by the following observation: for independent flat-Rayleigh fading wireless systems with N mutually interfering users, it is demonstrated that with K+N antennas, N-1 interferers can be nulled out and K+1 path diversity improvement can be achieved by each of the N users. Monte Carlo evaluations show that these results also hold with frequency selective fading when optimum equalization is used at the receiver. Thus an N-fold increase in user capacity can be achieved, allowing for modular growth and improved performance by increasing the number of antennas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","pdfPath":"/iel2/639/6179/00240826.pdf","startPage":"02.01/1","endPage":"02.01/5","publicationTitle":"1st International Conference on Universal Personal Communications - ICUPC '92 Proceedings","doi":"10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240826","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICUPC.1992.240826","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6179","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=240826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The capacity of wireless communication systems can be substantially increased by the use of antenna diversity","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Wireless communication","Diversity reception","Frequency","Wireless LAN","Interference cancellation","Rayleigh channels","Mobile antennas","Lifting equipment","Local area networks","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel capacity","diversity reception","fading","local area networks","mobile radio systems","Monte Carlo methods","personal communication networks","radiotelephony"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["capacity","wireless communication systems","antenna diversity","wireless PBX/LAN networks","spatial diversity","optimum combining","flat-Rayleigh fading wireless systems","Monte Carlo evaluations","frequency selective fading"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/240826/","chronOrPublicationDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","displayDocTitle":"The capacity of wireless communication systems can be substantially increased by the use of antenna diversity","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4454754","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"29 Sept.-1 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The capacity of wireless communication systems can be substantially increased by the use of antenna diversity","confLoc":"Dallas, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00240826.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027387S","chronDate":"29 Sep-1 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6179","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"639","citationCount":"46","articleId":"240826","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":241279,"authors":[{"name":"S.D.

An EMB is a modular unit consisting of an evacuated housing containing a fiber-composite rotor. The rotor is supported by magnetic bearings and contains an integrally mounted permanent magnet array. Recent developments in high-strength fibers, in permanent-magnet materials, and in solid-state power electronics allow the design of small (1 kW-h) modular EMBs for full-or hybrid-electric vehicles, and larger size modules (25 kW-h) for a variety of stationary storage needs. Design issues for EMBs with rotors made up of nested cylinders are addressed. Rotational stability, stress distributions, generator/motor power and efficiency, power conversion, and cost are discussed. It is concluded that the use of EMBs in electric autos could result in a fivefold reduction (relative to the IC engine) in the primary energy input required for urban driving, with a concommitant major positive impact on the economy and on air pollution.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241483/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"March  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  1993","publicationDate":"March 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4477151","volume":"81","issue":"3","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A high-efficiency electromechanical battery","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A high-efficiency electromechanical battery","sourcePdf":"00241483.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068991S","chronDate":"March  1993","isNumber":"6201","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"42","articleId":"241483","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":241504,"authors":[{"name":"N.

The main characteristics of this approach are that it relies on the assumption that image redundancy can be efficiently captured and exploited through piecewise self-transformability on a block-wise basis, and it approximates an original image by a fractal image, obtained from a finite number of iterations of an image transformation called a fractal code. This approach is referred to as fractal block coding. The general coding-decoding system is based on the construction, for an image to be encoded, of a fractal code-a contractive image transformation for which the original image is an approximate fixed point-which, when applied iteratively on any initial image of the decoder, produces a sequence of images which converges to a fractal approximation of the original. The design of a system for the encoding of monochrome digital images at rates below 1 b/pixel is described.

It becomes possible by not focusing on the realization of the Jacobi rotation with a CORDIC processor, but by applying approximate rotations and adjusting them to single steps of the CORDIC algorithm, i.e., only one angle of the CORDIC angle sequence defines the Jacobi rotation in each step. This angle can be determined by some shift, add and compare operations. Although only linear convergence is obtained for the most simple version of the new algorithm, the overall operation count (shifts and adds) decreases dramatically. A slow increase of the number of involved CORDIC angles during the runtime retains quadratic convergence.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.241595","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6205/00241595.pdf","startPage":"1058","endPage":"1065","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.241595","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6205","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An efficient Jacobi-like algorithm for parallel eigenvalue computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"An efficient Jacobi-like algorithm for parallel eigenvalue computation","volume":"42","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4580567","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241595/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An efficient Jacobi-like algorithm for parallel eigenvalue computation","sourcePdf":"00241595.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.026044S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6205","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"61","articleId":"241595","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":241601,"authors":[{"name":"W.A.

It is shown that the technique of evaluating the -1 slope points on the inverter transfer function as used in most modern textbooks is not a valid and reliable approach to evaluating noise margin values. It is argued that the most reliable and reasonable criterion is to maximize the product of the two noise margins. This is equivalent to maximizing the area of a rectangle embedded within the loop formed by the transfer curves of an inverter pair. Most of the material presented can be found in the early literature on noise margin.

The results show that the drain-gate and gate-source capacitance nonlinearities generate distortion in the device in its off-state. These nonlinearities, which reflect the capacitance-voltage characteristic of the capacitances, can be reduced in as-fabricated devices by increasing the gate reverse bias voltage. The level of distortion monotonically increases with frequency throughout the usable range of the MESFET when used in a series reflective switch. In an SPDT switch application, where both on and off-state devices are used, the distortion level is relatively constant at frequencies in the vicinity of the gate bias cut-off frequency. The nonlinear off-state model is compared with both a SPICE-based analysis, and with experimental data on a GaAs MESFET SPDT switch. The main conclusions to be drawn from the study are that the dominate distortion generated by a GaAs MESFET used in a switch application occurs in the on-state, and that off-state distortion can be only slightly improved in as-fabricated devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241671/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","volume":"41","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"4587087","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Distortion in off-state arsenide MESFET switches","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distortion in off-state arsenide MESFET switches","sourcePdf":"00241671.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028766S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"8","articleId":"241671","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":241685,"authors":[{"name":"C.J.

The standard FDTD method is, however, less efficient if the structure under investigation has boundaries which are not parallel to the coordinate axes. Techniques designed to overcome this problem such as locally or globally deformed grids, or the use of nonorthogonal coordinate systems have been reported but these impose a penalty in computational effort or in flexibility. In this contribution, an alternative technique is described whereby the standard Cartesian grid is maintained, and the existence of the material boundaries is accounted for by the use of special finite difference equations for the affected nodes. These equations take account not only of the position of the boundaries but also of the asymptotic field behavior in their vicinity. This technique results in a flexible, accurate, and efficient, implementation which is applicable to a wide range of MMIC and antenna structures.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.241685","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6208/00241685.pdf","startPage":"1429","endPage":"1438","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.241685","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6208","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An algorithm for the treatment of curved metallic laminas in the finite difference time domain method","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=241685","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241685/","displayDocTitle":"An algorithm for the treatment of curved metallic laminas in the finite difference time domain method","volume":"41","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4592709","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An algorithm for the treatment of curved metallic laminas in the finite difference time domain method","sourcePdf":"00241685.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0444S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6208","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"6","articleId":"241685","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":241737,"authors":[{"name":"S.H.

Unfortunately, easily evaluated closed form expressions for these probabilities are almost impossible to derive due to the complexity of the stochastic systems usually encountered. Hence, one must often resort to simulation to obtain the desired quantities. The most obvious technique is Monte Carlo simulation, which directly counts the number of errors in repeated trials. The problem is that error probabilities are usually quite small, requiring numerous simulation runs to sufficiently \"hit\" the rare event to gain adequate knowledge of its statistics. This places severe demands on the computer's random number generator. Importance sampling strategies simulate under altered input signal distributions (e.g., translation or stretching) so as to \"speedup\" convergence of the error estimators. The authors discuss a speedup technique termed quick simulation based upon results in large deviation theory. The quick simulation method is shown to compare favorably with three other importance sampling techniques for simulating a simple nonlinear system with memory.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/26.241741","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.241741","startPage":"1610","endPage":"1617","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6210/00241741.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6210","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00241741.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quick simulation of detector error probabilities in the presence of memory and nonlinearity","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"Quick simulation of detector error probabilities in the presence of memory and nonlinearity","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"41","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4592839","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241741/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quick simulation of detector error probabilities in the presence of memory and nonlinearity","sourcePdf":"00241741.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029326S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"8","articleId":"241741","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":241742,"authors":[{"name":"F.

The authors describe a noncoherent all-digital delay lock loop (DDLL) suited for chip timing synchronization in band-limited direct sequence spread spectrum (DS/SS) systems, and they thoroughly analyze its performance. The key features of this novel scheme are represented by its low-complexity processing section together with its good tracking capability. Analytical expressions for the DDLL S-curve and steady-state timing jitter are derived and confirmed by a time-domain computer simulation. Furthermore, the Mean Time to Lose Lock (MTLL) of the loop is evaluated and some numerical results are reported. The proposed chip timing synchronization scheme reveals also an improved tracking performance when compared to the traditional analog DLL for rectangular chip DS/SS signals.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00241756.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/26/6210/00241756.pdf","startPage":"1760","endPage":"1769","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/26.241756","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/26.241756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6210","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=241756","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A digital chip timing recovery loop for band-limited direct-sequence spread-spectrum signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Spread spectrum communication","Modems","Multiaccess communication","Bandwidth","Satellite broadcasting","Space technology","Filtering","Tracking loops","Timing jitter","Time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital simulation","phase shift keying","signal processing","spread spectrum communication","synchronisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["digital chip timing recovery loop","direct-sequence spread-spectrum","transmission systems design","noncoherent all-digital delay lock loop","DDLL","chip timing synchronization","tracking","steady-state timing jitter","time-domain computer simulation","mean time to lose lock","band limited signals","BPSK"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"A digital chip timing recovery loop for band-limited direct-sequence spread-spectrum signals","volume":"41","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4592854","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A digital chip timing recovery loop for band-limited direct-sequence spread-spectrum signals","sourcePdf":"00241756.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031012S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6210","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"69","articleId":"241756","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":241881,"authors":[{"name":"M.

It is shown that this problem can be solved without classification or segmentation, a method that may be particularly useful in quantifying white matter lesions where the range of values associated with the lesions and the white matter may heavily overlap. The general technique utilizes a statistical model of the noise and partial volume effect together with a finite mixture density description of the tissues. The quantification is then formulated as a minimization problem of high order with up to six separate densities as part of the mixture. This problem is solved by tree annealing with and without partial volume utilized, the results compared, and the sensitivity of the tree annealing algorithm to various parameters is exhibited. The actual quantification is performed by two methods: a classification-based method called Bayes quantification, and parameter estimation. Results from each method are presented for synthetic and actual data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.241885","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00241885.png","startPage":"566","endPage":"574","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.241885","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6214","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6214/00241885.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Quantification of MR brain images by mixture density and partial volume modeling","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241885/","displayDocTitle":"Quantification of MR brain images by mixture density and partial volume modeling","volume":"12","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4592250","pubMedId":"18218450","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Quantification of MR brain images by mixture density and partial volume modeling","sourcePdf":"00241885.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039126S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"105","articleId":"241885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":241890,"authors":[{"name":"C.L.

Dosage reduction involves an inevitable sacrifice in image quality. In this work, the latter problem is addressed by first modeling the signal-dependent, Poisson-distributed noise that arises as a result of this dosage reduction. The commonly utilized noise model for single images is shown to be obtainable from the new model. Stochastic temporal filtering techniques are proposed to enhance clinical fluoroscopy sequences corrupted by quantum mottle. The temporal versions of these filters as developed here are more suitable for filtering image sequences, as correlations along the time axis can be utilized. For these dynamic sequences, the problem of displacement field estimation is treated in conjunction with the filtering stage to ensure that the temporal correlations are taken along the direction of motion to prevent object blur.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/42.241890","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","pdfPath":"/iel1/42/6214/00241890.pdf","startPage":"610","endPage":"621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6214","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/42.241890","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00241890.png","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=241890","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image sequence filtering in quantum-limited noise with applications to low-dose fluoroscopy","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241890/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Image sequence filtering in quantum-limited noise with applications to low-dose fluoroscopy","volume":"12","issue":"3","accessionNumber":"4592255","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","pubMedId":"18218455","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image sequence filtering in quantum-limited noise with applications to low-dose fluoroscopy","sourcePdf":"00241890.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058052S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6214","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"55","articleId":"241890","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":241930,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The signal power level at the output of each amplifier is the focus. It is found that this power level is the same throughout the system, and that it depends only on the amplifiers' gain characteristic and the span loss and is independent of the launched power at the input to the chain, provided it is close to the design value. As such, the systemwide signal power level is sensitive to systematic design and/or manufacturing errors. The sensitivity of the signal power level to errors in amplifier design and span loss is studied, and a simple technique is proposed that reduces this sensitivity, thus making the system more robust.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.241937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.241937","startPage":"1470","endPage":"1477","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6216/00241937.pdf","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6216","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00241937.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved robustness in long-haul lightwave all-amplifier systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Improved robustness in long-haul lightwave all-amplifier systems","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"11","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4586839","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241937/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved robustness in long-haul lightwave all-amplifier systems","sourcePdf":"00241937.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027427S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"1","articleId":"241937","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":241939,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Self-phase-modulation (SPM) in optical fiber can be equalized by an anomalous dispersion fiber, whereas pulse broadening caused by laser transient chirp can be compensated by normal dispersion. Using these characteristics, laser transient chirp, SPM, and fiber dispersion can be simultaneously compensated by equalizing fibers inserted within certain intervals. Optimum compensation is always realizable for such fixed equalizing fibers, since the magnitude of SPM can be controlled by changing the optical power in the fiber. Simulation suggests that this technique enables 10-Gb/s, 100-km fiber transmission by direct modulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/241939/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","volume":"11","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4586841","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Simultaneous compensation of laser chirp, Kerr effect, and dispersion in 10-Gb/s long-haul transmission systems","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Simultaneous compensation of laser chirp, Kerr effect, and dispersion in 10-Gb/s long-haul transmission systems","sourcePdf":"00241939.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053854S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6216","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"39","articleId":"241939","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":241940,"authors":[{"name":"Y.H.

Scheduling consists of two parts, the processors assignment of tasks, also called clustering, and the ordering of tasks for execution in each processor. The authors introduce two types of clusterings: nonlinear and linear clusterings. A clustering is nonlinear if two parallel tasks are mapped in the same cluster otherwise it is linear. Linear clustering fully exploits the natural parallelism of a given directed acyclic task graph (DAG) while nonlinear clustering sequentializes independent tasks to reduce parallelism. The authors also introduce a new quantification of the granularity of a DAG and define a coarse grain DAG as the one whose granularity is greater than one. It is proved that every nonlinear clustering of a coarse grain DAG can be transformed into a linear clustering that has less or equal parallel time than the nonlinear one. This result is used to prove the optimality of some important linear clusterings used in parallel numerical computing.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.242154","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00242154.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6224/00242154.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.242154","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6224","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"686","endPage":"701","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"On the granularity and clustering of directed acyclic task graphs","volume":"4","issue":"6","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4522317","publicationDate":"June 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242154/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the granularity and clustering of directed acyclic task graphs","sourcePdf":"00242154.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.042984S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"194","articleId":"242154","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":242156,"authors":[{"name":"S.

This technique accounts for interprocessor communication (IPC) overheads and considers interconnection constraints in the architecture so that shared resource contention can be avoided. The algorithm initially invokes a new clustering method that uses graph-analysis techniques to isolate parallelism instances. When constructing an initial set of clusters, this procedure explicitly addresses the tradeoff between exploiting parallelism and incurring communication cost. By hierarchically combining these clusters and then systematically decomposing this hierarchy, the declustering method exposes parallelism instances in order of importance and attains a cluster granularity that fits the characteristics of the architecture. It is shown that declustering retains the clustering advantage of avoiding IPC, yet overcomes the inflexibility associated with traditional clustering approaches.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.242160","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6224/00242160.pdf","startPage":"625","endPage":"637","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00242160.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.242160","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6224","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Declustering: a new multiprocessor scheduling technique","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242160/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","displayDocTitle":"Declustering: a new multiprocessor scheduling technique","volume":"4","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","accessionNumber":"4522311","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Declustering: a new multiprocessor scheduling technique","sourcePdf":"00242160.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083601S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6224","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"46","articleId":"242160","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":242214,"authors":[{"name":"H.

The LNA is used as the front end followed by an image rejection mixer (IRM). These MMICs were fabricated in the 0.1- mu m AlGaAs-InGaAs-GaAs HEMT production line. The LNA demonstrated a typical 17-dB gain and 4.5-5.5-dB noise figure at 94 GHz. The complete monolithic IRD has a measured conversion gain of 7-9 dB with a single-side-band noise figure of 6 dB when downconverting a 93-95-GHz RF signal to 50-500 MHz. The downconversion requires an LO power of 9 dBm. The development of these MMICs shows the increasing maturity of GaAs-based HEMT MMIC technology at W-band.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.242214","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/6226/00242214.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"283","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00242214.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.242214","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6226","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-yield W-band monolithic HEMT low-noise amplifier and image rejection downconverter chips","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=242214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242214/","displayDocTitle":"High-yield W-band monolithic HEMT low-noise amplifier and image rejection downconverter chips","volume":"3","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4522508","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-yield W-band monolithic HEMT low-noise amplifier and image rejection downconverter chips","sourcePdf":"00242214.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038672S","chronDate":"Aug.  1993","isNumber":"6226","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"28","articleId":"242214","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":242218,"authors":[{"name":"F.

II. Function realization","abstract":"For pt. I see ibid vol. 40, no. 8 p 503-14 (1993). The performance of the set of operators proposed in pt. I is compared with existing sets of operators for the realization of multiple-valued logic (MVL) functions. In pt. I, a set of operators was proposed consisting of literal, cycle, complement of literal, complement of cycle, min, and tsum operators (Set 1). This set of operators is compared to two existing sets of operators consisting of literal, complement of literal, min, and tsum operators (Set 2) and literal, min, and tsum operators (Set 3). For 3-valued 2-variable MVL functions, it is shown that the maximum number of product terms (PTs) required to realize all functions can be reduced to three PTs (using the Set 1 operators) from five PTs (using the Set 2 operators) and six PTs (using the Set 3 operators). In addition, it is shown that the average number of PTs required to realize all the functions reduces to 2.61 (using the Set 1 operators) from 3.19 (using the Set 2 operators) and 3.61 (using the Set 3 operators). It is anticipated that similar improvements are possible for higher valued logic. Realizations of a 4-valued 2-variable function based on different sets of operators are included to support such a claim.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242321/","volume":"40","issue":"8","accessionNumber":"4594454","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"CMOS multiple-valued logic design.

With the transform, it is possible to zoom into any desired frequency channels for further decomposition. In contrast, the conventional pyramid-structured wavelet transform performs further decomposition in low-frequency channels. A progressive texture classification algorithm which is not only computationally attractive but also has excellent performance is developed.

It is based on a transformation of variables technique and is equivalent to the generalized McClellan transformation. Methods for designing a whole class of transformation are given. The approach consists of two parts; design of the transformation and design of the 1-D filters. The use of Lagrange halfband filters to design the 1-D filters is discussed. The modification of a particular Lagrange halfband filter which gives a pair of simple 1-D filters that are almost similar to each other in their frequency characteristics but still form a perfect reconstruction pair is presented. The design technique is extended to other types of two-channel sampling lattice and subband shapes, in particular, the parallelogram and the diagonally quadrant subband cases.

A recursive-least-squares approach with iterative regularization is developed in the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain. When the input frames are processed recursively, the reconstruction does not converge in general due to the measurement noise and ill-conditioned nature of the deblurring. Through the iterative update of the regularization function and the proper choice of the regularization parameter, good high-resolution reconstructions of low-resolution, blurred, and noisy input frames are obtained. The proposed algorithm minimizes the computational requirements and provides a parallel computation structure since the reconstruction is done independently for each DFT element. Computer simulations demonstrate the performance of the algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image reconstruction","Image restoration","Equations","Iterative methods","Iterative algorithms","Computer simulation","Image resolution","Concurrent computing","Application software","Additive noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fast Fourier transforms","image reconstruction","iterative methods","least squares approximations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RLS method","DFT domain","blurred multiframe images","high-resolution image reconstruction","noisy multiple-input frames","recursive-least-squares approach","iterative regularization","discrete Fourier transform","parallel computation structure"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=242363","doi":"10.1109/83.242363","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/83/6231/00242363.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/83.242363","startPage":"534","endPage":"539","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6231","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recursive high-resolution reconstruction of blurred multiframe images","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Recursive high-resolution reconstruction of blurred multiframe images","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242363/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1993","volume":"2","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4573161","pubMedId":"18296238","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recursive high-resolution reconstruction of blurred multiframe images","sourcePdf":"00242363.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046461S","chronDate":"Oct.  1993","isNumber":"6231","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"170","articleId":"242363","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":242425,"authors":[{"name":"L.M.

A dynamic musculoskeletal model capable of simulating a spinal cord injured (SCI) person exercising on a stimulation-powered leg cycle ergometer was developed to explore these issues. This model was used to address the concern whether performance can be improved by changing seat configuration, the loading, or the intermuscle stimulation pattern. Performance was assessed in terms of the probability that a given SCI subject would be able to maintain a steady cadence, the relative strength required by each muscle group to pedal alone, and the estimated rate of metabolic energy utilization associated with steady-state pedaling. The authors considered the sensitivity of the model predictions to intersubject variability. Several strategies are suggested for either minimizing the strength needed to pedal, or maximizing the cardiovascular aerobic exercise.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jun 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jun 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242425/","volume":"1","issue":"2","accessionNumber":"4594967","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"June 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Improving the efficacy of electrical stimulation-induced leg cycle ergometry: an analysis based on a dynamic musculoskeletal model","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the efficacy of electrical stimulation-induced leg cycle ergometry: an analysis based on a dynamic musculoskeletal model","sourcePdf":"00242425.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.075746S","chronDate":"Jun 1993","isNumber":"6233","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"86","citationCount":"127","articleId":"242425","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":242438,"authors":[{"name":"A.Y.

This signal can be reconstructed by interpolation from a downsampled sequence of pitch-cycle waveforms with a rate of one prototype waveform per 20-30 ms interval. The prototype waveform is described by a set of linear-prediction (LP) filter coefficients describing the formant structure and a prototype excitation waveform, quantized with analysis-by-synthesis procedures. The speech signal is reconstructed by filtering an excitation signal consisting of the concatenation of (infinitesimal) sections of the instantaneous excitation waveforms. To obtain the correct level of periodicity, the short-term and the long-term correlations between the instantaneous excitation waveforms can be controlled explicitly. Thus, distortions such as noise, reverberation, and buzziness can be prevented. The coding method is easily combined with existing LP-based speech coders, such as CELP, for unvoiced signals. Excellent voiced speech quality is obtained at rates between 3.0 and 4.0 kb/s.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.242484","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6235","startPage":"386","endPage":"399","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6235/00242484.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Encoding speech using prototype waveforms","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242484/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Encoding speech using prototype waveforms","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4657583","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"1","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Encoding speech using prototype waveforms","sourcePdf":"00242484.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051608S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"83","articleId":"242484","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":242486,"authors":[{"name":"E.

As a special case, these algorithms suggest a potentially interesting modification of Widrow's (1975) least-squares method for noise cancellation, where the reference signal contains a component of the desired signal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6235","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6235/00242486.pdf","doi":"10.1109/89.242486","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.242486","startPage":"405","endPage":"413","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-channel signal separation by decorrelation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242486/","displayDocTitle":"Multi-channel signal separation by decorrelation","isJournal":true,"volume":"1","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4657585","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-channel signal separation by decorrelation","sourcePdf":"00242486.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.050908S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"221","articleId":"242486","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":242487,"authors":[{"name":"Mei-Yuh Hwang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Camegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Mei-Yuh Hwang","id":"37344912600"},{"name":"Xuedong Huang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science, Camegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"lastName":"Xuedong Huang","id":"37281303500"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1063-6676"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2353"}],"articleNumber":"242487","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":68,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":344},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Signal Processing Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/organizations/society/sp/index.html"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Hidden Markov models","Speech recognition","Training data","Context modeling","Iterative algorithms","Stochastic processes","Interpolation","Parameter estimation","Error analysis","Resource management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic signal processing","hidden Markov models","speech analysis and processing","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["shared-distribution hidden Markov model","HMM","speaker-independent continuous speech recognition","phonetics","acoustic similarity","redundant states collapse","word error rate reduction","DARPA Resource Management task","generalized-triphone model"]}],"doi":"10.1109/89.242487","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6235/00242487.pdf","startPage":"414","endPage":"420","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6235","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.242487","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=242487","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Shared-distribution hidden Markov models for speech recognition","abstract":"A shared-distribution hidden Markov model (HMM) is presented for speaker-independent continuous speech recognition.

The method is based on the expectation-maximization algorithm and can be considered as the continuous analog of the Baum-Welch estimation algorithm for hidden Markov models. The algorithm is used for training the parameters of a dynamical system model that is proposed for better representing the spectral dynamics of speech for recognition. It is assumed that the observed feature vectors of a phone segment are the output of a stochastic linear dynamical system, and it is shown how the evolution of the dynamics as a function of the segment length can be modeled using alternative assumptions. A phoneme classification task using the TIMIT database demonstrates that the approach is the first effective use of an explicit model for statistical dependence between frames of speech.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/89.242489","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/89/6235/00242489.pdf","startPage":"431","endPage":"442","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00242489.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/89.242489","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6235","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ML estimation of a stochastic linear system with the EM algorithm and its application to speech recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242489/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"ML estimation of a stochastic linear system with the EM algorithm and its application to speech recognition","volume":"1","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4657588","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ML estimation of a stochastic linear system with the EM algorithm and its application to speech recognition","sourcePdf":"00242489.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05942S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6235","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"89","citationCount":"162","articleId":"242489","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":242490,"authors":[{"name":"L.R.

Word models are constructed from models of subword units called fenones. Fenones represent very short speech events and are obtained automatically through the use of a vector quantizer. The fenonic baseform for a word-i.e., the sequence of fenones used to represent the word-is derived automatically from one or more utterances of that word. Since the word models are all composed from a small inventory of subword models, training for large-vocabulary speech recognition systems can be accomplished with a small training script. A method for combining phonetic and fenonic models is presented. Results of experiments with speaker-dependent and speaker-independent models on several isolated-word recognition tasks are reported.

Using the branch-and-bound technique, a module allocation algorithm (MAA) is proposed to find an optimal allocation that maximizes the probability of meeting task deadlines. To incorporate both timing and logical correctness into module allocation, the probability of meeting task deadlines is used as the objective function. The MAA is then applied to find an optimal allocation of task modules in a distributed system. The timing aspects embedded in the objective function drive the MAA not only to assign task modules to PNs, but also to use a module scheduling algorithm for scheduling all modules assigned to each PN so that all tasks may be completed in time. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed algorithms.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REAL.1992.242668","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6239","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings Real-Time Systems Symposium","pdfPath":"/iel2/447/6239/00242668.pdf","endPage":"155","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Allocation of periodic task modules with precedence and deadline constraints in distributed real-time systems","doi":"10.1109/REAL.1992.242668","startPage":"146","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=242668","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-4 Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"Allocation of periodic task modules with precedence and deadline constraints in distributed real-time systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242668/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4471430","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"2-4 Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Allocation of periodic task modules with precedence and deadline constraints in distributed real-time systems","confLoc":"Phoenix, AZ, USA","sourcePdf":"00242668.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04748S","chronDate":"2-4 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6239","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"447","citationCount":"27","articleId":"242668","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":242671,"authors":[{"name":"J.P.

In the existing architectures, the role of a processor to run as either PE or CU is determined only at design time. It is shown that this fixed assignment results in performance degradations. Furthermore, a single processor-pool MSIMD/MIMD architectural model with dynamic processor assignments is introduced. A cube-based single processor-pool system is presented.

The prototype performs 505 megasynapses (million of additions and multiplications) per second, using 16-b fixed-point weights. It can emulate fully connected instances of the Boltzmann machine containing up to 1438 variables. This specialized hardware only executes the simplest part of the Boltzmann machine algorithm, namely, multiplying matrices of numbers by vectors of bits. The other operations (which are complicated, but only require a modest amount of computation) are performed by the host processor. It is noted that the key point of this work resides in establishing the right design choices. Among these, the most important ones are the rejection of 'neural parallelism', which makes the implementation exact, and the algorithm used to generate random numbers in software, which allows the hardware to be simple. The fact that DECPeRLe-1 makes hardware development cheap and fast was essential in this work.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An exact hardware implementation of the Boltzmann machine","publicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","doi":"10.1109/SPDP.1992.242756","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE Symposium on Parallel and Distributed Processing","pdfPath":"/iel2/448/6240/00242756.pdf","startPage":"107","endPage":"110","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SPDP.1992.242756","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6240","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=242756","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/242756/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1-4 Dec 1992","displayDocTitle":"An exact hardware implementation of the Boltzmann machine","conferenceDate":"1-4 Dec. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4474525","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An exact hardware implementation of the Boltzmann machine","confLoc":"Arlington, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00242756.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033314S","chronDate":"1-4 Dec 1992","isNumber":"6240","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"448","citationCount":"8","articleId":"242756","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":242858,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The question is whether these local criteria in conjunction with a general optimization principle can explain the overall structure of an arterial tree. The authors present a model of an arterial vascular tree which is grown on the computer by successively adding terminal vessel segments. Each new terminal segment is connected to the optimum site within the preexisting tree, and the new bifurcation is optimized geometrically. After each step of adding and optimizing, the whole tree is rescaled to meet invariant boundary conditions of pressure and flow at each terminal site. Thus, local geometric optimization is used to induce simultaneously an optimized global structure. The comparison between the model and real coronary arterial trees shows good agreement regarding structural appearance, morphometric parameters, and pressure profiles.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/10.243413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6267","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.243413","endPage":"491","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6267/00243413.pdf","startPage":"482","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-optimization of vascular trees","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"May  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243413/","displayDocTitle":"Computer-optimization of vascular trees","volume":"40","issue":"5","accessionNumber":"4520700","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","pubMedId":"8225337","publicationDate":"May 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-optimization of vascular trees","sourcePdf":"243413.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039019S","chronDate":"May  1993","isNumber":"6267","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"93","articleId":"243413","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":243431,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The dependence of the codebook density on the data density for different complexity functions is investigated in the limit of asymptotic quantization levels. How different complexity measures influence the efficiency of vector quantizers is studied for the task of image compression. The wavelet coefficients of gray-level images are quantized, and the reconstruction error is measured. The approach establishes a unifying framework for different quantization methods like K-means clustering and its fuzzy version, entropy constrained vector quantization or topological feature maps, and competitive neural networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6268/00243432.pdf","startPage":"1133","endPage":"1145","doi":"10.1109/18.243432","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.243432","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Vector quantization with complexity costs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Vector quantization with complexity costs","publicationDate":"July 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4592666","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Vector quantization with complexity costs","sourcePdf":"00243432.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057658S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"73","articleId":"243432","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":243433,"authors":[{"name":"A.

An important class of multiresolution decompositions are the Laplacian pyramid schemes, in which the resolution is successively halved by recursively low-pass filtering the signal under analysis and decimating it by a factor of two. In general, the principal framework within which multiresolution techniques have been studied and applied is the same as that used in the discrete-time Fourier analysis of sequences of complex numbers. An analogous framework is developed for the multiresolution analysis of finite-length sequences of elements from arbitrary fields. Attention is restricted to sequences of length 2/sup n/, for n a positive integer, so that the resolution may be recursively halved to completion. As in finite-length Fourier analysis, a cyclic group structure of the index set of such sequences is exploited to characterize the transforms of interest for the particular cases of complex and finite fields.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243435/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4592669","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Wavelet transforms associated with finite cyclic groups","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Wavelet transforms associated with finite cyclic groups","sourcePdf":"00243435.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035328S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"56","articleId":"243435","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":243438,"authors":[{"name":"P.

Forney, Jr., on the algebraic structure of convolutional encoders upon which some new results regarding minimal convolutional encoders rest. An example is given of a basic convolutional encoding matrix whose number of abstract states is minimal over all equivalent encoding matrices. However, this encoding matrix can be realized with a minimal number of memory elements neither in controller canonical form nor in observer canonical form. Thus, this encoding matrix is not minimal according to Forney's definition of a minimal encoder. To resolve this difficulty, the following three minimality criteria are introduced: minimal-basic encoding matrix, minimal encoding matrix, and minimal encoder. It is shown that all minimal-basic encoding matrices are minimal and that there exist minimal encoding matrices that are not minimal-basic. Several equivalent conditions are given for an encoding matrix to be minimal. It is proven that the constraint lengths of two equivalent minimal-basic encoding matrices are equal one by one up to a rearrangement. All results are proven using only elementary linear algebra.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Linear algebra","Encoding","Convolutional codes","Polynomials","Information theory","Testing","Councils","Sequential circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["convolutional codes","encoding","linear algebra","matrix algebra"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["linear algebra approach","minimal convolutional encoders","convolutional encoding matrix","abstract states","minimality criteria","minimal-basic encoding matrix","minimal encoding matrix","minimal encoder","constraint lengths"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=243440","doi":"10.1109/18.243440","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6268/00243440.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.243440","startPage":"1219","endPage":"1233","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A linear algebra approach to minimal convolutional encoders","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A linear algebra approach to minimal convolutional encoders","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243440/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4592674","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A linear algebra approach to minimal convolutional encoders","sourcePdf":"00243440.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.021002S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"58","articleId":"243440","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":243441,"authors":[{"name":"A.R.

The first method multiplexes different coded signal constellations, with each coded constellation providing a different level of error protection. In this method, a codeword specifies the multiplexing rule and the choice of the codeword from a fixed codebook is used to convey additional important information. The decoder determines the multiplexing rule before decoding the rest of the data. The second method is based on partitioning a signal constellation into disjoint subsets in which the most important data sequence is encoded, using most of the available redundancy, to specify a sequence of subsets. The partitioning and code construction is done to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance between two different valid subset sequences. This leads to ways of partitioning the signal constellations into subsets. The less important data selects a sequence of signal points to be transmitted from the subsets. A side benefit of the proposed set partitioning procedure is a reduction in the number of nearest neighbors, sometimes even over the uncoded signal constellation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4592675","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Multilevel codes for unequal error protection","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multilevel codes for unequal error protection","sourcePdf":"00243441.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066914S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"126","articleId":"243441","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":243442,"authors":[{"name":"G.W.

The algorithm is similar to the Viterbi algorithm in that it is suitable for situations in which the uncorrupted data string is generated by a known finite-state process, but it is more versatile in that it can correct a much broader class of errors. Of particular importance is the fact that the algorithm corrects common context-sensitive errors, such as symbol changes, transpositions, mergers, splits, insertions, and deletions, which may be assigned different probabilities depending on the context of preceeding and subsequent symbols. As many communication channels can be modeled in this way, this algorithm is a significant extension over the Viterbi algorithm and previous decoding techniques. The notion of channel rules is introduced to provide a framework for the user to specify the channel operation. The algorithm is given in both an off-line form and a recursive form suitable for sequentially presented data streams. In most applications, the recursive form has computational complexity only a constant times that of the Viterbi algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243442/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4592676","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"39","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"Correcting dependent errors in sequences generated by finite-state processes","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Correcting dependent errors in sequences generated by finite-state processes","sourcePdf":"00243442.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038342S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","articleId":"243442","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":243443,"authors":[{"name":"N.

Simple universal sequential schemes are known, under certain conditions, to approach optimality uniformly as fast as n/sup -1/ log n, where n is the sample size. For the case of finite-alphabet observations, the class of schemes that can be implemented by finite-state machines (FSMs) is studied. It is shown that Markovian machines with sufficiently long memory exist, which are asymptotically nearly as good as any given deterministic or randomized FSM for the purpose of sequential decision. For the continuous-valued observation case, a useful class of parametric schemes is discussed with special attention to the recursive least squares algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6268/00243445.pdf","startPage":"1280","endPage":"1292","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/18.243445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.243445","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=243445","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Universal schemes for sequential decision from individual data sequences","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Signal processing algorithms","Information theory","Least squares methods","Recursive estimation","Least squares approximation","Control theory","Statistics","Conferences","Power engineering and energy","Power engineering computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Bayes methods","decision theory","finite state machines","information theory","least squares approximations","Markov processes","sequential machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["RLS algorithm","sequential decision","individual data sequences","additive performance criteria","universal sequential schemes","finite-alphabet observations","finite-state machines","Markovian machines","continuous-valued observation","parametric schemes","recursive least squares algorithm"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243445/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","displayDocTitle":"Universal schemes for sequential decision from individual data sequences","volume":"39","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July 1993","accessionNumber":"4592679","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Universal schemes for sequential decision from individual data sequences","sourcePdf":"00243445.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089677S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"53","articleId":"243445","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":243446,"authors":[{"name":"F.D.

A characterization of uncorrelatedness and wide-sense stationarity in terms of covariance and pseudo-covariance is given. Complex random variables and processes with a vanishing pseudo-covariance are called proper. It is shown that properness is preserved under affine transformations and that the complex-multivariate Gaussian density assumes a natural form only for proper random variables. The maximum-entropy theorem is generalized to the complex-multivariate case. The differential entropy of a complex random vector with a fixed correlation matrix is shown to be maximum if and only if the random vector is proper, Gaussian, and zero-mean. The notion of circular stationarity is introduced. For the class of proper complex random processes, a discrete Fourier transform correspondence is derived relating circular stationarity in the time domain to uncorrelatedness in the frequency domain. An application of the theory is presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243446/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","volume":"39","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4592680","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Proper complex random processes with applications to information theory","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Proper complex random processes with applications to information theory","sourcePdf":"00243446.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.047338S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"615","articleId":"243446","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-25"},{"_id":243449,"authors":[{"name":"G.G.

The major point addressed is the derivation of a statistical prior model that adequately describes such layered media. This problem is of interest in applications in which the data are generally processed in one dimension only. In order to take local interactions into account, a Markovian description is used. The model is derived so as to fulfill a set of constraints that summarize physical and geometrical characteristics of the problem as well as practical requirements. The resulting class of Markov random fields presents a unilateral structure on a nonrectangular lattice and a hierarchical organization which involves a line process. In addition, it is shown to be an extension of one-dimensional models already in use. The properties of the model are investigated, and its practicality is demonstrated by an application to seismic deconvolution.

The algorithm involves projecting the points of the Leech lattice directly onto the codewords of the (6,3,4) quaternary code-the hexacode. Projection on the hexacode induces a partition of the Leech lattice into four cosets of a certain sublattice 24. Such a partition into cosets enables maximum likelihood decoding of the Leech lattice with 3595 real operations in the worst case and only 2955 operations on the average. This is about half the worst case and the average complexity of the best previously known algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00243466.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6268","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel1/18/6268/00243466.pdf","doi":"10.1109/18.243466","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/18.243466","startPage":"1435","endPage":"1444","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum likelihood decoding of the Leech lattice","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243466/","displayDocTitle":"Maximum likelihood decoding of the Leech lattice","isJournal":true,"volume":"39","issue":"4","accessionNumber":"4598772","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"July 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum likelihood decoding of the Leech lattice","sourcePdf":"00243466.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.053504S","chronDate":"Jul 1993","isNumber":"6268","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"28","articleId":"243466","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":243467,"authors":[{"name":"A.V.

The second step is a simple conversion of q-ary symbols to binary strings of the type 00. . .01. The concatenation of these strings satisfies the (d,k)-constraint within the codeword and in concatenation with neighboring words. The length of the codewords is controlled and, if necessary, can be fixed. The rate R/sub 1/ of the overall encoding approaches (2 log/sub 2/ (k-d+1)/(k+d+2) for large codeword lengths. Codes for correction of peak-shift, deletions, and insertions of zeros are presented as well.

It should be understood, though, that some of the attractive features of one are not found in the other. The architecture proposed in this paper is a combination of these architectures, providing some of the desirable properties of both the networks such as admitting many computationally important networks, flexibility in terms of connections per node as well as level of fault-tolerance. Also the network allows a simple VLSI layout, scalability as well as decomposability. Thus, these networks can be a potential candidate for VLSI multiprocessor networks. The proposed network possesses logarithmic diameter, optimal connectivity, and simple routing algorithms amendable to networks with faults. Importantly, in addition to being pancyclic, these hyper-deBruijn networks admit most computationally important subnetworks including rings, multidimensional meshes, complete binary trees, and mesh of trees with perfect dilation. Techniques for optimal one-to-all (OTA) broadcasting in these networks are presented. As an intermediate result, this technique provides the fastest OTA broadcasting in binary deBruijn networks as well. The recent renewed interest in binary deBruijn networks makes this later result valuable.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.243525","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","startPage":"962","endPage":"978","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6271/00243525.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00243525.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.243525","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6271","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The hyper-deBruijn networks: scalable versatile architecture","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture","Computer networks","Very large scale integration","Broadcasting","Hypercubes","Fault tolerance","Scalability","Routing","Multidimensional systems","Binary trees"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerant computing","hypercube networks","parallel architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hyper-deBruijn networks","scalable versatile architecture","fault-tolerance","VLSI layout","decomposability","multiprocessor networks","logarithmic diameter","optimal connectivity","routing algorithms","multidimensional meshes","complete binary trees","optimal one-to-all broadcasting"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"The hyper-deBruijn networks: scalable versatile architecture","volume":"4","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4582746","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243525/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The hyper-deBruijn networks: scalable versatile architecture","sourcePdf":"00243525.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046752S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"55","articleId":"243525","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":243526,"authors":[{"name":"M.H.

Dynamic load balancing (DLB) is essential for the efficient use of highly parallel systems when solving non-uniform problems with unpredictable load estimates. With the evolution of more highly parallel systems, centralized DLB approaches which make use of a high degree of knowledge become less feasible due to the load balancing communication overhead. Five DLB strategies are presented which illustrate the tradeoff between 1) knowledge - the accuracy of each balancing decision, and 2) overhead - the amount of added processing and communication incurred by the balancing process. All five strategies have been implemented on an Inter iPSC/2 hypercube.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243526/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","volume":"4","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4582747","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Strategies for dynamic load balancing on highly parallel computers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Strategies for dynamic load balancing on highly parallel computers","sourcePdf":"00243526.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028702S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6271","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"330","articleId":"243526","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":243565,"authors":[{"name":"C.H.

One technique, called block signature self-checking (BSSC), checks the control flow between program blocks. The other, called error capturing instructions (ECIs), inserts ECIs in the program area, the data area, and the unused area of the memory. To demonstrate these techniques, a program has been developed which modifies the executable code for the MC6809E 8-b microprocessor. The error detection techniques were evaluated using two fault injection techniques: heavy-ion radiation from a californium-252 source and power supply disturbances. Combinations of the two error detection techniques were tested for three different workloads. A combination BSSC, ECIs, and a watchdog timer was also evaluated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Two software techniques for on-line error detection","publicationTitle":"[1992] Digest of Papers.

In a clustered RAID, the G data/parity blocks are distributed over a cluster of C disks, C>G, thus reducing the additional load on each disk due to a single disk failure. The authors present a fast algorithm for distributing parity groups of size G over C disks. They create mappings for each parity group based on almost-random permutations. An analytical model is constructed to predict recovery time and read/write performance. The analysis shows that the clustered RAID is significantly more tolerant of disk failure than the basic RAID scheme.

To maintain high quality, LPI communications in this environment requires a spread spectrum system to use fast acting adaptive power control (APC).

RNNs have the ability to learn dynamical mappings of arbitrary complexity and therefore present a natural choice for implementing equalizers for communication channels. In several cases the nonlinear nature of a communication channel is too severe to ignore, and at the same time no nonlinear channel model can account sufficiently for the nonlinearities that are inherently present in the channel. In those cases a neural network equalizer is preferable over a conventional one. The real-time recurrent learning (RTRL) algorithm is used to train an RNN, and its performance is compared with that of a conventional equalizer based on the constant-modulus algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/243999/","accessionNumber":"4478353","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Using recurrent neural networks for blind equalization of linear and nonlinear communications channels","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using recurrent neural networks for blind equalization of linear and nonlinear communications channels","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00243999.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.050777S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"638","citationCount":"4","articleId":"243999","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":244000,"authors":[{"name":"G.

It is independent of the particular network topology, which guarantees robustness in the face of topology changes and makes the result especially suitable for mobile CDMA packet radio networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1992.244002","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 92 Conference Record","startPage":"769","endPage":"773 vol.2","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 92 Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel2/638/6278/00244002.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1992.244002","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nearly optimum scheduling in mobile CDMA packet radio networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Intelligent networks","Multiaccess communication","Packet radio networks","Time division multiple access","Processor scheduling","Narrowband","Spread spectrum communication","Network topology","Radio networks","Computer networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","mobile radio systems","packet radio networks","scheduling","time division multiple access"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile packet radio networks","optimum scheduling","modulo hunter algorithm","CDMA","code division multiple access","TDMA","time division multiple access","slot allocation","multiple reception capacity","network topology"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Nearly optimum scheduling in mobile CDMA packet radio networks","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4478350","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244002/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nearly optimum scheduling in mobile CDMA packet radio networks","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00244002.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039714S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"638","citationCount":"3","articleId":"244002","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":244007,"authors":[{"name":"Y.T.

The conclusion is that scheme A is better at low offsets, up to about a third of the bin width, while scheme B is better at higher offsets.

Optimality is defined as the maximum least cost incurred by a jammer to cause a decoding error (or failure). The design of the decoders or demodulators is determined by a set of thresholds, each of which determines an erasure region. It is demonstrated that the formulation considered here is solvable for many channels including the simple M-ary input-output channel with the Hamming distance as the cost function, the additive channel where the cost function corresponds to Euclidean distance, and a noncoherent channel with ratio-threshold-like decision rules and difference metric decision rules.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1992.244009","doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1992.244009","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 92 Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel2/638/6278/00244009.pdf","startPage":"594","endPage":"598 vol.2","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 92 Conference Record","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00244009.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6278","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Parallel decoding for channels with jamming","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Parallel decoding for channels with jamming","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244009/","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4478343","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Parallel decoding for channels with jamming","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00244009.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.03267S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"638","citationCount":"2","articleId":"244009","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":244011,"authors":[{"name":"D.

The model determines the amount of bit error rate (BER) performance degradation caused by a bursty (e.g., pulsed RF interference) noise environment when interleaving is not used. It uses importance sampling to determine low BERs for a wide range of noise environments. It is faster than a conventional simulation because the required run time is independent of the BER. The model increases the simulation efficiency by biasing the burst error statistics so that more codeword errors occur and adjusts for this by using a weighting function whose value is calculated through the use of a Markov chain to represent the burst error statistics.

Low-complexity coherent and differentially coherent multiuser detectors are analyzed for this scenario. The receivers consist of a bank of matched filters followed by a multipath decorrelating detector, appropriate multipath diversity combining, and demodulation. The performance of the derived detectors is expressed by the single-user error rate. The conventional single-user RAKE receiver suffers from near-far effects in the multiuser scenario, due to the fading nature of the channel. This results in an error probability floor for high signal-to-noise ratios and limits the multiple-access capability of the system.

The nonlinear characteristics of the bandpass limiter result in the generation of intermodulation products which become narrowband signals after the despreading process in the spread spectrum receiver. These intermodulation products and the cochannel interference affect system performance. The assumptions made in deriving the theoretical performance of the system were checked by simulating the entire system using the Block Oriented Systems Simulator (BOSS) software package. The results of the simulation show good agreement with the theoretical calculations, within 1 to 2 dB in signal-to-noise ratio.

Conventional importance sampling provides improvement in the simulation times for linear systems that contain little or no memory. Improved importance sampling reduces the simulation time required independently of memory length. The bit-error-rate (BER) performance of a baseband communication system is analyzed using these new blocks in order to quantify the improvement in simulation time using importance sampling as opposed to direct Monte-Carlo simulation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Monte Carlo methods","Signal processing","Computational Intelligence Society","Noise generators","Transmitters","Integral equations","Gaussian noise","Noise reduction","Baseband","Digital communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data communication systems","digital simulation","signal processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["importance sampling techniques","Signal Processing WorkSystem","simulation tool","linear systems","bit-error-rate","baseband communication system"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MILCOM.1992.244139","publicationTitle":"MILCOM 92 Conference Record","displayPublicationTitle":"MILCOM 92 Conference Record","pdfPath":"/iel2/638/6278/00244139.pdf","startPage":"701","endPage":"706 vol.2","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6278","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MILCOM.1992.244139","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation of importance sampling techniques using the Signal Processing WorkSystem (SPW)","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=244139","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Implementation of importance sampling techniques using the Signal Processing WorkSystem (SPW)","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244139/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4471291","conferenceDate":"11-14 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation of importance sampling techniques using the Signal Processing WorkSystem (SPW)","confLoc":"San Diego, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00244139.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.027941S","chronDate":"11-14 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6278","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"638","articleId":"244139","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-28"},{"_id":244141,"authors":[{"name":"K.

However, when raised cosine pulses are used, it is found that maintaining orthogonality between users' signals is no longer optimal and the total capacity of the CDMA channel is larger than that of the FDMA channel. The maximum numbers of users supported by CDMA and FDMA are compared, assuming that each user has the same available power and demands the same capacity.

It is shown that the conversion of a continuous reference signal into a discrete switching sequence normally creates a modulation error at dynamic operation. This error is detected in an optical synchronous modulator using the steady-state current trajectory as a reference track in the transient state. A tracking controller eliminates the tracking error by modifying the switching pattern in real time. A parameter identification scheme enables the identification of the instantaneous fundamental current and the implementation of fast current regulators. Oscillograms from a 30-kW model drive demonstrate the high quality in forms of dynamic performance and minimum harmonic distortion obtained with a three-level inverter at only 200 Hz switching frequency.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1992.244276","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1992 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1992 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/650/6279/00244276.pdf","startPage":"331","endPage":"338 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1992.244276","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6279","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The trajectory tracking approach-a new method for minimum distortion PWM in dynamic high-power drives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=244276","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Oct. 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244276/","displayDocTitle":"The trajectory tracking approach-a new method for minimum distortion PWM in dynamic high-power drives","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4478246","conferenceDate":"4-9 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The trajectory tracking approach-a new method for minimum distortion PWM in dynamic high-power drives","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00244276.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.021811S","chronDate":"4-9 Oct. 1992","isNumber":"6279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"650","citationCount":"26","articleId":"244276","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":244278,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

The objective is to track and extract the maximum available solar power from the PV array under varying solar insolation levels. To achieve this the power error and the rate of change of this error are used as input signals to the fuzzy rule-based controller and its output signal is used to control the PWM inverter. The input error signals are fuzzified and expressed as linguistic labels characterized by their membership grades. Using a fuzzy relation matrix, a set of 49 rules find fuzzy logic operations, the controller output is obtained. The fuzzy controller output expressed in linguistic labels is defuzzified to obtain the actual analog signal to control the PWM inverter.

The controller is designed by the pole placement technique of multivariable system regulation theory. Feedforward control is included in the control laws to improve transient responses. For the full state feedback control, the rotor flux is estimated with a reduced-order state observer. A good steady-state performance is obtained by means of an integral compensation, and fast transient response is also feasible since the required voltage is directly calculated from the feedforward control. Space voltage vector pulse width modulation is adopted as a switching strategy. A variable modulation scheme is presented which is changed from three-phase to two-phase modulation in the high modulation range, which gives lower current ripple over the whole operating range.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Regulators","State feedback","Thyristors","Space vector pulse width modulation","Pulse width modulation","Current control","Induction motors","Pulse width modulation inverters","Control systems","MIMO"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["compensation","control system synthesis","electric current control","electric drives","feedback","induction motors","invertors","machine control","magnetic flux","multivariable control systems","poles and zeros","rotors","state estimation","switching","thyristor applications","transient response","State estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["machine control","electric current control","field oriented control","control system synthesis","feedforward control","state estimation","performance","induction motor drive","gate turn-off thyristor","GTO","inverter","multivariable state feedback control","integrator","pole placement technique","transient responses","feedback","rotor flux","reduced-order state observer","compensation","switching","three-phase","two-phase","current ripple"]}],"previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00244349.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1992.244349","startPage":"538","endPage":"544 vol.1","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1992 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1992 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/650/6279/00244349.pdf","doi":"10.1109/IAS.1992.244349","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High performance current regulator for a field-oriented controlled induction motor drive","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"High performance current regulator for a field-oriented controlled induction motor drive","accessionNumber":"4474349","publicationDate":"1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"4-9 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244349/","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Oct 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High performance current regulator for a field-oriented controlled induction motor drive","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00244349.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.029543S","chronDate":"4-9 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"650","citationCount":"18","articleId":"244349","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":244351,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Experimental verification is carried out on a prototype rolling mill mini-model system. The experimental drive system has a three-mass-model structure (motor-gear-load) connected by low stiffness shafts. The mechanical resonances and the inertia ratios between the motor, gear, and load are comparable to those of an actual rolling mill system (resonant frequencies are at 17.4 Hz and 51.32 Hz).

The characteristics of regular direct-direct (DD) and inverted direct-inverse (DI) sequencing strategies are investigated both analytically and experimentally. The two strategies are compared with respect to the current ripple, the current spectrum, and the commutation losses. It was found that DD sequence offers superior performance for the majority of loads, such as induction motor drives. For other types of inverter loads, with small or leading power factors, the optimal modulation strategy consists in using the DI sequence when the output voltage is low and the DD sequence if the modulation index is between m(M) and 1. For best results, the switch-over point M has to be evaluated as a function of load and inverter design.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Space vector pulse width modulation","Voltage control","Pulse width modulation inverters","Commutation","Digital modulation","Zero voltage switching","Pulse width modulation","Optimization methods","Reactive power","Switching loss"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric drives","invertors","pulse width modulation","switching","voltage control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["direct-direct sequencing","PWM voltage control","inverted direct-inverse sequencing","variable frequency AC drives","optimized switching","space vector modulation","current ripple","current spectrum","commutation losses","induction motor drives","inverter loads","power factors","modulation index","inverter design"]}],"doi":"10.1109/IAS.1992.244434","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00244434.png","publicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1992 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","displayPublicationTitle":"Conference Record of the 1992 IEEE Industry Applications Society Annual Meeting","pdfPath":"/iel2/650/6279/00244434.pdf","startPage":"1025","endPage":"1033 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6279","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IAS.1992.244434","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Space-vector PWM voltage control with optimized switching strategy","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=244434","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Space-vector PWM voltage control with optimized switching strategy","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244434/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4471215","conferenceDate":"4-9 Oct. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-9 Oct 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Space-vector PWM voltage control with optimized switching strategy","confLoc":"Houston, TX, USA","sourcePdf":"00244434.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.034027S","chronDate":"4-9 Oct 1992","isNumber":"6279","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"650","citationCount":"63","articleId":"244434","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":244436,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Two of the methods utilize solid tube windings; the first employs concentric, series connected tubes, and the second uses a single tube split into uniformly spaced arc segments. The concentric tube winding allows use of additional winding material and, if the tube thicknesses are chosen close to the optimal values, results in the lowest AC resistance increases and ultimately exceeds that of the split tube winding. The split tube winding with n turns results in an AC resistance which is n/sup 2/ times the resistance of the original unsplit tube. Unlike the concentric tube winding, the frequency dependence of the resistance is identical to the single tube case which can be advantageous when the current has a large harmonic content. The third technique utilizes litz wire for the outer as well as the inner winding.

The exact expressions converge rapidly in the induction and near-field regions of the antenna. They are completely general and independent of the usual restrictions involving the wavelength, field point distance, dipole radius and length. The properties of these expressions allow them to be readily used for the efficient as well as accurate computational modeling of cylindrical wire antennas. An exact expression for the cylindrical wire kernel which is analytically as well as numerically convenient to work with is presented. It is demonstrated that the integral of the kernel can be expressed in terms of a series which involves a generalized exponential integral and higher-order associated integrals. Several methods for evaluating the generalized exponential integral are discussed, including some useful asymptotic expansions. A numerically stable forward recurrence relation for the higher-order associated integrals is also presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244641/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4587038","volume":"41","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"An exact formulation for the vector potential of a cylindrical antenna with uniformly distributed current and arbitrary radius","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An exact formulation for the vector potential of a cylindrical antenna with uniformly distributed current and arbitrary radius","sourcePdf":"00244641.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028937S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"56","articleId":"244641","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":244642,"authors":[{"name":"P.-S.

The system is analyzed by forward ray tracing from each individual feed horn via the three reflectors to the aperture. The radiation pattern is determined by aperture integration. The analysis method is very time efficient compared with physical optics (PO) integration, the latter being unusable at high frequencies because the computer time increases by a factor proportional to the frequency to the power 4. Results obtained by the ray tracing method and PO integration are in very good agreement at frequencies low enough to be used for PO calculations. A special algorithm is developed to determine the squint and directivity of an individual main beam without computing the radiation pattern. This makes it possible to use the program very efficiently when searching for optimum cluster feed geometries. The computer programs are used to design a seven-element cluster feed for the Arecibo trireflector system.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.244642","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6281/00244642.pdf","startPage":"1019","endPage":"1025","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.244642","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of a cluster feed for the Arecibo trireflector system using forward ray tracing and aperture integration","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=244642","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244642/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of a cluster feed for the Arecibo trireflector system using forward ray tracing and aperture integration","volume":"41","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4587039","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of a cluster feed for the Arecibo trireflector system using forward ray tracing and aperture integration","sourcePdf":"00244642.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.03695S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"14","articleId":"244642","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":244643,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

Both of the designs are based on the principle that a ring of magnetic current in a substrate (which models the patches) will not excite the dominant TM/sub 0/ surface wave if the radius of the ring is a particular critical value. Numerical results for radiation efficiency and radiated field strength from a ring of magnetic current are shown to verify this basic design principle. The proposed patch designs are chosen to have a radius equal to this critical value, while maintaining resonance at the design frequency. The designs excite very little surface-wave power, and thus have smoother radiation patterns when mounted on finite-size ground planes, due to reduced surface-wave diffraction. They also have reduced mutual coupling, due to the reduced surface-wave excitation. Measured results for radiation patterns and field strength within the substrate are presented to verify the theoretical concepts.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6281/00244643.pdf","startPage":"1026","endPage":"1037","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.244643","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.244643","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6281","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=244643","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Microstrip patch designs that do not excite surface waves","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface waves","Microstrip antennas","Magnetic resonance","Antenna radiation patterns","Diffraction","Mutual coupling","Frequency","Antenna measurements","Magnetic field measurement","Dielectric substrates"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","microstrip antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["numerical results","microstrip antennas","cored patch design","annular ring design","circular microstrip patch design","magnetic current","TM/sub 0/ surface wave","radiation efficiency","radiated field strength","radiation patterns","finite-size ground planes","surface-wave diffraction","mutual coupling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244643/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Microstrip patch designs that do not excite surface waves","volume":"41","issue":"8","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4587040","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Microstrip patch designs that do not excite surface waves","sourcePdf":"00244643.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.027871S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6281","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"197","articleId":"244643","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":244645,"authors":[{"name":"L.

The data to be clustered are represented by an undirected adjacency graph G with arc capacities assigned to reflect the similarity between the linked vertices. Clustering is achieved by removing arcs of G to form mutually exclusive subgraphs such that the largest inter-subgraph maximum flow is minimized. For graphs of moderate size ( approximately 2000 vertices), the optimal solution is obtained through partitioning a flow and cut equivalent tree of G, which can be efficiently constructed using the Gomory-Hu algorithm (1961). However for larger graphs this approach is impractical. New theorems for subgraph condensation are derived and are then used to develop a fast algorithm which hierarchically constructs and partitions a partially equivalent tree of much reduced size. This algorithm results in an optimal solution equivalent to that obtained by partitioning the complete equivalent tree and is able to handle very large graphs with several hundred thousand vertices. The new clustering algorithm is applied to the image segmentation problem. The segmentation is achieved by effectively searching for closed contours of edge elements (equivalent to minimum cuts in G), which consist mostly of strong edges, while rejecting contours containing isolated strong edges. This method is able to accurately locate region boundaries and at the same time guarantees the formation of closed edge contours.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.244673","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.244673","endPage":"1113","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00244673.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6282/00244673.pdf","startPage":"1101","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An optimal graph theoretic approach to data clustering: theory and its application to image segmentation","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244673/","displayDocTitle":"An optimal graph theoretic approach to data clustering: theory and its application to image segmentation","volume":"15","issue":"11","accessionNumber":"4580744","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An optimal graph theoretic approach to data clustering: theory and its application to image segmentation","sourcePdf":"00244673.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032677S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"668","articleId":"244673","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-14"},{"_id":244675,"authors":[{"name":"L.D.

A balloon model was introduced by Cohen (1991) as a way to generalize and solve some of the problems encountered with the original method. A 3-D generalization of the balloon model as a 3-D deformable surface, which evolves in 3-D images, is presented. It is deformed under the action of internal and external forces attracting the surface toward detected edgels by means of an attraction potential. We also show properties of energy-minimizing surfaces concerning their relationship with 3-D edge points. To solve the minimization problem for a surface, two simplified approaches are shown first, defining a 3-D surface as a series of 2-D planar curves. Then, after comparing finite-element method and finite-difference method in the 2-D problem, we solve the 3-D model using the finite-element method yielding greater stability and faster convergence.

The most unique phenotypic feature visible in a person's face is the detailed texture of each eye's iris. The visible texture of a person's iris in a real-time video image is encoded into a compact sequence of multi-scale quadrature 2-D Gabor wavelet coefficients, whose most-significant bits comprise a 256-byte \"iris code\". Statistical decision theory generates identification decisions from Exclusive-OR comparisons of complete iris codes at the rate of 4000 per second, including calculation of decision confidence levels. The distributions observed empirically in such comparisons imply a theoretical \"cross-over\" error rate of one in 131000 when a decision criterion is adopted that would equalize the false accept and false reject error rates. In the typical recognition case, given the mean observed degree of iris code agreement, the decision confidence levels correspond formally to a conditional false accept probability of one in about 10/sup 31/.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6282/00244676.pdf","startPage":"1148","endPage":"1161","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High confidence visual recognition of persons by a test of statistical independence","doi":"10.1109/34.244676","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00244676.png","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.244676","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=244676","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"High confidence visual recognition of persons by a test of statistical independence","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4580747","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"15","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High confidence visual recognition of persons by a test of statistical independence","sourcePdf":"00244676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029108S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"2075","articleId":"244676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-20"},{"_id":244677,"authors":[{"name":"L.

This paper describes the document spectrum (or docstrum), which is a method for structural page layout analysis based on bottom-up, nearest-neighbor clustering of page components. The method yields an accurate measure of skew, within-line, and between-line spacings and locates text lines and text blocks. It is advantageous over many other methods in three main ways: independence from skew angle, independence from different text spacings, and the ability to process local regions of different text orientations within the same image. Results of the method shown for several different page formats and for randomly oriented subpages on the same image illustrate the versatility of the method. We also discuss the differences, advantages, and disadvantages of the docstrum with respect to other lay-out methods.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/34.244677","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence","pdfPath":"/iel1/34/6282/00244677.pdf","startPage":"1162","endPage":"1173","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/34.244677","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6282","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The document spectrum for page layout analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=244677","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244677/","displayDocTitle":"The document spectrum for page layout analysis","volume":"15","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4580748","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The document spectrum for page layout analysis","sourcePdf":"00244677.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.073906S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"408","articleId":"244677","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":244679,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The performance of wavelet packet spaces are measured in terms of sensitivity and selectivity for the classification of twenty-five natural textures. Both energy and entropy metrics were computed for each wavelet packet and incorporated into distinct scale space representations, where each wavelet packet (channel) reflected a specific scale and orientation sensitivity. Wavelet packet representations for twenty-five natural textures were classified without error by a simple two-layer network classifier. An analyzing function of large regularity (D/sub 20/) was shown to be slightly more efficient in representation and discrimination than a similar function with fewer vanishing moments (D/sub 6/) In addition, energy representations computed from the standard wavelet decomposition alone (17 features) provided classification without error for the twenty-five textures included in our study. The reliability exhibited by texture signatures based on wavelet packets analysis suggest that the multiresolution properties of such transforms are beneficial for accomplishing segmentation, classification and subtle discrimination of texture.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244679/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4580750","volume":"15","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Texture classification by wavelet packet signatures","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Texture classification by wavelet packet signatures","sourcePdf":"00244679.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040581S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6282","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"34","citationCount":"616","articleId":"244679","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":244713,"authors":[{"name":"T.S.

Here, an approach, called the FDTD-update algorithm, that can substantially improve the convergence properties of the FDTD method when used to compute the response of resonant type structures a single frequency at a time is described. The filtering behavior of the algorithm is demonstrated by considering the problem of coupling into a cavity. Application to other problems is illustrated by solving the microstrip patch antenna configuration, for which the update algorithm is shown to enhance the accuracy of the results.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm for efficient field computation in resonator narrow-band structures","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","doi":"10.1109/75.244864","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/6289/00244864.pdf","startPage":"316","endPage":"318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.244864","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=244864","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244864/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"A new finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm for efficient field computation in resonator narrow-band structures","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"3","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4544945","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm for efficient field computation in resonator narrow-band structures","sourcePdf":"00244864.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054408S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"9","articleId":"244864","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":244866,"authors":[{"name":"J.A.

The calculated return loss agrees very well with data obtained using other techniques which validates the application of the FDTD method for this problem.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/75.244868","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","startPage":"327","endPage":"329","publicationTitle":"IEEE Microwave and Guided Wave Letters","pdfPath":"/iel4/75/6289/00244868.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/75.244868","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6289","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of the transition from rectangular waveguide to shielded dielectric image guide using the finite-difference time-domain method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image analysis","Rectangular waveguides","Waveguide transitions","Finite difference methods","Time domain analysis","Frequency","Dielectric losses","Reflection","Dielectric loss measurement","Millimeter wave circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dielectric waveguides","finite difference time-domain analysis","losses","rectangular waveguides","waveguide theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["waveguide transition","rectangular waveguide","shielded dielectric image guide","finite-difference time-domain method","three dimensional dielectric waveguide discontinuities","return loss","FDTD method"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of the transition from rectangular waveguide to shielded dielectric image guide using the finite-difference time-domain method","volume":"3","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4544949","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/244868/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of the transition from rectangular waveguide to shielded dielectric image guide using the finite-difference time-domain method","sourcePdf":"00244868.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043246S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6289","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"75","citationCount":"16","articleId":"244868","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":244869,"authors":[{"name":"N.J.

Such coded waveforms are detected by appropriately matched filtering of the in-phase and the quadrature samples derived from the received signal. Complementary codes have generated such interest in the area of high-resolution radar signal design. There are, however, no published results to judge the robustness of this coding scheme in the presence of quadrature channel imbalance. Monte Carlo simulation results are presented to fill this gap. It is concluded from the results that although the degradation in the case of complementary codes increases more rapidly than for Frank codes, complementary-coded waveforms have better overall performance than Frank-coded waveforms in the presence of sampling errors.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6292","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1992.245081","publicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/652/6292/00245081.pdf","startPage":"528","endPage":"532","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1992.245081","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Effects of processing errors in the quadrature sampling of complementary coded radar signals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Effects of processing errors in the quadrature sampling of complementary coded radar signals","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4493956","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245081/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Effects of processing errors in the quadrature sampling of complementary coded radar signals","confLoc":"Metropolitan NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00245081.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.031325S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"6292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"652","articleId":"245081","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":245086,"authors":[{"name":"S.L.

As an extension of previous work (see IEEE Trans. Instr. and Meas., vol.40, pp.820-825, 1991) the authors demonstrate the use of a feedforward backpropagation error correction neural network for the filtering of absorption spectra exhibiting the effects of bandlimited Gaussian noise. The noise is bandlimited to the same spectral region as the information bearing signal. The neural network is trained by using synthesized data sets as in the earlier work. The additive noise is generated by sampling a Gaussian distribution of random numbers such that the synthesized noise sequence added to the synthetic spectrum has a variance of 1. The noise sequence of Gaussian random deviates is further bandlimited to the Nyquist frequency dictated by the implied sampling rate.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1992.245086","startPage":"508","endPage":"511","publicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1992.245086","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6292","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/652/6292/00245086.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive filtering for bandlimited noise using an error backpropagation neural network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245086/","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive filtering for bandlimited noise using an error backpropagation neural network","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4493951","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive filtering for bandlimited noise using an error backpropagation neural network","confLoc":"Metropolitan NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00245086.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039808S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"6292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"652","citationCount":"1","articleId":"245086","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":245121,"authors":[{"name":"O.M.

These analyses normally apply a window to the data to alleviate the effects of leakage. It is shown how windows modify the magnitude of a discrete Fourier transform and the level of a power spectral density computed by Welch's method. For white noise, the magnitude of the discrete Fourier transform at a fixed frequency has a Rayleigh probability distribution. For sine waves with an integral number of cycles and quantization noise, the theoretical values of the amplitude of the discrete Fourier transform and power spectral density are calculated. It is demonstrated that the signal-to-noise ratio in a single discrete Fourier transform or power spectral density frequency bin is related to the normal time-domain definition of the signal-to-noise ratio. The answer depends on the discrete Fourier transform length, the window type and the function averaged.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IMTC.1992.245121","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IMTC.1992.245121","startPage":"339","endPage":"344","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/652/6292/00245121.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1992] Conference Record IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6292","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Windows modify the amplitude of frequency domain functions","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Windows modify the amplitude of frequency domain functions","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4493916","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245121/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Windows modify the amplitude of frequency domain functions","confLoc":"Metropolitan NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00245121.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04569S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"6292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"652","citationCount":"3","articleId":"245121","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":245130,"authors":[{"name":"G.

The parameters of a single-band passband filter are extracted from the parameters of a normalized lowpass digital FIR filter using a bilinear transformation. The stopbands of the low-pass digital filter are designed to limit the maximum response from a strong sinusoid, and also to minimize the total energy from the wideband background noise. The parameters of the filter are programmed to detect each frequency band sequentially. The digital filter design is used to shunt the white noise generated by the thermal noise of a 150-W, 100-900-MHz Class A amplifier. The amplifier is fed from five different sensors. In this simulation, the thermal noise amplitude pulses in the frequency range of the amplifier is reduced by about 40 dB.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"12-14 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245146/","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4493891","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"12-14 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Design of programmable FIR digital filter to optimize the detection of signals embedded in white noise","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Design of programmable FIR digital filter to optimize the detection of signals embedded in white noise","confLoc":"Metropolitan NY, USA","sourcePdf":"00245146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054796S","chronDate":"12-14 May 1992","isNumber":"6292","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"652","articleId":"245146","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":245172,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

One is the determination of optimal torque trajectory. Classical solutions of this problem suffer from strongly nonmonotonic torque trajectory, resulting from the difficulty of formulating the monotonicity requirement in the classical quadratic objective function form. A model-based neural-network trainable controller has been applied to this problem. In contrast to previous neural-network approaches, it fully exploits the available information about the plant. By its capability of using an arbitrary nonlinear differentiable control objective function (as well as an arbitrary nonlinear differentiable plant), it allows a direct formulation of the torque monotonicity requirement. The development time for the controller has been only two days. No control engineering competence has been required-the design procedure is very general and automatic.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245249","startPage":"1042","endPage":"1045 vol.2","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245249.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245249","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Neural-network-based car drive train control","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Torque control","Automatic control","Drives","Velocity control","Strain control","Optimal control","Neural networks","Control engineering","Algorithm design and analysis","Automobiles"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive control","automotive electronics","feedforward neural nets","model-based reasoning","torque control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["drive train string optimisation","car drive train control","comfort requirements","optimal torque trajectory","monotonicity requirement","model-based neural-network trainable controller","arbitrary nonlinear differentiable control objective function","arbitrary nonlinear differentiable plant"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245249/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Neural-network-based car drive train control","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","accessionNumber":"4377315","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Neural-network-based car drive train control","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245249.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.04184S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"3","articleId":"245249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":245250,"authors":[{"name":"H.

A promising theoretical method to accurately predict these channel characteristics in microcells is presented. The method uses modified geometrical optics to evaluate average path loss and delay spread. Quantitative building data, such as location, height, and electrical properties, are used to determine the individual multipath component amplitudes and delays. Preliminary verification of the technique against measured data has been conducted. The results illustrate that accurate path loss prediction is possible, with predicted values being within 5 dB of the measured values. As a result of this study, a computer program is being developed to automate the prediction process. The technical issues required for automated propagation prediction are presented. The ray optics model, computer ray tracing techniques, and building data requirements are also described.

Radio channels are viewed in the same order at any base station, and the first channel that satisfies a carrier-to-interference ratio (CIR) threshold is allocated. ARP easily achieves reuse partitioning, in which channels higher in the order are reused at shorter distance by mobile stations from which stronger signal levels are received. An efficient frequency reuse pattern helps ARP to improve traffic handling capacity while avoiding interference. Performance was evaluated by means of computer simulation in which a system accommodating portable units with 70 channels is assumed. Compared with random channel allocation, ARP doubles traffic handling capacity and decreases the probability of interference by 1/4. Actual transmitter power control is shown to improve capacity by 9%. ARP improves traffic handling capacity at the cost of CIR margin in each channel. This can create problems for mobile stations, such as car-mounted units, which suffer rapid fluctuation in signal levels.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Autonomous reuse partitioning in cellular systems","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245308","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245308.pdf","startPage":"782","endPage":"785 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245308","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245308","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245308/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Autonomous reuse partitioning in cellular systems","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4372651","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Autonomous reuse partitioning in cellular systems","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245308.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.033424S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"61","articleId":"245308","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":245312,"authors":[{"name":"Y.

A plausible explanation for the improvement is provided, and the computational requirements of this approach are compared with those of conventional adaptation methods. Those requirements can be minimized by taking advantage of the structure of the DFE coefficient equations. The complexity is compared with that of a conventional adaptive DFE.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245324.pdf","startPage":"600","endPage":"603 vol.2","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245324","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245324","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245324","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Equations","Delay","Land mobile radio","Adaptive equalizers","Nonlinear filters","Filtering","Information systems","Laboratories","Computational modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","equalisers","mobile radio systems","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonrecursive adaptive DFE","performance","complexity","channel estimate-based equalizer adaptation","terrestrial mobile radio channels","initialization","tracking","fractionally spaced decision feedback equalizer","computational requirements","DFE coefficient equations"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245324/","displayDocTitle":"Nonrecursive adaptive decision-feedback equalization from channel estimates","accessionNumber":"4372635","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonrecursive adaptive decision-feedback equalization from channel estimates","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245324.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061916S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"17","articleId":"245324","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":245326,"authors":[{"name":"S.

By simply measuring a difference of absolute values of I-channel and Q-channel detector outputs, multipath delay spread is shown to be estimated. The method is, then, shown to be applicable to the monitoring of carrier to cochannel interference ratio, an important parameter for a cellular system. Although it is difficult to monitor them accurately when both multipath delay spread and cochannel interference exist, it is shown that the measured output is a good measure of bit-error-rate performance, and thus might be useful as a criterion for decision making in intracell handoff, for instance.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"In-service monitoring of multipath delay-spread and C/I for QPSK signal","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245326","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245326.pdf","startPage":"592","endPage":"595 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245326","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245326","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245326/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"In-service monitoring of multipath delay-spread and C/I for QPSK signal","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4372633","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"In-service monitoring of multipath delay-spread and C/I for QPSK signal","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245326.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036561S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"6","articleId":"245326","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":245327,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Two line-of-sight links were used with three different types of antennas to determine best polarizations and pointing angles. Measurements show multipath is most severe when antennas of different polarizations are used on each end of the link. Minimum delay spreads are encountered when antennas of the same polarization are used and pointed directly toward each other. As long as polarizations are matched on each side of the link, polarization does not have significant impact on delay spread or path loss. However, circularly polarized helical antennas offer multipath reduction over a wide range of pointing angles. This suggests that on point-to-point cross-campus links where a single antenna is desired to serve a broad coverage area, circular polarization could be used in lieu of channel equalization to improve bit error rates in high-speed data networks.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245335","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245335.pdf","startPage":"550","endPage":"553 vol.1","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245335","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The effects of antenna gains and polarization on multipath delay spread and path loss at 918 MHz on cross-campus radio links","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"The effects of antenna gains and polarization on multipath delay spread and path loss at 918 MHz on cross-campus radio links","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4372624","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245335/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The effects of antenna gains and polarization on multipath delay spread and path loss at 918 MHz on cross-campus radio links","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245335.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.032172S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"6","articleId":"245335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":245342,"authors":[{"name":"P.F.

One feature of the system is the inclusion of a pilot signal in the forward (base-station-to-mobile) link so as to provide a coherent reference to mobile stations. In the reverse link, however, no pilot is used for power efficiency considerations; thus, a noncoherent reception is used for this direction. The objective is to present a receiver structure that may be used in the reverse link and to analyze its performance in terms of the error probability. Assuming that the reverse link uses a noncoherent M-ary orthogonal modulation, the symbol error probability is derived analytically. In addition, the validity of the analysis results is demonstrated by computer simulations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245351","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245351.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245351","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","startPage":"482","endPage":"485 vol.1","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the error probability of a DS/SSMA system with a noncoherent M-ary orthogonal modulation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245351","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the error probability of a DS/SSMA system with a noncoherent M-ary orthogonal modulation","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245351/","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4372608","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the error probability of a DS/SSMA system with a noncoherent M-ary orthogonal modulation","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245351.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044982S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"23","articleId":"245351","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":245355,"authors":[{"name":"B.

In large cities, small cells can be achieved by placing base station antennas at approximately street level, using the surrounding buildings as propagation obstacles.

A simple model of a large city consisting of square blocks with streets in between (Manhattan model) is used. Efficient strategies for street microcells are suggested.

The hopping sequences are selected such that all users of each cell are using mutually orthogonal codes, and intercell correlation of hopping sequences is minimal. FEC and interleaving are used to mitigate the remaining interference. It is shown that with proper selection of system parameters, FH-CDMA enjoys the advantages so far claimed by DS-CDMA, i.e. FH-CDMA capacity benefits from interference averaging and can take advantage of the duty cycle associated with voice activity. It also yields a sectorization capability and one-cell frequency reuse pattern. Moreover, due to the orthogonal operation, the interference from cell co-users is eliminated. Since this is the major source of interference in nonorthogonal systems like DS-CDMA, FH-CDMA yields higher capacity capabilities (35 times AMPS). Other advantages of FH-CDMA with its implementation as a cellular system are discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245367.pdf","startPage":"400","endPage":"404 vol.1","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245367","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245367","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245367","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Frequency hopping CDMA for future cellular radio","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Multiaccess communication","Land mobile radio cellular systems","Frequency division multiaccess","Time division multiple access","Spread spectrum communication","Interleaved codes","Interference elimination","Power control","Digital communication","Europe"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","channel capacity","code division multiple access","convolutional codes","error correction codes","frequency agility","spread spectrum communication"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["spread spectrum techniques","convolutional coding","cellular radio","code-division multiple access","slow frequency hopping","mutually orthogonal codes","FEC","interleaving","FH-CDMA","capacity","interference averaging","sectorization capability","one-cell frequency reuse pattern"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245367/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"Frequency hopping CDMA for future cellular radio","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4372590","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Frequency hopping CDMA for future cellular radio","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245367.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.036427S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"26","articleId":"245367","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":245368,"authors":[{"name":"T.

The channel cutoff rate of an interference-limited coded FFH/CDMA channel with a hexagonal cell layout is analyzed for both synchronous and asynchronous cases. The theoretical capacity limit is calculated from the channel cutoff rate. The optimal rate that maximized the user capacity is then determined.

A decision feedback equalizer (DFE) with a recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm is used as the equalization scheme. The results show that adaptive equalization can significantly improve the bit-error-rate (BER) of a mobile system if the channel does not change too rapidly. The simulation shows that in a two-ray Rayleigh fading channel, if the delay of the second ray is too small, then adaptive equalization will degrade the BER performance. The value of the delay at which the adaptive equalizer can improve the BER depends on the normalized Doppler frequency. A mobile channel simulator is used to show how much the equalizer can improve the BER in real-world urban channels. The performance of adaptive equalization for indoor high-data-rate systems is evaluated. An equalization structure for pi /4 DQPSK modulation is developed, and simulation results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Decision feedback equalizers","Adaptive equalizers","Bit error rate","Delay","Computer simulation","Least squares methods","Resonance light scattering","Fading","Degradation","Frequency"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["equalisers","error statistics","fading","feedback","mobile radio systems","telecommunication channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["urban mobile channels","RLS algorithm","decision feedback equalizers","indoor mobile channels","computer simulation","bit-error-rate","two-ray Rayleigh fading channel","BER performance","mobile channel simulator","adaptive equalization","indoor high-data-rate systems","pi /4 DQPSK modulation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245377","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245377.pdf","startPage":"368","endPage":"371 vol.1","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245377","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance of decision feedback equalizers in urban and indoor mobile channels","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245377","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Performance of decision feedback equalizers in urban and indoor mobile channels","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245377/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4372582","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance of decision feedback equalizers in urban and indoor mobile channels","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245377.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.048177S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"7","articleId":"245377","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":245386,"authors":[{"name":"E.

It is shown that such a packet switching interface can support more voice channels that the conventional DS0/DS1 circuit switching interface and is an essential element in achieving the soft handoff capability.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245400","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245400.pdf","startPage":"47","endPage":"50 vol.1","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245400","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Architectural design of a code division multiple access cellular system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245400","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245400/","displayDocTitle":"Architectural design of a code division multiple access cellular system","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4372559","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Architectural design of a code division multiple access cellular system","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245400.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051233S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"3","articleId":"245400","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":245401,"authors":[{"name":"Q.

The DADD can be readily configured for various data rates, intermediate frequencies, and reference oscillator frequencies.

Its performance in AWGN and Rayleigh fading channels was analyzed and verified by computer simulations. Results show the relation between the performance of the system and the memory introduced by the double-interval overlapping pulse shape. By properly using this memory, it is possible to achieve superior performance compared to conventional schemes. Even though no coding has been used, comparable results to coded schemes was obtained with no extra redundancy. Therefore, the complexity caused by multilevel modulation can be avoided, and transmission of signals with compact spectrum and good performance is possible. The constant envelope, compact spectrum, superior performance in fading channels and low complexity make the hardlimited IJF-OQPSK scheme a good choice for portable/mobile communications, to achieve low cost, small size, and high power and bandwidth efficiencies.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"IJF-OQPSK modulation schemes with MLSE receivers for portable/mobile communications","publicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","doi":"10.1109/VETEC.1992.245482","displayPublicationTitle":"[1992 Proceedings] Vehicular Technology Society 42nd VTS Conference - Frontiers of Technology","pdfPath":"/iel2/657/6293/00245482.pdf","startPage":"676","endPage":"680 vol.2","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/VETEC.1992.245482","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6293","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245482","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245482/","chronOrPublicationDate":"10-13 May 1992","displayDocTitle":"IJF-OQPSK modulation schemes with MLSE receivers for portable/mobile communications","conferenceDate":"10-13 May 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4362708","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"IJF-OQPSK modulation schemes with MLSE receivers for portable/mobile communications","confLoc":"Denver, CO, USA","sourcePdf":"00245482.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.043262S","chronDate":"10-13 May 1992","isNumber":"6293","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"657","citationCount":"2","articleId":"245482","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":245483,"authors":[{"name":"R.

The cell area per bit measures 0.962 mu m/sup 2/, using 0.4- mu m CMOS technology, which is 63% in comparison with the conventional cell. In order to reduce the die size, time division multiplex sense-amplifier (TMS) architecture, in which a sense amplifier is shared by four bit lines, has been newly introduced. The chip area is 464 mm/sup 2/, which is 68% compared with the DRAM using the current cell structure.

A 0.72- mu m/sup 2/ double-cylindrical recessed stacked-capacitor (RSTC) cell is used to ensure a storage capacitance of 25 fF/cell. A typical access time under a 2-V power supply voltage was 70 ns.

The architecture for write uses alternate twin word activation (ATWA) with bit-line pulsing. A dummy cell is used to obtain a reference voltage for reading. An excellent balance between a normal cell signal line and a dummy cell signal line is attained using balanced common data-line architecture. A newly developed self-bias-control (SBC) sense amplifier provides excellent stability and fast sensing performance for input voltages close to V/sub CC/ at a low power supply of 2.5 V. The single-bit-line architecture is incorporated in a 16-Mb SRAM, which was fabricated using 0.25- mu m CMOS technology. The proposed single-bit-line architecture reduces the cell area to 2.3- mu m/sup 2/, which is two-thirds of a conventional two-bit-line cell with the same processes.

The subthreshold current of the decoded-driver is reduced to the order of 10/sup -3/ in the practical temperature range (250-350 K) with 254 mV of self-reverse biasing voltage, while the delay time is only 3% more than in conventional schemes.

The wave-number spectrum and other relevant properties of these fields are estimated. A theory is derived for reconstructing neuromagnetic fields from measurements using sensor arrays which sample either the field component B/sub z/ perpendicular to the planar grid of measurement points, or the two components partial B/sub z//partial x and partial B/sub z//partial y of its gradient in the xy plane. The maximum sensor spacing consistent with a unique reconstruction is determined for both cases. It is shown that, when two orthogonal components of the gradient are measured at every site of the measurement grid, the density of these sensor-pair units can be reduced, without risk of aliasing, to half of what is necessary for single-channel sensors in an array sampling B/sub z/ alone. Thus the planar and axial gradiometer arrays are equivalent in the sampling sense provided that the number of independent measurements per unit area is equal.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Sampling methods","Detectors","Sensor arrays","Density measurement","Area measurement","Measurement units"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","biomagnetism","biomedical equipment","biomedical measurement","brain","magnetometers","medical signal processing","SQUIDs"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["planar gradiometer arrays","SQUIDs","MEG arrays","neuromagnetic detector arrays","sampling theorem","wave-number-limited multivariable functions","neuromagnetic field mapping","wave-number spectrum","maximum sensor spacing","orthogonal components","axial gradiometer arrays"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Brain Mapping","Cerebral Cortex","Equipment Design","Magnetoencephalography","Models, Neurological","Multivariate Analysis","Sampling Studies","Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted"]}],"doi":"10.1109/10.245606","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6297/00245606.pdf","startPage":"859","endPage":"869","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.245606","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Sampling theory for neuromagnetic detector arrays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245606","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Sampling theory for neuromagnetic detector arrays","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245606/","volume":"40","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4615215","pubMedId":"8288276","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sampling theory for neuromagnetic detector arrays","sourcePdf":"245606.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048603S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"90","articleId":"245606","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-28"},{"_id":245607,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Very low bit rates on the order of 70 b/s are achieved with a relatively low reconstruction error (percent RMS difference-PRD) of less than 10%.

Practical solution of these equations depends critically on the realization of an effective sparse matrix solver. Experience with several conjugate gradient-type methods is reported. The findings show that convergence rate (and even convergence in some cases) degrades significantly with increasing matrix rank and decreasing electrical loss for mesh spacings which adequately resolve the physical wavelengths of the electromagnetic wave propagation. However, with proper choice of algorithm and preconditioning, reliable convergence has been achieved for matrix ranks exceeding 2*10 5 on domains having sizeable volumes of electrically lossless regions. An automatic grid generation scheme for constructing meshes which consist of variable element sizes that conform to a predefined set of boundaries is discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6297/00245615.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"945","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6297","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.245615","doi":"10.1109/10.245615","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245615","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Finite element methods","Hyperthermia","Equations","Sparse matrices","Robustness","Degradation","Propagation losses","Electromagnetic propagation","Convergence","Mesh generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["biothermics","medical computing","mesh generation","physiological models","radiation therapy","radiofrequency heating"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mesh construction","computer simulation","finite element computation","EM heating","specific absorption rates","anatomically conforming full-body models","hyperthermia treatment analysis","Helmholtz weak forms","effective sparse matrix solver","conjugate gradient-type methods","convergence rate","automatic grid generation scheme"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Algorithms","Computer Simulation","Electromagnetic Fields","Humans","Hyperthermia, Induced","Models, Anatomic","Models, Biological"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245615/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Finite element computations of specific absorption rates in anatomically conforming full-body models for hyperthermia treatment analysis","accessionNumber":"4615224","pubMedId":"8288285","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","volume":"40","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite element computations of specific absorption rates in anatomically conforming full-body models for hyperthermia treatment analysis","sourcePdf":"245615.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.070727S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6297","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"41","articleId":"245615","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":245622,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The modeling concept of NMs was introduced in a previously published paper (V.Z. Marmarelis, ibid., vol.36, p.15-24, 1989) in order to provide concise and general mathematical representations of the nonlinear dynamics involved in signal transformation and coding by a class of neural systems. The authors present and demonstrate (with computer simulations) a method by which the NMs are determined using the 1stand 2nd-order kernel estimates of the system, obtained from input-output data. The MT operator (i.e., a binary operator with multiple real-valued operands which are the outputs of the NMs) possesses an intrinsic refractory mechanism and generates the sequence of output spikes. The spike-generating characteristics of the MT operator are determined by the \"trigger regions\" defined on the basis of data. This approach is offered as a reasonable compromise between modeling complexity and prediction accuracy, which may provide a common methodological framework for modeling a certain class of neural systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Predictive models","Nonlinear dynamical systems","Computer simulation","Kernel","Accuracy"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neurophysiology","physiological models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural systems modeling","neuronal modes","spike-output neural systems","input-output data","concise general mathematical representations","nonlinear dynamics","signal transformation","signal coding","computer simulations","kernel","binary operator","modeling complexity","prediction accuracy"]},{"type":"MeSH Terms","kwd":["Computer Simulation","Models, Neurological","Neurons","Nonlinear Dynamics"]}],"doi":"10.1109/10.245633","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/10/6298/00245633.pdf","startPage":"1149","endPage":"1158","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/10.245633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling of neural systems by use of neuronal modes","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245633","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling of neural systems by use of neuronal modes","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245633/","volume":"40","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4621292","pubMedId":"8307599","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling of neural systems by use of neuronal modes","sourcePdf":"245633.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08538S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"59","articleId":"245633","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":245668,"authors":[{"name":"G.

First, the CPW discontinuity without airbridges is analyzed using the space-domain integral equation (SDIE) approach. Second, the parameters (phase, amplitude, and wavelength) of the coplanar and slotline modes are extracted from an amplitude modulated-like standing wave existing in the CPW feeding lines. Then a 2n*2n generalized scattering matrix of the n-port discontinuity without airbridges is derived which includes the occurring mode conversion. Finally, this generalized scattering matrix is reduced to an n*n matrix by enforcing suitable conditions at the ports which correspond to the excited slotline mode. For the purpose of illustration, the method is applied to a shielded asymmetric short-end CPW shunt stub, the scattering parameters of which are compared with those of a symmetric one. Experiments are performed on both discontinuities and the results are in good agreement with theoretical data. The advantages of using airbridges in CPW circuits as opposed to bond wires are also discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245676/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","volume":"41","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4592729","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Characterization of asymmetric coplanar waveguide discontinuities","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Characterization of asymmetric coplanar waveguide discontinuities","sourcePdf":"00245676.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.034674S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"46","articleId":"245676","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":245683,"authors":[{"name":"P.H.

By using the central-difference divergence relation the conventional Yee algorithm is rewritten as a hybrid Yee/FDTD scalar-wave algorithm. It is found that this can reduce the computation time for many 3-D open geometries, in particular planar structures, by approximately two times as well as reduce the computer-memory requirements by approximately one-third. Moreover, it is demonstrated both mathematically and verified by numerical simulation of a coplanar strip transmission line that this hybrid algorithm is entirely equivalent to the Yee algorithm. In addition, an alternate but mathematically equivalent reformulation of the Enquist-Majda absorbing boundary condition based on the normal field component (relative to the absorbing boundary wall) is given to increase the efficiency of the hybrid algorithm in the modeling of open region problems. Numerical results generated by the hybrid Yee/scalar-wave algorithm for the Vivaldi antenna are given and compared with published experimental work.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.245683","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.245683","endPage":"1600","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00245683.png","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6300/00245683.pdf","startPage":"1593","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid Yee algorithm/scalar-wave equation approach","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245683/","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid Yee algorithm/scalar-wave equation approach","volume":"41","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"4592734","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid Yee algorithm/scalar-wave equation approach","sourcePdf":"00245683.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063705S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"42","articleId":"245683","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":245695,"authors":[{"name":"K.

The circuit features the best reported CPW distributed amplifier noise figure and phase performance over 2-20 GHz as well as an on-chip bias network and low dc power consumption. The minimum measured noise figure is 2.1 dB with 11 dB maximum gain. The measured phase linearity is less than +or-50 over 2-20 GHz which makes this circuit well suited for system phased array applications where phase matching and linearity are a primary concern.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Phase noise","Coplanar waveguides","Distributed amplifiers","Low-noise amplifiers","Transmission line measurements","HEMTs","Circuits","Noise figure","Linearity","Phased arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field effect integrated circuits","gallium arsenide","high electron mobility transistors","III-V semiconductors","indium compounds","linear integrated circuits","microstrip components","microwave amplifiers","MMIC","semiconductor device noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low noise amplifier","phase linear","distributed coplanar waveguide","fabrication","InGaAs","high electron mobility transistor","HEMT","decade-bandwidth","CPW","design methodology","transmission line loss modeling","amplifier noise figure","phase performance","on-chip bias network","low DC power consumption","phased array applications","SHF","LNA","MMIC","2 to 20 GHz","2.1 dB","11 dB"]}],"doi":"10.1109/22.245695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6300/00245695.pdf","startPage":"1650","endPage":"1653","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6300","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.245695","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A low noise, phase linear distributed coplanar waveguide amplifier","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245695","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A low noise, phase linear distributed coplanar waveguide amplifier","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245695/","volume":"41","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4598784","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A low noise, phase linear distributed coplanar waveguide amplifier","sourcePdf":"00245695.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043432S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6300","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"5","articleId":"245695","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":245712,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.M.

Manufacturer's published data are usually based on AC ratings, and the burden often falls on the user to determine the DC applicability. Furthermore, the manufacturer's DC test data may not necessarily apply to the DC system at hand. Factors including circuit time constant, voltage, and available short-circuit current may preclude the use of certain DC rated fuses.

In the proposed system, the load torque is estimated by the minimal-order state observer based on the torque component of a vector-controlled IM. Using the load-torque observer, a speed controller can be provided with a torque feedforward loop, thus realizing a robust speed control system. The control system is composed of a DSP-based controller, a voltage-fed pulsewidth modulated (PWM) transistor inverter and a 3.7 kW IM system. An eccentric load with an arm and a weight is coupled to the IM and it generates the sinusoidal gravitational fluctuating torque. Experimental results show robustness against disturbance torque and system parameter change.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4579783","displayDocTitle":"Robust speed control of IM with torque feedforward control","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust speed control of IM with torque feedforward control","sourcePdf":"00245892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.028105S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6307","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"81","articleId":"245892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":245906,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Spatial bandwidth reuse can significantly increase the effective throughput delivered by the network. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any dual ring or bus architecture such as MetaRing. In the dual bus configuration, when transporting ATM cells, the local fairness algorithm can be implemented using two generic flow control (GFC) bits in the ATM cell header. In the performance it is shown that this local fairness algorithm can exploit the throughput advantage offered by spatial bandwidth reuse better than a global fairness algorithm. This is accomplished because it ensures fair use of network resources among nodes that are competing for the same subset of links, while permitting free access to noncongested parts of the network. The performance advantage of the local fairness scheme is demonstrated by simulating the system under various traffic scenarios and comparing the results to that of the MetaRing SAT-based global fairness algorithm. It is also shown that under certain traffic patterns, the performance of this algorithm achieves the optimal throughput result predicted by the known Max-Min fairness definition.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.245907","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6308/00245907.pdf","endPage":"1192","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A local fairness algorithm for gigabit LAN's/MAN's with spatial reuse","doi":"10.1109/49.245907","startPage":"1183","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245907","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"A local fairness algorithm for gigabit LAN's/MAN's with spatial reuse","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245907/","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4580061","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"11","issue":"8","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A local fairness algorithm for gigabit LAN's/MAN's with spatial reuse","sourcePdf":"00245907.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038702S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"38","articleId":"245907","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":245918,"authors":[{"name":"A.K.

Deflection routing is an adaptive routing strategy that performs well on such architectures. A general analytic model has been developed to study the performance of buffered deflection routing in regular networks. The Manhattan street network, the ShuffleNet, and the shuffle exchange network have been studied as candidate two-connected networks with different topological characteristics. The results show that deflection routing performs well on both the Manhattan street network and the ShuffleNet, even under heavy loads, while on the shuffle exchange network it does not perform as well. The introduction of just a few buffers provides significant improvement in the delay-throughput performance over unbuffered deflection routing, especially in networks with large propagation delays. The analytic results are found to match the simulations very closely in most cases.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/49.245918","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications","pdfPath":"/iel1/49/6308/00245918.pdf","startPage":"1302","endPage":"1316","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/49.245918","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6308","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An approximate analysis of the performance of deflection routing in regular networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=245918","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/245918/","displayDocTitle":"An approximate analysis of the performance of deflection routing in regular networks","volume":"11","issue":"8","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4580072","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An approximate analysis of the performance of deflection routing in regular networks","sourcePdf":"00245918.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032464S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6308","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"49","citationCount":"21","articleId":"245918","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-07-23"},{"_id":245964,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In this paper the parallel approach to force/position control of robotic manipulators is presented. It shows a complete use of the available sensor measurements by operating the control action in a full-dimensional space without using selection matrices. Conflicting situations between the position and force tasks are managed using a priority strategy: the force control loop is designed to prevail over the position control loop. This choice ensures limited deviations from the prescribed force trajectory in every situation, guaranteeing automatic recovery from unplanned collisions. A dynamic force/position parallel control law is presented and its performance in presence of an elastic environment is analyzed; simplification of the dynamic control law is also discussed leading to a PID-type parallel controller. Two case studies are worked out that show the effectiveness of the approach in application to an industrial robot.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Force control","Position control","Parallel robots","Force sensors","Automatic control","Robot sensing systems","Orbital robotics","Manipulators","Extraterrestrial measurements","Performance analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["force control","position control","robots","three-term control"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["robotic manipulators","full-dimensional space","unplanned collision recovery","dynamic force/position parallel control","elastic environment","PID-type parallel controller","industrial robot"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=246048","doi":"10.1109/70.246048","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","pdfPath":"/iel4/70/6313/00246048.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/70.246048","startPage":"361","endPage":"373","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6313","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The parallel approach to force/position control of robotic manipulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"The parallel approach to force/position control of robotic manipulators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/246048/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4588450","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The parallel approach to force/position control of robotic manipulators","sourcePdf":"00246048.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067973S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"223","articleId":"246048","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":246049,"authors":[{"name":"J.E.

Traditionally, a bilateral manipulator is designed for transparency; i.e. so that the impedance reflected through the manipulator closely approximates that of the task. \"Impedance shaping bilateral control\", introduced here, differs in that it treats the bilateral manipulator as a means of constructively altering the impedance of a task. This concept is particularly valuable if the characteristic dimensions (e.g. force, length, time) of the task impedance are very different from those of the human limb. It is shown that a general form of impedance shaping control consists of a conventional power-scaling bilateral controller augmented with a real-time interactive task simulation (i.e. a virtual environment). An approach to impedance shaping based on kinematic similarity between tasks of different scale is introduced and illustrated with an example. It is shown that an important consideration in impedance shaping controller design is robustness; i.e. guaranteeing the stability of the operator/manipulator/task system. A general condition for the robustness of a bilateral manipulator is derived. This condition is based on the structured singular value ( mu ). An example of robust impedance shaping bilateral control is presented and discussed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/246049/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug 1993","volume":"9","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4588451","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"Robust impedance shaping telemanipulation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust impedance shaping telemanipulation","sourcePdf":"00246049.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043077S","chronDate":"Aug 1993","isNumber":"6313","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"70","citationCount":"200","articleId":"246049","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":246071,"authors":[{"name":"A.N.

In general, a Computer Vision System (CVS) attempts to relate scene(s) in terms of model(s). A typical CVS employs algorithms from a very broad spectrum such as numerical, image processing, graph algorithms, symbolic processing, and artificial intelligence. The authors present a multiprocessor architecture, called \"NETRA,\" for computer vision systems. NETRA is a highly flexible architecture. The topology of NETRA is recursively defined, and hence, is easily scalable from small to large systems. It is a hierarchical architecture with a tree-type control hierarchy. Its leaf nodes consists of a cluster of processors connected with a programmable crossbar with selective broadcast capability to provide the desired flexibility. The processors in clusters can operate in SIMD-, MIMD- or Systolic-like modes. Other features of the architecture include integration of limited data-driven computation within a primarily control flow mechanism, block-level control and data flow, decentralization of memory management functions, and hierarchical load balancing and scheduling capabilities.

Jobs arriving to this system have a linear fork-join structure. Each fork of the job gives rise to a random number of tasks that can be processed independently on any of the computers. Since exact analysis of fork-join models is known to be intractable, the authors resort to obtaining analytical bounds to the mean job response time of the fork-join job. For jobs with a single fork-join and, probabilistic allocation of tasks of the job to the N processors, they obtain upper and lower bounds to the mean job response time. Upper bounds are obtained using the concept of associated random variables and are found to be a good approximation to the mean job response time. A simple lower bound is obtained by neglecting queueing delays. They also find two lower bounds that include queueing delays. For multiple fork-join jobs, they study an approximation based on associated random variables. Finally, two versions of the join-the-shortest-queue (JSQ) allocation policy (i.e., JSQ by batch and JSQ by task) are studied and compared, via simulations and diffusion limits.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/71.246075","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/71/6314/00246075.pdf","startPage":"1147","endPage":"1164","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/71.246075","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Performance analysis and scheduling of stochastic fork-join jobs in a multicomputer system","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/246075/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis and scheduling of stochastic fork-join jobs in a multicomputer system","volume":"4","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4588647","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis and scheduling of stochastic fork-join jobs in a multicomputer system","sourcePdf":"00246075.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083546S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6314","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"71","citationCount":"37","articleId":"246075","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":246085,"authors":[{"name":"R.

II. A Chua's circuit primer","abstract":"For Pt. I see ibid., vol. 40, no. 10, p. 640, 1993. Linear system-theory provides an inadequate characterization of sustained oscillation in nature. This two-part exposition of oscillation in piecewise-linear dynamical systems, guides the reader from linear concepts and simple harmonic motion to nonlinear concepts and chaos. By means of three worked examples, the authors bridge the gap from the familiar parallel RLC network to exotic nonlinear dynamical phenomena in Chua's circuit. The goal is to stimulate the reader to think deeply about the fundamental nature of oscillation and to develop intuition into the chaos-producing mechanisms of nonlinear dynamics. In order to exhibit chaos, an autonomous circuit consisting of resistors, capacitors, and inductors must contain (1) at least one nonlinear element, (2) at least one locally active resistor, and (3) at least three energy-storage elements. Chua's circuit is the simplest electronic circuit that satisfies these criteria. In addition, this remarkable circuit is the only physical system for which the presence of chaos has been proved mathematically. The circuit is readily constructed at low cost using standard electronic components and exhibits a rich variety of bifurcations and chaos. Part II in this series studies bifurcations and chaos in a robust practical implementation of Chua's circuit.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/246141/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","volume":"40","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"4606072","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Three steps to chaos.

The chaotic behavior of the circuit closely matches the results predicted by numerical experiments. Using the concept of synchronized chaotic systems (SCS's), two possible approaches to secure communications are demonstrated with the Lorenz circuit implemented in both the transmitter and receiver. In the first approach, a chaotic masking signal is added at the transmitter to the message, and at the receiver, the masking is regenerated and subtracted from the received signal. The second approach utilizes modulation of the coefficients of the chaotic system in the transmitter and corresponding detection of synchronization error in the receiver to transmit binary-valued bit streams. The use of SCS's for communications relies on the robustness of the synchronization to perturbations in the drive signal. As a step toward further understanding the inherent robustness, we establish an analogy between synchronization in chaotic systems, nonlinear observers for deterministic systems, and state estimation in probabilistic systems. This analogy exists because SCS's can be viewed as performing the role of a nonlinear state space observer. To calibrate the robustness of the Lorenz SCS as a nonlinear state estimator, we compare the performance of the Lorenz SCS to an extended Kalman filter for providing state estimates when the measurement consists of a single noisy transmitter component.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.246163","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/6318/00246163.pdf","startPage":"626","endPage":"633","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6318","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.246163","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=246163","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synchronization of Lorenz-based chaotic circuits with applications to communications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/246163/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Synchronization of Lorenz-based chaotic circuits with applications to communications","volume":"40","issue":"10","accessionNumber":"4611269","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synchronization of Lorenz-based chaotic circuits with applications to communications","sourcePdf":"00246163.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05505S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"762","articleId":"246163","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":246164,"authors":[{"name":"H.

Theoretical interest in chaotic Sigma Delta modulators recently arose, mainly because the circuits are simple and strongly nonlinear systems with rich behavior, not unlike Chua's circuit. It has since been recognized that the application of conventional Sigma Delta modulators to A/D and D/A conversion may be haunted by spurious \"tones\" in the output, and it has been proposed to use chaotic modulators to overcome that problem. This paper employs a semi-analytical technique to solve the design problem for general chaotic double-loop modulators with constant inputs. Using the results, optimized scaling factors are easily found for given integrator pole locations, such that an approximate performance measure is maximized subject to bounds on internal state variables. The clarification of this explicit tradeoff between tone rejection through chaos, system stability, and practical performance may help to overcome some understandable scepticism in the community of Sigma Delta designers.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/82.246167","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Analog and Digital Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel4/82/6318/00246167.pdf","startPage":"651","endPage":"659","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/82.246167","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6318","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=246167","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Exploiting chaos to suppress spurious tones in general double-loop Sigma Delta modulators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Exploiting chaos to suppress spurious tones in general double-loop Sigma Delta modulators","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/246167/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","volume":"40","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4611273","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Exploiting chaos to suppress spurious tones in general double-loop Sigma Delta modulators","sourcePdf":"00246167.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031555S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"24","articleId":"246167","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":246168,"authors":[{"name":"D.R.

The determination of its quasi-chaotic behavior is based on QC-properties defined in the paper, which are proposed as a test for finite state digital filters.

System performance using many different chaotic attractors from the family of Chua attractors implemented by the Chua hardware circuit is investigated in an application to the problem of real time handwritten digit recognition. Several of these attractors outperform the previously studied Lorenz attractor system in terms of accuracy and speed of convergence. In the normal form projection algorithm, which was developed at Berkeley for associative memory storage of dynamic attractors, a matrix inversion determines network weights, given prototype patterns to be stored. There are N units of capacity in an N node network with 3N/sup 2/ weights. It costs one unit per static attractor, two per Fourier component of each periodic trajectory, and at least three per chaotic attractor. There are no spurious attractors, and for periodic attractors there is a Lyapunov function in a special coordinate system which governs the approach of transient states to stored trajectories. Unsupervised or supervised incremental learning algorithms for pattern classification, such as competitive learning or boot-strap Widrow-Hoff can easily be implemented. The architecture can be \"folded\" into a recurrent network with higher order weights that can be used as a model of cortex that stores oscillatory and chaotic attractors by a Hebb rule. A novel computing architecture has been constructed of recurrently interconnected associative memory modules of this type. Architectural variations employ selective synchronization of modules with chaotic attractors that communicate by broadspectrum chaotic signals to control the flow of computation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/246169/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4611275","volume":"40","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A neural network associative memory for handwritten character recognition using multiple Chua characters","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network associative memory for handwritten character recognition using multiple Chua characters","sourcePdf":"00246169.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054209S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6318","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"82","citationCount":"15","articleId":"246169","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-03"},{"_id":246202,"authors":[{"name":"S.-Y.

Test patterns for single stuck-line faults are used to compare the gate-level implementation of a circuit with its functional-level specification.

In the verification phase of the design of logic circuits using the top-down approach, it is necessary not only to detect but also to locate the source of any inconsistency that may exist between the specification and the implementation. This technique can determine the region containing the error. It has very high resolution and reduces the debugging time by the designers.

The model uses a four-dimensional neural network architecture to schedule the operations of a data flow graph (DFG), and maps them to specific functional units. Neural network-based scheduling (NNS) is achieved by formulating the scheduling problem in terms of an energy function, and by using the motion equation corresponding to the variation of energy. The algorithm searches the scheduling space in parallel and finds the optimal schedule. This yields an efficient parallel scheduling algorithm under time and resource constraints appropriate for implementing on a parallel machine. The algorithm is based on moves in the scheduling space, which correspond to moves towards the equilibrium point (lowest energy state) in the dynamic system space.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/EURDAC.1992.246221","pdfPath":"/iel2/409/6319/00246221.pdf","startPage":"341","endPage":"346","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings EURO-DAC '92: European Design Automation Conference","publicationTitle":"Proceedings EURO-DAC '92: European Design Automation Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/EURDAC.1992.246221","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6319","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A neural network based algorithm for the scheduling problem in high-level synthesis","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/246221/","chronOrPublicationDate":"7-10 Sep 1992","displayDocTitle":"A neural network based algorithm for the scheduling problem in high-level synthesis","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4493538","publicationDate":"1992","conferenceDate":"7-10 Sept. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A neural network based algorithm for the scheduling problem in high-level synthesis","confLoc":"Hamburg, Germany","sourcePdf":"00246221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.037842S","chronDate":"7-10 Sep 1992","isNumber":"6319","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"409","citationCount":"5","articleId":"246221","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":246232,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Three-phase chip planning and chip assembly have close interaction to guarantee an exchange of constraints between levels of the hierarchy. Chip assembly is composed of two different functions: cell synthesis, and cell assembly. For cell synthesis, standard cell block layout is used to demonstrate a new strategy. Instead of generating the layouts of blocks in the same floorplan independently, layout proceeds in parallel and constraints like pin positions, shape and position of the blocks in the floorplan are exchanged dynamically. This method results in excellent adjustment of pin positions between cells and reduction of channel widths. Independent of the cell synthesis strategy is cell assembly, viewed as a topological compaction problem to refine the floorplans. A genetic algorithm is shown to solve this problem.

ART2 networks are unsupervised self-organizing systems that cluster data into different classes. Learning is completed when these classes are labelled by an expert and are saved in a look-up table for use by the system. Recognition of new data is accomplished by finding the class assigned by ART2 and searching through the table to get the proper labels. Unrecognized inputs are put into a new class for future labelling. In this study an ART2 neural network with 20 inputs was developed and trained using EEG data containing spike and non-spike waveforms. For comparison a 20 input multilayer perceptron was constructed and evaluated similarly. Evaluation with three sets of EEG patterns indicates that the ART2 network's performance is close to that of multilayer perceptron showing its high potential. Considering that ART2 can be trained with one or a few iterations (compared to thousands required for backpropagation networks), monitoring systems with on-line training can be easily constructed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/IBED.1992.247111","startPage":"192","endPage":"197","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 International Biomedical Engineering Days","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/IBED.1992.247111","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6328","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 1992 International Biomedical Engineering Days","pdfPath":"/iel2/671/6328/00247111.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Detection of transient EEG patterns with adaptive unsupervised neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247111/","displayDocTitle":"Detection of transient EEG patterns with adaptive unsupervised neural networks","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"4523869","publicationDate":"1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Detection of transient EEG patterns with adaptive unsupervised neural networks","confLoc":"Istanbul, Turkey","sourcePdf":"00247111.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.042349S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug 1992","isNumber":"6328","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"671","articleId":"247111","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":247113,"authors":[{"name":"H.O.

A two-stage cascaded converter was selected for achieving 8-b resolution at a 1-GHz sampling rate. Key components for this kind of converter were developed, fabricated, and characterized. Measurements of the track and hold circuitry showed a droop of 3 mV/ mu s, a slew rate of 3 kV/ mu s, and a setting time of 220 ps. Its accuracy corresponds to 9.5 b at a 1-GHz clock rate with a 100-MHz input frequency. The 4-b quantizer operates up to 1.5 GSps. At 800 MSps, 3.8 effective bits were achieved with input frequencies up to 200 MHz.

The modes are dependent on various parameters such as duty ratio and load. Knowledge of the boundaries between operating modes is crucial. There are two types of methods to calculate these boundaries, but both present problems. The authors propose a new numerical method which has no problems. Numerical methods are based on finding and classifying steady-state operation waveforms numerically at a set of points in parameter space. This method is distinguished by its parsimonious choice of these points. The proposed algorithm is based on a binary recursive scheme, which permits the resolution with which the boundaries are computed to be selectively increased.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"9-11 Aug. 1992","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4523619","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Efficient numerical determination of boundaries between operating modes of a power converter","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient numerical determination of boundaries between operating modes of a power converter","confLoc":"Berkeley, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"00247310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06867S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"6331","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"687","citationCount":"8","articleId":"247310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":247312,"authors":[{"name":"A.M.

The case study involved elimination of the 5th, 7th, and 11th harmonics of the output voltage using four switching angles per quarter-cycle of the output frequency. Regular and sparse neural networks were experimented with. The regular network requires training, but the number of neurons is low. Training is not necessary for the sparse network which can be synthesized using a simple formula. The sparse network also offers higher accuracy than the regular network, at the expense of a significantly higher neuron count.

Test data for CMOS and SOI SRAMs, FG/EEPROMs and SNOS/EEPROMs are presented. After a presentation of the test conditions, the interpretation of the results for high density technologies are discussed. The test results are then summarized and discussed in detail. The data collected for high density SRAMs revealed a deviation from the effective LET cos theta law. This phenomenon may be correlated to the shape of the sensitive area. Some products exhibited a strong sensitivity asymmetry (0 to 1 or 1 to 0 transitions). This effect has been correlated to the basic cell design. In addition, an ion species dependence has been noticed for one type. A normalized plot showing a common behaviour of all the devices tested is presented. With respect to these phenomena, some guidelines are suggested to achieve a full characterization of the devices.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Heavy ion test results on memories","publicationTitle":"Workshop Record 1992 IEEE Radiation Effects Data Workshop","doi":"10.1109/REDW.1992.247328","displayPublicationTitle":"Workshop Record 1992 IEEE Radiation Effects Data Workshop","pdfPath":"/iel2/688/6332/00247328.pdf","startPage":"27","endPage":"33","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/REDW.1992.247328","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6332","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247328","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247328/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1992","displayDocTitle":"Heavy ion test results on memories","conferenceDate":"14-14 July 1992","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"1992","accessionNumber":"4499102","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Heavy ion test results on memories","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00247328.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051686S","chronDate":"1992","isNumber":"6332","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"688","citationCount":"38","articleId":"247328","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":247329,"authors":[{"name":"C.

The recognition system is built around the TMS320C30 DSP processor using a combination of artificial neural networks and conventional signal processing techniques. A vocabulary of 50 words selected from the modified rhyme test produced by six profoundly deaf subjects was recorded. The acoustic, temporal and segmental characteristics of their speech were studied to identify features that may be useful in improving the performance of the speech recognition system. These features may account for the high variability and production errors in deaf speech. A recognition model was built using artificial neural networks to control the variability, and to use the information concerning the acoustic, temporal and segmental errors in deaf speech in the recognition strategy. The recorded speech samples were randomized and separated into varying numbers of training and testing sets. Selected features were extracted from speech samples and used to train the network to recognize the speech characteristics of each speaker, in a supervised learning fashion. The ability of the network to use the additional features to carry out speaker dependent speech recognition was evaluated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/SBEC.1993.247339","startPage":"108","endPage":"110","displayPublicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Twelfth Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference","pdfPath":"/iel2/691/6333/00247339.pdf","publicationTitle":"[1993] Proceedings of the Twelfth Southern Biomedical Engineering Conference","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SBEC.1993.247339","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6333","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Isolated word recognition of deaf speech using artificial neural networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Deafness","Artificial neural networks","Acoustic testing","Prototypes","Digital signal processing","Acoustic signal processing","Vocabulary","Error correction","Feature extraction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","speech recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic characteristics","temporal characteristics","speech production errors","speech variability","deaf speech","artificial neural networks","prototype speech recognition system","isolated word recognition","TMS320C30 DSP processor","modified rhyme test","profoundly deaf subjects","segmental characteristics","recognition model","speech samples","supervised learning"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247339/","chronOrPublicationDate":"1993","displayDocTitle":"Isolated word recognition of deaf speech using artificial neural networks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","conferenceDate":"2-4 April 1993","accessionNumber":"4493997","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Isolated word recognition of deaf speech using artificial neural networks","confLoc":"New Orleans, LA, USA","sourcePdf":"00247339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05933S","chronDate":"1993","isNumber":"6333","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"691","citationCount":"2","articleId":"247339","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":247341,"authors":[{"name":"G.

A 20-40-GHz balanced high-intercept amplifier and a 30-GHz voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) have been successfully fabricated and tested. These circuits benchmark the first InP HBT microstrip designs at K-a-band frequencies. The high-intercept amplifier achieves a gain of 5 dB and an IP3 of 20 dBm at 35 GHz. The monolithic VCO uses a base emitter varactor diode to tune as high as 9% bandwidth from a nominal oscillation frequency of 30 GHz. The output power is invariant of VCO tuning and is about +9.9 dBm+or-0.5 dBm. The collector efficiency is 21%. The total power dissipation is 77 mW.

The method is applicable to heterostructures with confinement in any number of dimensions: e.g. bulk, quantum wells, quantum wires and quantum dots. It is applied here to model bulk and multiquantum well (MQW) InGaAsP active layer quaternary lasers. The band parameters of the quaternary system required for the modeling are interpolated from the available literature. We compare bulk versus MQW performance, the effects of compressive and tensile strain, room temperature versus high temperature operation and 1.3 versus 1.55 pm wavelength operation. Our model shows that: compressive strain improves MQW laser performance. MQW lasers have higher amplification per carrier and higher differential gain than bulk lasers, however, MQW performance is far from ideal because of occupation of non-lasing minibands. This results in higher carrier densities at threshold than in bulk lasers, and may nullify the advantage of MQW lasers over bulk devices for high temperature operation.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247701/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4609724","volume":"29","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Calculating the optical properties of multidimensional heterostructures: Application to the modeling of quaternary quantum well lasers","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Calculating the optical properties of multidimensional heterostructures: Application to the modeling of quaternary quantum well lasers","sourcePdf":"00247701.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054979S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"171","articleId":"247701","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":247704,"authors":[{"name":"K.

It is also shown that very wide modulation bandwidth can be attained by using the optimum CPW TW electrode thickness and overlaid layer thickness.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/3.247704","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/6339/00247704.pdf","startPage":"2466","endPage":"2475","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.247704","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6339","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-speed shielded velocity-matched Ti:LiNbO/sub 3/ optical modulator","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247704","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247704/","displayDocTitle":"High-speed shielded velocity-matched Ti:LiNbO/sub 3/ optical modulator","volume":"29","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4609727","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-speed shielded velocity-matched Ti:LiNbO/sub 3/ optical modulator","sourcePdf":"00247704.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048724S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"17","articleId":"247704","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":247709,"authors":[{"name":"A.J.W.

In particular, when coherent light is presented to the input of the amplifier, the output photon statistics are characterized by a marked-Poisson (MP) point process, which has a noncentral-negative-binomial (NNB) output photon-number distribution (PND). Using this distribution we calculate the probability of error (PE) for an ON-OFF keying (OOK) direct-detection photon-counting communication system, and show that the results differ somewhat from those obtained when the Gaussian-PND approximation is used. It is shown that receiver performance is optimized by filtering the amplifier output. Analysis of the point process is of interest because it permits the time response of the amplifier to be determined; this, in turn, allows the effects of intersymbol interference to be calculated.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Photon point process for traveling-wave laser amplifiers","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","doi":"10.1109/3.247716","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Quantum Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel1/3/6339/00247716.pdf","startPage":"2568","endPage":"2578","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/3.247716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6339","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247716","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247716/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Photon point process for traveling-wave laser amplifiers","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"29","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4609739","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Photon point process for traveling-wave laser amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00247716.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05524S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6339","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3","citationCount":"21","articleId":"247716","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":247744,"authors":[{"name":"H.

This paper theoretically analyzes the performance of a subspace separation technique based on orthogonal projections (OP) for adaptively suppressing interference in phased arrays; the theoretical performance predictions are validated using computer simulations. This analysis holds for the case when it is possible to differentiate between the vector spaces spanned by jammers and additive noise. The performance parameters used are (a) the average residual interference (jammer plus noise) power at the output of the adapted array as a function of the number of jammer snapshots used for calculating the weight vector, and (b) the similarity of the adapted array pattern to the design pattern away from the jammer locations. The performance of the OP-based subspace separation technique is compared with the sample matrix inversion (SMI) algorithm. It is shown that the weight vector calculated using OP converges more quickly to the optimal solution (infinite number of interference snapshots) than the SMI weight vector. Further, in contrast to the SMI adapted pattern, which exhibits large sidelobe levels away from the jammer locations, the OP adapted pattern closely follows the design pattern both in the mainbeam and in the sidelobe region away from the jammer locations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.247744","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6341/00247744.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.247744","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1187","endPage":"1194","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interference suppression via orthogonal projections: a performance analysis","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247744","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Interference suppression via orthogonal projections: a performance analysis","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247744/","volume":"41","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4615173","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interference suppression via orthogonal projections: a performance analysis","sourcePdf":"00247744.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038147S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"62","articleId":"247744","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":247748,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The technique utilizes a transformation which divides the problem into two decoupled subproblems. One subproblem involves the determination of certain coefficients of the contour transformation in order to achieve the required footprint contours. The number of coefficients which need to be used depends on the complexity of the desired contour, but is very small in comparison to the number of planar array elements. The other subproblem consists of a linear array shaped beam synthesis, for which there already exist powerful methods for determining appropriate element excitations. The size required for this prototype linear array depends on the number of contour transformation coefficients used and the size of the final planar array. Simple formulas then determine the final planar array excitations from the information forthcoming from the above two subproblem solutions.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A contoured beam synthesis technique for planar antenna arrays with quadrantal and centro-symmetry","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.247748","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6341/00247748.pdf","startPage":"1222","endPage":"1231","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.247748","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247748","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247748/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"A contoured beam synthesis technique for planar antenna arrays with quadrantal and centro-symmetry","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"9","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4615177","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A contoured beam synthesis technique for planar antenna arrays with quadrantal and centro-symmetry","sourcePdf":"00247748.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048497S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"16","articleId":"247748","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":247751,"authors":[{"name":"R.

Furthermore, the authors provide insight as regards the capability of triangular basis functions to model near field patterns.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/8.247757","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","startPage":"1296","endPage":"1301","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6341/00247757.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.247757","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Theoretical and numerical treatment of surface integrals involving the free-space Green's function","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Surface treatment","Green's function methods","Message-oriented middleware","Moment methods","Boundary conditions","Stability","Shape","Kernel","Surface waves"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic wave scattering","Green's function methods","integral equations","numerical analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic scattering","surface integrals","free-space Green's function","double-triangular basis functions","method of moments","perfectly conducting surfaces","near field patterns"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Theoretical and numerical treatment of surface integrals involving the free-space Green's function","volume":"41","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4615186","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247757/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Theoretical and numerical treatment of surface integrals involving the free-space Green's function","sourcePdf":"00247757.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.051001S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"71","articleId":"247757","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":247759,"authors":[{"name":"J.M.

The aircraft is modeled with I-DEAS solid modeling software using a parametric surface approach. High-frequency RCS is obtained through physical optics (PO), method of equivalent currents (MEC), physical theory of diffraction (PTD), and impedance boundary condition (IBC). This method is based on a new and original implementation of high-frequency techniques which the authors have called graphical electromagnetic computing (GRECO). A graphical processing approach of an image of the target at the workstation screen is used to identify the surfaces of the target visible from the radar viewpoint and obtain the unit normal at each point. High-frequency approximations to RCS prediction are then easily computed from the knowledge of the unit normal at the illuminated surfaces of the target. The image of the target at the workstation screen (to be processed by GRECO) can be potentially obtained in real time from the I-DEAS geometric model using the 3-D graphics hardware accelerator of the workstation. Therefore, CPU time for RCS prediction is spent only on the electromagnetic part of the computation, while the more time-consuming geometric model manipulations are left to the graphics hardware. This hybrid graphic-electromagnetic computing (GRECO) results in real-time RCS prediction for complex radar targets.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.247759","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341","startPage":"1308","endPage":"1319","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6341/00247759.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"High-frequency RCS of complex radar targets in real-time","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247759/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"High-frequency RCS of complex radar targets in real-time","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4615188","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"41","issue":"9","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"High-frequency RCS of complex radar targets in real-time","sourcePdf":"00247759.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.037649S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"120","articleId":"247759","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":247761,"authors":[{"name":"J.H.

Several authors have recently applied the FDTD method to antenna radiation problems. To date, the antenna structures considered have been wire and conical monopole antennas, rectangular waveguides, pyramidal horn antennas, and microstrip antennas. Results from these analysis have been in the form of normalized field patterns and no results showing absolute gain have been presented. The article demonstrates the first staircased application of the FDTD method to the analysis of radiation from circular waveguides and other shaped-end radiators. Results of absolute gain versus angle are shown for a straight-cut circular waveguide and for two different shaped-end radiators. All FDTD analyses are full three-dimensional computations and are compared in each case with measured data.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6341/00247761.pdf","startPage":"1324","endPage":"1327","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.247761","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.247761","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6341","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247761","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis of electromagnetic radiation from shaped-end radiators using the finite difference time domain method","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electromagnetic analysis","Electromagnetic radiation","Finite difference methods","Microstrip antennas","Horn antennas","Time domain analysis","Electromagnetic waveguides","Electromagnetic scattering","Wire","Rectangular waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["antenna radiation patterns","circular waveguides","electromagnetic wave scattering","finite difference time-domain analysis","horn antennas","microstrip antennas","monopole antennas","rectangular waveguides"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic radiation","shaped-end radiators","finite difference time domain method","FDTD","electromagnetic scattering","EM penetration","antenna radiation problems","conical monopole antennas","rectangular waveguides","pyramidal horn antennas","microstrip antennas","wire antennas","normalized field patterns","absolute gain","angle","straight-cut circular waveguide","three-dimensional computations","measured data"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247761/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sep 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sep 1993","displayDocTitle":"Analysis of electromagnetic radiation from shaped-end radiators using the finite difference time domain method","volume":"41","issue":"9","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","accessionNumber":"4615190","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis of electromagnetic radiation from shaped-end radiators using the finite difference time domain method","sourcePdf":"00247761.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035455S","chronDate":"Sep 1993","isNumber":"6341","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"11","articleId":"247761","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":247767,"authors":[{"name":"K.W.

Five test settings were chosen in urban, suburban, and rural areas in order to study propagation in a variety of environments. This paper reports the LOS measurements in different environments, all of which show variations of signal strength with distance that have distinct near and far regions separated by a break point. It was also found that the location of the break point for different frequencies and antenna heights can be calculated based on first Fresnel zone clearance. The regression analysis reveals a slope that is less than two before the break point, while it is greater than two after the break point. This break distance can be used to define the size of microcell and to design for fast hand-off. Beyond the first Fresnel zone break distance the base station antenna height gain was observed to approximately follow the square power law of antenna height.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Radio propagation characteristics for line-of-sight microcellular and personal communications","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","doi":"10.1109/8.247785","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation","pdfPath":"/iel4/8/6342/00247785.pdf","startPage":"1439","endPage":"1447","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/8.247785","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6342","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247785","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247785/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Radio propagation characteristics for line-of-sight microcellular and personal communications","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4615207","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Radio propagation characteristics for line-of-sight microcellular and personal communications","sourcePdf":"00247785.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058938S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6342","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8","citationCount":"198","articleId":"247785","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":247787,"authors":[{"name":"Ming-Shing Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ming-Shing Lin","id":"37349645000"},{"name":"Ruey-Beei Wu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Ruey-Beei Wu","id":"37279512600"},{"name":"Chun Hsiung Chen","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Chun Hsiung Chen","id":"37351222600"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-926X"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-2221"}],"articleNumber":"247787","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":101},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Antennas and Propagation Society","url":"http://www.ieeeaps.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Time domain analysis","Anisotropic magnetoresistance","Power system transients","Equations","Distributed parameter circuits","Electromagnetic transients","Propagation losses","Slabs","Coupling circuits","Circuit simulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic pulse","lumped parameter networks","time-domain analysis","transient response","transmission line theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["inhomogeneous anisotropic lossy slabs","equivalent transmission line circuit","transient propagation","plane wave","transversely lossy slabs","coupled transmission line equations","lumped-circuit models","circuit simulation program","accuracy","convergence","ETLC model","anisotropic graphite/epoxy laminates","transient responses","electromagnetic pulse","Gaussian pulse","field equations"]}],"abstract":"An equivalent-transmission-line-circuit (ETLC) model is developed to discuss the transient propagation problem of a plane wave in inhomogeneous, anisotropic, and transversely lossy slabs.

Experiments were done in chronic cats with a goal of designing a rule-based controller to generate rhythmic movements of the ankle joint during treadmill locomotion. Neural signals from the tibial and superficial peroneal nerves were recorded with cuff electrodes and processed simultaneously with muscular signals from ankle flexors and extensors in the cat's hind limb. Cuff electrodes are an effective method for long-term chronic recording in peripheral nerves without causing discomfort or damage to the nerve. For real-time operation the authors designed a low-noise amplifier with a blanking circuit to minimize stimulation artifacts. They used threshold detection to design a simple rule-based control and compared its output to the pattern determined using adaptive neural networks. Both the threshold detection and adaptive networks are robust enough to accommodate the variability in neural recordings. The adaptive logic network used for this study is effective in mapping transfer functions and therefore applicable for determination of gait invariants to be used for closed loop control in an FES system. Simple rule-bases will probably be chosen for initial applications to human patients. However, more complex FES applications require more complex rule-bases and better mapping of continuous neural recordings and muscular activity. Adaptive neural networks have promise for these more complex applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247801/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct.  1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"40","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4587098","pubMedId":"8294127","displayDocTitle":"Sensory nerve recording for closed-loop control to restore motor functions","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Sensory nerve recording for closed-loop control to restore motor functions","sourcePdf":"247801.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069342S","chronDate":"Oct.  1993","isNumber":"6343","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10","citationCount":"121","articleId":"247801","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":247835,"authors":[{"name":"Mao-Chao Lin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Mao-Chao Lin","id":"37366138800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9340"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9956"},{"format":"CD","value":"2326-3814"}],"articleNumber":"247835","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":12,"totalDownloads":68},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computer Society","url":"http://www.computer.org"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247835","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Error correction codes","Computer errors","Space technology","Parity check codes","Decoding","Communication system control","Control systems","Error correction","Very large scale integration","Linear code"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error correction codes","error detection codes","errors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["constant weight codes","symmetric errors","correcting","detecting","unidirectional errors","quasi-systematic form","systematic form","parity check","codewords","error-control coding","t-EC/AUED codes"]}],"abstract":"Proposes two classes of constant weight codes, which can be used for correcting t symmetric errors and simultaneously detecting all unidirectional errors.

The algorithm is distributed and requires no global knowledge of faults. The only knowledge required at a node is the state of its incident links. The routed message carries information about the followed path and the visited nodes. The algorithm routes messages along the optimal, i.e., the shortest path if no faults are encountered or if the faults are such that an optimal path still exists. In the absence of an optimal path, the algorithm always finds a path between two nodes within a bounded number of hops if the two nodes are connected. Otherwise, it returns the message to the originating node. The authors provide a performance analysis for the case where an optimal path does not exist. They prove that for a maximum of n-2 faults on a graph with N=n! nodes, at most 2i+2 steps are added to the path, where i is O( square root n). Finally, they use the routing algorithm to present an efficient broadcast algorithm on the star graph in the presence of faults.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/12.247843","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","startPage":"1398","endPage":"1403","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Computers","pdfPath":"/iel1/12/6345/00247843.pdf","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00247843.png","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/12.247843","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6345","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A routing and broadcasting scheme on faulty star graphs","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Broadcasting","Multiprocessor interconnection networks","Fault tolerance","Performance analysis","Communication channels","Hypercubes","Network topology","Redundancy","System recovery"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distributed algorithms","fault tolerant computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["routing scheme","broadcasting scheme","faulty star graphs","depth first search","backtracking technique","faulty links","shortest path","optimal path","performance analysis"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","displayDocTitle":"A routing and broadcasting scheme on faulty star graphs","volume":"42","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4598796","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247843/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A routing and broadcasting scheme on faulty star graphs","sourcePdf":"00247843.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067326S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6345","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"12","citationCount":"55","articleId":"247843","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":247854,"authors":[{"name":"S.Y.

The model is based on the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD) and takes into account multiple wall-to-wall, wall-to-ground, and ground-to-wall reflections, the diffraction from corners of buildings, and subsequent reflections from such diffracted signals. The ray geometry is made extremely complex by the presence of ground reflections and the many combinations of sequences of reflections or diffractions from walls, edges, and ground. At each reflection or diffraction point, the local ray-fixed coordinate system or edge-fixed coordinate system is used together with appropriate dyadic reflection or diffraction coefficient matrices. The theoretical results for the signal path loss along the streets are compared with measurements done in New York and Tokyo for various values of the propagation parameters. Agreement with these measurements indicates that the UTD formulation is a good model for such urban communication applications.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/15.247854","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility","pdfPath":"/iel1/15/6346/00247854.pdf","startPage":"423","endPage":"428","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/15.247854","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6346","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"UTD propagation model in an urban street scene for microcellular communications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247854","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247854/","displayDocTitle":"UTD propagation model in an urban street scene for microcellular communications","volume":"35","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4627425","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"UTD propagation model in an urban street scene for microcellular communications","sourcePdf":"00247854.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044663S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6346","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"15","citationCount":"80","articleId":"247854","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":247856,"authors":[{"name":"R.

In a few instances, the systems also possess some ability to learn using deduction or supervised induction. We introduce a novel AI-based system for generating static schedules that makes heavy use of an unsupervised learning module in acquiring significant portions of the requisite problem processing knowledge. This scheduler pursues a hybrid schedule generation strategy wherein it effectively combines knowledge acquired via genetics-based unsupervised induction with rote-learned knowledge in generating high-quality schedules in an efficient manner. Through a series of experiments conducted on a randomly generated problem of practical complexity, we show that the hybrid scheduler strategy is viable, promising, and, worthy of more in-depth investigations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4587251","volume":"23","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A genetics-based hybrid scheduler for generating static schedules in flexible manufacturing contexts","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A genetics-based hybrid scheduler for generating static schedules in flexible manufacturing contexts","sourcePdf":"00247881.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059619S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1993","isNumber":"6347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"47","articleId":"247881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-14"},{"_id":247882,"authors":[{"name":"G.V.S.

The STM model provides information for recognition and reproduction of arbitrary temporal sequences. Sequences are acquired by a new learning rule, the attentional learning rule, which combines Hebbian learning and a normalization rule with sequential system activation. Acquired sequences can be recognized without being affected by speed of presentation or certain distortions in symbol form. Different layers of the STM model can be naturally constructed in a feedforward manner to recognize hierarchical sequences, significantly expanding the model's capability in a way similar to human information chunking. A model of sequence reproduction is presented that consists of two reciprocally connected networks, one of which behaves as a sequence recognizer. Reproduction of complex sequences can maintain interval lengths of sequence components, and vary the overall speed. A mechanism of degree self-organization based on a global inhibitor is proposed for the model to learn required context lengths in order to disambiguate associations in complex sequence reproduction. Certain implications of the model are discussed at the end of the paper.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/21.247884","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6347/00247884.pdf","startPage":"993","endPage":"1009","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.247884","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Timing and chunking in processing temporal order","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1993","displayDocTitle":"Timing and chunking in processing temporal order","volume":"23","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4587254","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Timing and chunking in processing temporal order","sourcePdf":"00247884.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057063S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1993","isNumber":"6347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"32","articleId":"247884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-30"},{"_id":247892,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Methods to solve the satisfiability problem play an important role in the development of computing theory and systems. Traditional methods treat the SAT problem as a constrained decision problem. During past research, the number of unsatisfiable clauses as the value of an objective function was formulated. This transforms the SAT problem into a search problem-an unconstrained optimization problem to the objective function. A variety of iterative optimization techniques can be used to solve this optimization problem. In this paper, the author shows how to use the local search techniques to solve the satisfiability problem. The average time complexity analysis and numerous real algorithm executions were performed. They indicate that the local search algorithms are much more efficient than the existing SAT algorithms for certain classes of conjunctive normal form (CNF) formulas.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/21.247892","doi":"10.1109/21.247892","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","pdfPath":"/iel1/21/6347/00247892.pdf","startPage":"1108","endPage":"1129","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6347","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Local search for satisfiability (SAT) problem","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Local search for satisfiability (SAT) problem","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247892/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"23","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1993","accessionNumber":"4587262","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Local search for satisfiability (SAT) problem","sourcePdf":"00247892.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055896S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1993","isNumber":"6347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"59","articleId":"247892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":247896,"authors":[{"name":"V.S.

Modeling the control system by a time Petri net permits us to develop an analytical procedure for fault detection.

It demonstrates an alternative view to structure identification, transforming the problem of structure identification to estimation of the distribution of input space. A new concept of sample probability distributions (SPD) is introduced and a family of SPD is constructed. This allows us to simplify the problem of structure identification by replacing identification of membership functions of input variables with identification of the centers of cluster-like regions. The fuzzy model complex of fuzzy model is also discussed in connection with the modeller's confidence and two types of confidence-a priori and a posteriori confidence-are also suggested. The identification problem is solved also under the additional requirement of simplification of the model structure. A learning algorithm realizing structure and parameter identification of quasilinear fuzzy models with the simplest structure is proposed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jul/Aug 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247902/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jul/Aug 1993","volume":"23","issue":"4","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"July-Aug. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4587272","displayDocTitle":"Unified structure and parameter identification of fuzzy models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Unified structure and parameter identification of fuzzy models","sourcePdf":"00247902.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029117S","chronDate":"Jul/Aug 1993","isNumber":"6347","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"21","citationCount":"103","articleId":"247902","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":247910,"authors":[{"name":"P.F.

The radiation patterns of a double-slot antenna on a silicon dielectric lens are computed using ray-tracing inside the dielectric lens and electric and magnetic field integration on the spherical dielectric surface. The measured radiation patterns at 246 GHz and Gaussian-beam coupling efficiencies show good agreement with theory. The theoretical results are presented in terms of extension-length/radius and radius/ lambda , and therefore result in universal design curves for silicon lenses of different diameters and at different frequencies. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that for single units, there exists a wide range of extension lengths which result in high Gaussian-coupling efficiencies (50-60%) to moderately high f 's. These Gaussian-coupling efficiencies can be increased to 80-90 degrees % with the use of a lambda /sub m//4 matching-cap layer. For imaging array applications with high packing densities, an extension-length/radius of 0.38 to 0.39 (depending on frequency) will result in peak directivity and a corresponding Gaussian-coupling efficiency 15-20% lower than for single units.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.247919","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.247919","startPage":"1738","endPage":"1749","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6348/00247919.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Double-slot antennas on extended hemispherical and elliptical silicon dielectric lenses","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247919/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Double-slot antennas on extended hemispherical and elliptical silicon dielectric lenses","volume":"41","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4644672","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Double-slot antennas on extended hemispherical and elliptical silicon dielectric lenses","sourcePdf":"00247919.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068459S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"563","articleId":"247919","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":247920,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

The dielectric lens antenna is fed by a planar antenna that is mounted on the flat side of the dielectric lens antenna, using it as a substrate, and the combination is termed a hybrid antenna. Beam pattern and aperture efficiency measurements were made at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths as a function of the extension of the hemispherical lens and of lens size. An optimum extension distance for which excellent beam patterns and simultaneously high aperture efficiencies can be achieved is found experimentally and numerically. At 115 GHz the aperture efficiency was measured to be (76+or-6)% for a diffraction-limited beam with sidelobes below -17 dB. Results for a single hybrid antenna with an integrated superconductor-insulator-superconductor (SIS) detector and a broadband matching structure at submillimeter wavelengths are presented. The hybrid antenna is space efficient in an array due to its high aperture efficiency, and is easily mass produced, thus being well suited for focal plane heterodyne receiver arrays.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.247920","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6348/00247920.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.247920","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6348","startPage":"1750","endPage":"1760","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An improved solution for integrated array optics in quasi-optical mm and submm receivers: the hybrid antenna","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247920","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"An improved solution for integrated array optics in quasi-optical mm and submm receivers: the hybrid antenna","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247920/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4644673","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An improved solution for integrated array optics in quasi-optical mm and submm receivers: the hybrid antenna","sourcePdf":"00247920.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.058526S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"63","articleId":"247920","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":247921,"authors":[{"name":"Moonil Kim","affiliation":["Central Research Laboratory, Gold Star Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Moonil Kim","id":"37278672400"},{"name":"E.A.

The active devices in the grid are chips with heterojunction-bipolar-transistor (HBT) differential pairs. The metal grid pattern was empirically designed to provide effective coupling between the HBTs and free space. Two independent measurements, one with focusing lenses and the other without, were used to characterize the grid. In each case, the peak gain was 10 dB at 10 GHz with a 3-dB bandwidth of 1 GHz. The input and output return losses were better than 15 dB at 10 GHz. The maximum output power was 450 mW, and the minimum noise figure was 7 dB. By varying the bias, a signal could be amplitude modulated with a modulation index as large as 0.65. Tests show that the grid was quite tolerant of failures-the output power dropped by only 1 dB when 10% of the inputs were detuned. The grid amplifier is a multimode device that amplifies beams of different shapes and angles. Beams with incidence angles up to 30 degrees were amplified with less than a 3-dB drop in gain.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6348/00247921.pdf","startPage":"1762","endPage":"1771","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","doi":"10.1109/22.247921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.247921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6348","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=247921","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A 100-element HBT grid amplifier","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Heterojunction bipolar transistors","Power generation","Semiconductor device measurement","Lenses","Gain","Bandwidth","Noise figure","Amplitude modulation","Testing","Power amplifiers"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bipolar integrated circuits","differential amplifiers","microwave amplifiers","MMIC"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["HBT grid amplifier","heterojunction-bipolar-transistor differential pairs","metal grid pattern","focusing lenses","peak gain","return losses","maximum output power","minimum noise figure","modulation index","output power","multimode device","incidence angles","10 GHz","450 mW","7 dB"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247921/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"A 100-element HBT grid amplifier","volume":"41","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4644674","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A 100-element HBT grid amplifier","sourcePdf":"00247921.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.066977S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"62","articleId":"247921","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":247922,"authors":[{"name":"Moonil Kim","affiliation":["Center Research Laboratory, Gold Star Company Limited, Seoul, South Korea","Department of Electrical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA"],"lastName":"Moonil Kim","id":"37087168650"},{"name":"E.A.

It is found that free-running frequencies of the peripheral elements have the strongest influence on the steady-state phase relationships. The influence of randomness in the frequency distribution is considered for the case of broadside beamforming, establishing a critical value for the coupling strength in order to maintain mutual synchronization with a specified maximum beam deviation.

It is shown that a constant phase progression can be established by slightly detuning the peripheral array elements, while maintaining mutual synchronization. This unusual nonlinear behavior is explained using coupled Van der Pol equations. A stability analysis provides theoretical limitations on the achievable interelement phase shift. When the phase of the coupling is zero, the theory predicts an interelement phase shift that can be varied continuously over the range -90 degrees > Delta theta <+90 degrees and is independent of the number of oscillators in the array. An experimental four-element planar MESFET array was built, operating at 10 GHz with close to zero coupling phase, giving a measured phase progression that was continuously variable over the range -88 degrees < Delta theta <66 degrees .<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/22.247927","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques","pdfPath":"/iel1/22/6348/00247927.pdf","startPage":"1810","endPage":"1815","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/22.247927","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6348","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new phase-shifterless beam-scanning technique using arrays of coupled oscillators","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/247927/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"A new phase-shifterless beam-scanning technique using arrays of coupled oscillators","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4644680","volume":"41","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new phase-shifterless beam-scanning technique using arrays of coupled oscillators","sourcePdf":"00247927.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.039644S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6348","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"22","citationCount":"241","articleId":"247927","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":248001,"authors":[{"name":"J.R.

The objective is to make an initial assessment of what advantages a fuzzy learning control approach has over conventional adaptive control approaches. The simulation results indicate that the fuzzy model reference learning controller (FMRLC) has several potential advantages over model reference adaptive control (MRAC), including improved convergence rates, use of less control energy, enhanced disturbance rejection properties, and lack of dependence on a mathematical model. Using the comparative analysis, the authors discuss how the well-developed concepts in conventional adaptive control can be used to evaluate fuzzy learning control techniques.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/37.248001","pdfPath":"/iel1/5488303/6350/00248001.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"34","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","publicationTitle":"IEEE Control Systems Magazine","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/37.248001","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6350","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fuzzy model reference learning control for cargo ship steering","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/248001/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Fuzzy model reference learning control for cargo ship steering","volume":"13","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4579170","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fuzzy model reference learning control for cargo ship steering","sourcePdf":"00248001.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.065383S","chronDate":"Dec.  1993","isNumber":"6350","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5488303","citationCount":"150","articleId":"248001","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":248006,"authors":[{"name":"S.

For the circuit to meet a given clocking specification, it is necessary for each combinational stage to satisfy a certain delay requirement. Roughly speaking, increasing the sizes of some transistors in a stage reduces the delay, with the penalty of increased area. The problem of transistor sizing is to minimize the area of a combinational stage, subject to its delay being less than a given specification. Although this problem has been recognized as a convex programming problem, most existing approaches do not take full advantage of this fact, and often give nonoptimal results. An efficient convex optimization algorithm has been used here. This algorithm is guaranteed to find the exact solution to the convex programming problem. We have also improved upon existing methods for computing the circuit delay as an Elmore time constant, to achieve higher accuracy, CMOS circuit examples, including a combinational circuit with 832 transistors are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the new algorithm.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/248073/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov 1993","volume":"12","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4603485","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","displayDocTitle":"An exact solution to the transistor sizing problem for CMOS circuits using convex optimization","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An exact solution to the transistor sizing problem for CMOS circuits using convex optimization","sourcePdf":"00248073.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.060932S","chronDate":"Nov 1993","isNumber":"6352","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"43","citationCount":"197","articleId":"248073","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":248076,"authors":[{"name":"I.

The concept of a local transform is applied for the generalization of the ratio parameter method for M(1) multiplexer synthesis having one data select input and a spectral method for M(2) multiplexer synthesis to determine redundant multiplexer inputs for M(k) multiplexer circuits. The algorithm developed for multilevel synthesis of M(k) multiplexer circuits for incompletely specified multioutput Boolean functions takes advantage of the combination of spectral and Boolean methods.

This poses severe limitations to the design of future ultrasound equipment, such as 3-D imaging scanners. The authors describe a technique for higher data acquisition rates based on the simultaneous transmission of multiple beams. By using a linear combination of the received beams, interbeam interference due to the sidelobe energy of the transmitting beams can be significantly reduced. The transformation coefficients are found by using a least squares minimization criterion. A simulation environment used for the evaluation of the authors' methodologies and various simulation results are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00248216.png","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","pdfPath":"/iel1/58/6356/00248216.pdf","startPage":"717","endPage":"726","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectrics, and Frequency Control","doi":"10.1109/58.248216","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/58.248216","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6356","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=248216","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Beam transformation techinques for ultrasonic medical imaging","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biomedical imaging","Ultrasonic imaging","Ultrasonic transducer arrays","Displays","Ultrasonic transducers","Focusing","Acoustic beams","Image resolution","Ultrasonic variables measurement","Heart"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["acoustic imaging","biomedical ultrasonics","data acquisition","least squares approximations","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["sound speed","3D imaging scanners","multiple beams simultaneous transmission","beam transformation techniques","ultrasonic medical imaging","pulsed ultrasound scanners","human body","ultrasound equipment","data acquisition rates","interbeam interference","sidelobe energy","transformation coefficients","least squares minimization criterion","simulation environment"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/248216/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Nov.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Beam transformation techinques for ultrasonic medical imaging","volume":"40","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 1993","accessionNumber":"4599837","pubMedId":"18263239","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Beam transformation techinques for ultrasonic medical imaging","sourcePdf":"00248216.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.032714S","chronDate":"Nov.  1993","isNumber":"6356","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"58","citationCount":"22","articleId":"248216","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":248217,"authors":[{"name":"S.W.

The connector consists of 20 thick films of alumina and screen printed metallization with customized interconnections between the layers called vias. Ten ground layers are interleaved between ten signal layers to reduce elecrical crosstalk. A lambda /4 mismatching layer of conductive epoxy is bonded between each PZT element and the silver metal pad of the MLC connector to provide an effective low impedance backing. In the current configuration, a 16*16 transducer array, 0.6 mm element spacing, is expanded to a 16*16 grid of connector pins at a standard spacing of 2.5 mm. Vector impedance, sensitivity, bandwidth, interelement uniformity, and crosstalk are all in good agreement with arrays of conventional fabrication.

Adaptive phase-deaberration algorithms compensate for phase errors in the wavefront. The algorithms suffer, however, when the wavefront is also significantly distorted. A theory which shows that the rise of image background level, which is the average sidelobe floor (ASF), in a single point-like source image is proportional to the amplitude distortion of the wavefront and inversely proportional to the effective number of array elements is derived. From the theory, the tolerance to the amplitude distortion, after the phasefront has been corrected by a deaberration algorithm, can be calculated based on the design requirement of the sidelobe floor for a given array.

Industry currently calculates the current carrying capacity of underground power cable based on the assumption of a purely sinusoidal 60 Hz current. However, increasing levels of harmonics on power systems have raised concern about their effect on cable ampacities. The issue has already been addressed for distribution cables. This paper begins with a discussion of Neher and McGrath's classic equations and some recent revisions, and develops a closed form composite equation accurately reflecting the effect of harmonics. The effect of frequency on the loss ratio is shown and supported by comparison with measured data at 60 Hz and a finite element analysis at a number of harmonic frequencies. The effect of specific harmonic scenarios is shown in light of the IEEE standard on harmonics. The results are used to develop a derating factor to compensate for current harmonics on transmission systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/61.248274","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.248274","startPage":"1689","endPage":"1695","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/6358/00248274.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6358","previewImage":"/xploreAssets/images/absImages/00248274.png","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Pipe-type cable ampacities in the presence of harmonics","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Pipe-type cable ampacities in the presence of harmonics","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4610431","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/248274/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Pipe-type cable ampacities in the presence of harmonics","sourcePdf":"00248274.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031913S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"16","articleId":"248274","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":248285,"authors":[{"name":"M.

This shunt employs parallel connected diodes to automatically insert and disconnect the measurement resistance, very close to the current zero. The realized precision and sensitivity allow reproducible measurements down to tens of milliamperes range, with about a 5 MHz bandwidth. Furthermore repetitive testing with main currents of up to 80 kA peak poses no problem with this configuration. Using this technique the authors have discovered a new type of post-arc current which can last many milliseconds without provoking circuit breaker failure.

Basic components of the apparatus were a fast solid-state switch and a current limiting impedance of low resistance in parallel with the switch. Experimental results of the test current limiter showed the fault current was limited successfully, regardless of DC component size. The time from detection of fault occurrence to interruption of the fault current by the solid-state switch was 40 mu s. This time was very short in comparison with that before the fault current reached a large value. Thermal rise of the solid-state switch for conduction was solved by a self-cooling apparatus using a noncombustible cooling liquid. The results indicated that the solid-state current limiter was a valuable protecting device for high fault current distribution systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/248287/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","accessionNumber":"4610445","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","volume":"8","issue":"4","displayDocTitle":"Solid-state current limiter for power distribution system","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solid-state current limiter for power distribution system","sourcePdf":"00248287.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043687S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"77","articleId":"248287","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":248288,"authors":[{"name":"A.

In this paper, a method is presented for state space formulation of machine windings. The described procedure is completely based on external terminal impedance measurements and data related to the internal structure is not required. First, the wide frequency behavior of machine windings is reviewed and the nonlinearity effects of the iron core are discussed. A numerical method is given for calculation of the state equation parameters directly from the measured terminal impedance characteristics. The presented modeling method is applicable to any transformer, reactor or rotating machine in service where sufficient information on the internal design is not available. Besides, the canonical structure of the model offers advantages in terms of computer memory and computation effort in time domain analyses of complex power systems.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency","Power transformers","Power system modeling","Power system analysis computing","Power system measurements","Power system transients","Inductors","Rotating machines","Machine windings","Impedance measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electric impedance measurement","electric machines","machine theory","machine windings","parameter estimation","power transformers","state-space methods"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["wide frequency range modeling","power transformers","rotating machines","power system components","reactors","electromagnetic transients","state space formulation","machine windings","external terminal impedance measurements","nonlinearity effects","iron core","numerical method","state equation parameters","time domain analyses","parameter estimation"]}],"doi":"10.1109/61.248288","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/6358/00248288.pdf","startPage":"1802","endPage":"1810","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.248288","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A method for wide frequency range modeling of power transformers and rotating machines","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=248288","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A method for wide frequency range modeling of power transformers and rotating machines","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/248288/","volume":"8","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4610446","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A method for wide frequency range modeling of power transformers and rotating machines","sourcePdf":"00248288.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.054303S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"38","articleId":"248288","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":248299,"authors":[{"name":"J.L. del Alamo","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Valladolid, Spain"],"firstName":"J.L.","lastName":"del Alamo","id":"37381167300"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0885-8977"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1937-4208"}],"articleNumber":"248299","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":61,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":458},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Power & Energy Society","url":"http://www.ieee.org/portal/index.jsp?pageID=pes_home"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=248299","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Conductivity","Mathematical model","Grounding","Soil measurements","Inverse problems","Parameter estimation","Jacobian matrices","Electric variables measurement","IEEE members","Least squares approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["earthing","electric variables measurement","parameter estimation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electrical grounding parameters","two-layered earth","optimum estimation","parameter estimation","Wenner's Method","resistivity measurement","optimization methods","first order gradient methods","Newton-method","Levenberg-Marquardt method","generalized inverse method","quasi-Newton method","Newton-generalized inverse method"]}],"issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6358","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","doi":"10.1109/61.248299","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A comparison among eight different techniques to achieve an optimum estimation of electrical grounding parameters in two-layered earth","startPage":"1890","endPage":"1899","pdfPath":"/iel3/61/6358/00248299.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/61.248299","abstract":"This paper intends to compare the performance of eight techniques, based on five different methods, used to find the electrical grounding parameters of a two-layered earth (resistivities and thickness) corresponding to a specific mathematical model.

Firstly, the paper presents a review of the mathematical basis of five optimization methods used for the implementation of the different techniques subject to comparison. Secondly, the paper defines the implementation of the algorithms for the eight techniques. Three of them are of first order gradient type, one more of second order (Newton-method), the fifth one is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt method, the sixth one on the generalized inverse method, the seventh one on a quasi-Newton method and the last one on a mixed Newton-generalized inverse method.

While some degree of graceful degradation was observed, the single-layer perceptron was considerably less fault tolerant than any of the multilayer perceptrons, including one with fewer adjustable weights. Our initial hypothesis that fault tolerance would be significantly improved for multilayer nets with larger numbers of hidden units proved incorrect. Indeed, there appeared to be a liability to having excess hidden units. A simple technique (called augmentation) is described, which was successful in translating excess hidden units into improved fault tolerance. Finally, our results were supported by applying singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis to the MLP's internal representations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/72.248456","startPage":"788","endPage":"793","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","pdfPath":"/iel4/72/6363/00248456.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/72.248456","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6363","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Determining and improving the fault tolerance of multilayer perceptrons in a pattern-recognition application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Fault tolerance","Multilayer perceptrons","Degradation","Artificial neural networks","Nonhomogeneous media","Very large scale integration","Parallel processing","Neural networks","Redundancy","Measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["backpropagation","fault tolerant computing","feedforward neural nets","pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault tolerance","multilayer perceptrons","pattern recognition","hidden units","augmentation","singular value decomposition","internal representations","backpropagation training","coin classification"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/248456/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","displayDocTitle":"Determining and improving the fault tolerance of multilayer perceptrons in a pattern-recognition application","volume":"4","issue":"5","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","accessionNumber":"4588629","pubMedId":"18276508","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Determining and improving the fault tolerance of multilayer perceptrons in a pattern-recognition application","sourcePdf":"00248456.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.038473S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"68","articleId":"248456","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":248459,"authors":[{"name":"J.

They are primarily used for decision making and selection. As an alternative to the conventional activation-based winner-take-all mechanisms (AWTA), we present a time-based temporal-winner-take-all mechanism with O(n) space complexity and roughly O(log n) time complexity. The mechanism exploits systematic and stochastic differences between time delays within different units and connections. The TWTA and the AWTA networks are shown to be logically equivalent, but the TWTA mechanism may be more suitable than the latter for various selection tasks, especially the selection of an arbitrary unit from a set (e.g., as in unit recruitment). TWTA avoids various problems with conventional WTA, notably the difficulty of making it converge rapidly over a large range of conditions. Here we report a probabilistic analysis of the TWTA mechanism along with experimental data obtained from numerous massively parallel simulations of the TWTA mechanism on the connection machine.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  1993","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/248461/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Sept.  1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4588634","pubMedId":"18276513","volume":"4","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Sept. 1993","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Temporal winner-take-all networks: a time-based mechanism for fast selection in neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Temporal winner-take-all networks: a time-based mechanism for fast selection in neural networks","sourcePdf":"00248461.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043507S","chronDate":"Sept.  1993","isNumber":"6363","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"72","citationCount":"9","articleId":"248461","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":248462,"authors":[{"name":"Su-Ling Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Su-Ling Lee","id":"37087173654"},{"name":"Shyang Chang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan"],"lastName":"Shyang Chang","id":"37087401869"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1045-9227"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1941-0093"}],"articleNumber":"248462","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":25,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":50},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Computational Intelligence Society","url":"http://ieee-cis.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Neural networks","Routing","Communication networks","Telecommunication network topology","Biology computing","Computer networks","Degradation","Concurrent computing","Speech recognition","Cost function"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural nets","telecommunication network routing","telecommunications computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication network routing","neural network model","Routron","lower bounds","upper bounds","design parameters"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=248462","abstract":"A new neural network model, Routron, which can handle dependent component failures of communication networks, is proposed.

To improve the BAM performance, an exponential function is used to enhance the correlations between the binary vectors of the retrieval key and that of the stored pattern similar to the key.

For interpolation problems this prior knowledge frequently includes smoothness requirements on the network mapping, and can be imposed by the addition to the error function of suitable regularization terms. The new error function, however, now depends on the derivatives of the network mapping, and so the standard backpropagation algorithm cannot be applied. In this letter, we derive a computationally efficient learning algorithm, for a feedforward network of arbitrary topology, which can be used to minimize such error functions.

The goal is to investigate automated partitioning of behavior into hardware and software. The design methodology allows gradual, continuous repartitioning of codesign operations during design. For instance, designers might start with an all-software implementation and check the implementation's functionality: they might then refine the implementation over time to a mixed hardware-software implementation. At the system level, the authors use an object-oriented approach to identify the basic objects and associated functions of a system. They divide them into three groups: hardware, software, and codesign . They represent the codesign group's objects and functions using a prototype codesign specification language, Object-Oriented Functional Specifications (OOFS), which lets one describe system state in objects and write object methods as pure functions. Thus, the authors can describe complex systems without biasing the implementation toward hardware or software.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/2.248879","publicationTitle":"Computer","displayPublicationTitle":"Computer","pdfPath":"/iel1/2/6372/00248879.pdf","startPage":"42","endPage":"47","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/2.248879","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6372","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Codesign from cospecification","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=248879","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1994","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1994","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/248879/","displayDocTitle":"Codesign from cospecification","volume":"27","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1994","accessionNumber":"4666079","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Codesign from cospecification","sourcePdf":"00248879.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.035015S","chronDate":"Jan.  1994","isNumber":"6372","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"2","citationCount":"38","articleId":"248879","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"1994","subType":"IEEE Magazine","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":248936,"authors":[{"name":"N.W.

A distinguishing feature of this approach is that target detection and tracking are combined into a single optimization procedure that takes into account statistical models of target motion, background noise, and clutter. Current work has led to a number of technical innovations that improve the performance and efficiency of the DP tracking algorithm, including the development of a new track scoring function, and an extension to the basic DP algorithm that reduces computation requirements by over an order of magnitude. A prototype infrared (IR) target tracking system incorporating these enhancements has been implemented for a step-starting IR camera application.

The need for a library of multivariable correlated non-Gaussian PDFs in order to characterize various clutter scenarios is discussed. Specifically,. the theory of spherically invariant random processes (SIRPs) is examined in detail. Approaches based on the marginal envelope PDF and the marginal characteristic function have been used to obtain several multivariate non-Gaussian PDFs. An important result providing the PDF of the quadratic form of a spherically invariant random vector (SIRV) is presented.

Design targets for this exploratory development program include system (generator-plus-converter) power density of 1 kVA/lb and mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) of 500 h. At the heart of the new variable-speed constant-frequency (VSCF) configuration is a high-frequency resonant link inverter designed so that all inverter switching occurs under zero-voltage conditions. Advantages include minimization of switching losses and significant reductions in power device switching stresses and electromagnetic interference (EMI) generation. Inverter losses are further reduced by using MOS-controlled thyristors (MCTs) as the power switches in order to take advantage of their low forward voltage. A 60 kVA breadboard version of the system has been constructed, and test results which confirm its key performance characteristics are presented.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/7.249126","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","pdfPath":"/iel4/7/6377/00249126.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6377","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/7.249126","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","startPage":"206","endPage":"214","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new resonant link aircraft power generating system","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=249126","pubTopics":[{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan 1993","displayDocTitle":"A new resonant link aircraft power generating system","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/249126/","volume":"29","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 1993","accessionNumber":"4392559","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new resonant link aircraft power generating system","sourcePdf":"249126.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.029614S","chronDate":"Jan 1993","isNumber":"6377","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7","citationCount":"18","articleId":"249126","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":249134,"authors":[{"name":"B.

The calculations indicate that, with overvolted short gaps, the apparent absence of the protracted ion current tail in the overall pulse form is due to the large excess of the electron current component generated by strongly enhanced cathode emission by the photoeffect and other phenomena. Under conditions of high overvoltage the ion-impact-induced emission, the ion fluxes and, consequently, the ion current component are greatly reduced as compared to the electron current. The long ion current tail, representing not more than a few percent of the total current, passes undetected. Pulseless and pseudo-glow discharges are considered.

In the case of an unknown defect, a combination of these operators is compared to the same set of operators for a known configuration. In this way, a statement can be made on the character of a discharge source. The use of this technique in evaluating different discharges in HV cable and in 400 kV SF/sub 6/ insulation confirms the usefulness of the new approach.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electrical Insulation","pdfPath":"/iel1/14/6381/00249370.pdf","startPage":"969","endPage":"983","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computer-aided measurement of partial discharges in HV equipment","doi":"10.1109/14.249370","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6381","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/14.249370","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=249370","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/249370/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Computer-aided measurement of partial discharges in HV equipment","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4632782","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"28","issue":"6","isJournal":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computer-aided measurement of partial discharges in HV equipment","sourcePdf":"00249370.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.043456S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6381","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"14","citationCount":"169","articleId":"249370","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":249372,"authors":[{"name":"E.

The first is concerned with common minimum distance classification, using statistical data on pulse quantities such as apparent charge, energy and phase. Applying the correct algorithms and features, such a system is able to discriminate between unknown defects using conventional discharge patterns. Classification with neural networks, which offers the possibility of classifying the shape of the PD pulses without using statistical tools for data reduction, is also discussed. Examples of diagnostic decisions are shown for a gas-insulated-switchgear system with several artificially introduced defects. The reliability of the diagnosis is estimated for both time-resolved detection evaluated by neural networks and classic phase-resolved PD evaluation.

From this distribution, it is possible to find the lowering of the potential barrier between the source and the channel, and the corresponding threshold-voltage shift.

Expressions for the subthreshold current and for a generalized unified charge control model (UCCM) for short-channel MOSFETs are presented.

The lifetime improvement is attributed to detrapping of holes. At high frequencies, the improvement is maximum because the trapped holes are concentrated at the interface where they can easily be removed upon field reversal. At low frequencies, there is less improvement because the trapped hole distribution extends further into the oxide.

Experimentally it is found that for MOSFETs with thin gate oxide (t/sub ox/ approximately=70 AA) and high substrate concentration (N/sub D/ approximately=1.6*10/sup 17/ cm/sup -3/) the reduction in the drain current I/sub DS/ can be as large as 10% to 20% for devices with insufficiently doped polysilicon gate (5*10/sup 18/<or=N/sub p/<or=1.6*10/sup 19/ cm/sup -3/). Theoretically it is shown that the drain current degradation becomes more pronounced as N/sub p/ decreases, t/sub ox/ decreases, or N/sub D/, increases. A modified Pao-Sah model that takes into account the polysilicon depletion effect and an accurate gate-field-dependent mobility model are used to compute I-V characteristics for various values of N/sub p/, t/sub ox/, and N/sub D/. Good agreement between experimental and modeled results is observed over a wide range of devices.<<ETX>>","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel1/16/6384/00249483.pdf","startPage":"2330","endPage":"2337","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/16.249483","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/16.249483","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6384","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=249483","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Measurements and modeling of MOSFET I-V characteristics with polysilicon depletion effect","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["MOSFET circuits","Voltage","Degradation","Silicon","FETs","Impurities","Neodymium","Intrusion detection","Fabrication","Implants"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["doping profiles","elemental semiconductors","insulated gate field effect transistors","interface electron states","semiconductor device models","semiconductor doping","semiconductor-insulator boundaries","silicon"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["modeling","MOSFET","I-V characteristics","polysilicon depletion effect","current-voltage characteristics","polysilicon gate concentration","oxide thickness","substrate impurity concentration","polycrystalline Si","drain current degradation","modified Pao-Sah model","gate-field-dependent mobility model","70 angstrom","Si-SiO/sub 2/"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/249483/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1993","displayDocTitle":"Measurements and modeling of MOSFET I-V characteristics with polysilicon depletion effect","volume":"40","issue":"12","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 1993","accessionNumber":"4632727","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Measurements and modeling of MOSFET I-V characteristics with polysilicon depletion effect","sourcePdf":"00249483.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.068079S","chronDate":"Dec 1993","isNumber":"6384","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"35","articleId":"249483","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":249573,"authors":[{"name":"A.

The design equations are based on continuum mechanics rather than on molecular micromechanics, and can be implemented in an engineering design environment.

The resulting mathematical programming formulation determines the optimal level of component reliability and the number of redundant components at each stage. The problem is a multiobjective, nonlinear, mixed-integer mathematical programming problem, subject to several design constraints. Sequential unconstrained minimization techniques in conjunction with heuristic algorithms are used to find an optimum solution. A generalization of the problem in view of inherent vagueness in the objective and the constraint functions results in an ill-structured reliability apportionment problem. This multiobjective fuzzy optimization problem is solved using nonlinear programming. The computational procedure is illustrated through a numerical example. The fuzzy optimization techniques can be useful during initial stages of the conceptual design of engineering systems where the design goals and design constraints have not been clearly identified or stated, and for decision making problems in ill-structured situations.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Redundancy","Mathematical programming","Minimization methods","Heuristic algorithms","Fuzzy systems","Constraint optimization","Design optimization","Reliability engineering","Design engineering","Systems engineering and theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","fuzzy logic","minimisation","nonlinear programming","reliability theory"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["failure analysis","mixed-integer programming","reliability","redundancy","series systems","multiple objectives","time-dependent","components","design","minimization","heuristic algorithms","fuzzy optimization","nonlinear programming","engineering systems","decision making"]}],"doi":"10.1109/24.249589","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Reliability","pdfPath":"/iel1/24/6387/00249589.pdf","startPage":"576","endPage":"582","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6387","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/24.249589","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optimal apportionment of reliability and redundancy in series systems under multiple objectives","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=249589","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Optimal apportionment of reliability and redundancy in series systems under multiple objectives","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/249589/","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Dec. 1992","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4369957","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec 1992","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Dec 1992","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optimal apportionment of reliability and redundancy in series systems under multiple objectives","sourcePdf":"00249589.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.046583S","chronDate":"Dec 1992","isNumber":"6387","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"24","citationCount":"152","articleId":"249589","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1992","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-12-18"},{"_id":249646,"authors":[{"name":"A.A.

Two different guided-to-leaky transitions have been identified, namely the ordinary cutoff and the extraordinary cutoff, which occur when considering negative and positive birefringent materials, respectively. Analytical but transcendental expressions have been obtained, yielding the critical optical axis orientation, relative to the waveguide axis, above which the totally guided hybrid modes become leaky. The results indicate that the value of the critical orientation strongly depends on the waveguide parameters.

In such systems, nonlinear degradation due to four-wave mixing and self-phase modulation strictly limits the total span of systems and the length of the optical repeater spacing. There are proposals to use slightly normal group velocity dispersion fibers (D<0) through the whole system or to arrange the various sections of different dispersion fiber in the cable for suppressing these nonlinearities. However, these strategies are not so easily applied in real systems. A new arrangement of transmission fiber dispersion which easily suppresses these nonlinearities so as to expand the total span of the system or to increase the repeater spacings is proposed. The feasibility of the proposal has been experimentally confirmed.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Optical fiber cables","Fiber nonlinear optics","Nonlinear optical devices","Stimulated emission","Optical mixing","Optical modulation","Repeaters","Proposals","Erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Degradation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fibre lasers","multiwave mixing","optical communication equipment","optical dispersion","optical fibres","optical links","optical losses","repeaters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design arrangement","transmission fiber dispersion","nonlinear degradation","long-distance optical transmission systems","optical repeater amplifiers","erbium-doped fiber amplifier","Er-doped fibre amplifier","zero-dispersion wavelength shifted fibers","four-wave mixing","self-phase modulation","optical repeater spacing","normal group velocity dispersion fibers","repeater spacings","1.5 mum"]}],"doi":"10.1109/50.249903","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6394/00249903.pdf","startPage":"1615","endPage":"1621","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6394","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.249903","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A new design arrangement of transmission fiber dispersion for suppressing nonlinear degradation in long-distance optical transmission systems with optical repeater amplifiers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=249903","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A new design arrangement of transmission fiber dispersion for suppressing nonlinear degradation in long-distance optical transmission systems with optical repeater amplifiers","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/249903/","volume":"11","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4654720","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A new design arrangement of transmission fiber dispersion for suppressing nonlinear degradation in long-distance optical transmission systems with optical repeater amplifiers","sourcePdf":"00249903.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.031089S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"26","articleId":"249903","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":249905,"authors":[{"name":"T.H.

This effect, optical beat interference (OBI), can greatly interfere with the operation of these systems.

With an optical modulation index of m=0.8, a bit-error rate floor of approximately 10/sup -2/ was observed due to OBI, which is consistent with the noise measured by an RF power meter. When m is increased to 1.8, a significant reduction in OBI was observed, and it was possible to achieve transmission at the 10/sup -9/ level with a penalty of only 1.8 dB due to the presence of OBI.<\n<ETX xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">&gt;</ETX>","doi":"10.1109/50.249905","startPage":"1632","publicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Lightwave Technology","pdfPath":"/iel1/50/6394/00249905.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/50.249905","endPage":"1640","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6394","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Operation of a passive optical network with subcarrier multiplexing in the presence of optical beat interference","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/249905/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Oct 1993","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct 1993","displayDocTitle":"Operation of a passive optical network with subcarrier multiplexing in the presence of optical beat interference","volume":"11","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"4654722","dateOfInsertion":"06 August 2002","publicationDate":"Oct. 1993","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Operation of a passive optical network with subcarrier multiplexing in the presence of optical beat interference","sourcePdf":"00249905.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055169S","chronDate":"Oct 1993","isNumber":"6394","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"50","citationCount":"56","articleId":"249905","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1993","subType":"IEEE Journal","lastupdate":"2021-09-10"},{"_id":249907,"authors":[{"name":"Y.
