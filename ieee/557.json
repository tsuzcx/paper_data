Driven by the problems behind the mainstream server-side deduplication schemes, recently there has been a tendency of introducing peer-assisted methods into the deduplication systems. However, this topic is still quite vague at present and lacks thorough research. In this paper, we conduct in-depth and quantitative investigation on the peer-assisted deduplication. Through measurements we observe that the inter-peer duplication accounts for a large proportion of the total duplication, and exhibits strong peer locality. Then based on our observations, we propose PeerDedupe, a novel peer-assisted sampling deduplication approach. Experiments show that PeerDedupe can remove over 98% duplication with each peer coordinating with no more than 5 other peers, and it requires much less server RAM usage than the existing works.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570004/","chronOrPublicationDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5570004/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11526876","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"PeerDedupe: Insights into the Peer-Assisted Sampling Deduplication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PeerDedupe: Insights into the Peer-Assisted Sampling Deduplication","confLoc":"Delft, Netherlands","sourcePdf":"01-02.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061002S","chronDate":"25-27 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5569876","isNumber":"5569954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5569876","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5569954","articleId":"5570004","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5570010,"authors":[{"name":"Yinong Chen","affiliation":["Computer Science and Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA"],"firstName":"Yinong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37281021100"},{"name":"Zhihui Du","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University, China"],"firstName":"Zhihui","lastName":"Du","id":"37401624000"},{"name":"Marcos Garc\u00eda-Acosta","affiliation":["Embedded Computing group, Intel Corporation, Chandler, Arizona, USA"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Garc\u00eda-Acosta","id":"38277892800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7326-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7327-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4081-8","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5570010","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":117,"citationCountPatent":3,"totalDownloads":2999},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Robot sensing systems","Integrated circuits","Service oriented architecture","Driver circuits","Clouds","Cloud computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","robot programming","software architecture","visual programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cloud computing","service-oriented architecture","service-oriented robotics computing","robot as a service","Windows","Linux operating systems","Microsoft Visual Programming Language","graphic composition","RaaS"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["RaaS","SOA","SOC","Service-oriented robotics computing","and robot on Intel architecture"]}],"abstract":"Service-oriented architecture and cloud computing are becoming a dominant computing paradigm, as all major computing companies are supporting this paradigm and more and more organizations are adopting this paradigm. Robotics and service-oriented robotics computing start to joint this new paradigm in the past five years and are now ready to participate in large scale. This paper reports our research on service-oriented robotics computing and our design, implementation, and evaluation of Robot as a Service (RaaS) unit. To fully qualify the RaaS as a cloud computing unit, we have kept our design to comply with the common service standards, development platforms, and execution infrastructure. We also keep the source code open and allow the community to configure the RaaS following the Web 2.0 principles of participation. Developers can add, remove, and modify the RaaS of their own. For this purpose, we have implemented our RaaS on Windows and Linux operating systems running on Atom and Core 2 Duo architectures. RaaS supports programming languages commonly used for service-oriented computing such as Java and C#. Special efforts have been made to support Microsoft Visual Programming Language (VPL) for graphic composition. We are working with high schools to use RaaS and VPL in robotics camps and robotics competitions.","doi":"10.1109/SOSE.2010.44","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth IEEE International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth IEEE International Symposium on Service Oriented System Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5569877/5569889/05570010.pdf","startPage":"151","endPage":"158","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SOSE.2010.44","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5569889","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robot as a Service in Cloud Computing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"4-5 June 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570010/","displayDocTitle":"Robot as a Service in Cloud Computing","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5570010/","publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","conferenceDate":"4-5 June 2010","accessionNumber":"11526974","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robot as a Service in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Nanjing, China","sourcePdf":"4081a151.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109785S","chronDate":"4-5 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5569877","isNumber":"5569889","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5569877","citationCount":"117","xplore-issue":"5569889","articleId":"5570010","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5570107,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas P.

The generator includes two back-to-back full-scale vector controlled 3-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) voltage-source-converters (VSC). A 47th order small-signal analytical wind generator model is developed within MatLab, and a summary of the model structure and controls is given. Model verification is demonstrated for fast and slow system variables employing detailed simulation software PSCAD/EMTDC. An eigenvalue stability study for weak ac networks is presented, and qualitative conclusions about inherent system dynamics and stability characteristics are given. These insights are employed to study the design of an ac voltage controller for weak ac networks. Two alternative controller designs are studied for their potential to enhance system robustness to changes in ac grid strength. Testing on the detailed simulator PSCAD/EMTDC is employed throughout to confirm conclusions from analytical studies.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2053723","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2053723","startPage":"2779","endPage":"2788","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5570058/05570107.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Stability of a Variable-Speed Permanent Magnet Wind Generator With Weak AC Grids","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Stability of a Variable-Speed Permanent Magnet Wind Generator With Weak AC Grids","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","volume":"25","issue":"4","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5570107/","accessionNumber":"11534245","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570107/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Stability of a Variable-Speed Permanent Magnet Wind Generator With Weak AC Grids","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-strachan-2053723-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.059504S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5570058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"139","xplore-issue":"5570058","articleId":"5570107","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-07"},{"_id":5570108,"authors":[{"name":"T.

Multiphase resonant dc-dc converters are studied to step up the dc voltage from individual wind generators to a Medium Voltage (MV) dc bus, and from the MV bus to an HVDC line that will connect the wind farm to shore. Compared to an equivalent ac grid-based wind farm, a dc grid-based wind farm has slightly higher losses, but the weight of the magnetic components and cables is substantially lower. The analysis of operating permanent-magnet synchronous generators at variable and constant dc voltages shows that a fixed dc voltage has marginally higher efficiency than a variable dc voltage. However, using a variable dc voltage gives lower harmonics at the generator facing the voltage-source converter and the dc-dc step-up converter. An aggregated model of multiple parallel connected wind generators is developed and shown to accurately approximate a detailed PSCAD model during varying wind conditions and transients.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2053390","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5570058/05570109.pdf","startPage":"2164","endPage":"2173","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570058","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2053390","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Design of an Offshore Wind Farm Using a MV DC Grid","volume":"25","issue":"4","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5570109/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534249","isJournal":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570109/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Design of an Offshore Wind Farm Using a MV DC Grid","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-robinson-2053390-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.055621S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5570058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"156","xplore-issue":"5570058","articleId":"5570109","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-26"},{"_id":5570110,"authors":[{"name":"Upeka Kanchana Premaratne","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Upeka Kanchana Premaratne received the B.Sc.Eng. degree in electronic and telecommunication engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2005, and is currently pursuing the M.E.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering at the University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada.","He has been a Lecturer at the University of Moratuwa since 2006."]},"firstName":"Upeka Kanchana","lastName":"Premaratne","id":"37394476900"},{"name":"Jagath Samarabandu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Jagath Samarabandu (M'92) received the B.Sc.Eng. degree in electronic and telecommunication engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 1982.

Intrusion detection (ID) is the process of detecting a malicious attacker. It is an effective and mature security mechanism. However, it is not harnessed when securing IEC61850-automated substations. The IDS of this paper is developed by using data collected by launching simulated attacks on IEDs and launching packet sniffing attacks using forged address resolution protocol (ARP) packets. The detection capability of the system is then tested by simulating attacks and through genuine user activity. A new method for evaluating the temporal risk of an intrusion for an electric substation based upon the statistical analysis of known attacks is also proposed.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2050076","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5570058/05570110.pdf","startPage":"2376","endPage":"2383","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2050076","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570058","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Intrusion Detection System for IEC61850 Automated Substations","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570110","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570110/","displayDocTitle":"An Intrusion Detection System for IEC61850 Automated Substations","volume":"25","issue":"4","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534208","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5570110/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Intrusion Detection System for IEC61850 Automated Substations","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-premaratne-2050076-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094442S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5570058","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"85","xplore-issue":"5570058","articleId":"5570110","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570149,"authors":[{"name":"Nikola Tesla","firstName":"Nikola","lastName":"Tesla"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0096-3860"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2330-9431"}],"articleNumber":"5570149","dbTime":"39 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":11,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":984},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570149","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electricity","AC motors","Vibrations","Resistance heating","Lighting","Current measurement"]}],"doi":"10.1109/T-AIEE.1891.5570149","publicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","displayPublicationTitle":"Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers","pdfPath":"/iel5/4763772/5570127/05570149.pdf","startPage":"266","endPage":"319","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/T-AIEE.1891.5570149","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570127","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  1891","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570149/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Jan.  1891","volume":"VIII","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 1891","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Experiments with Alternate Currents of Very High Frequency and their Application to Methods of Artificial Illumination","sourcePdf":"TAIEE-vVIII-n1-22.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.040902S","chronDate":"Jan.  1891","isNumber":"5570127","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4763772","citationCount":"11","articleId":"5570149","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1891","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5570286,"authors":[{"name":"Edwin J.

It is primarily aimed at senior-level undergraduates. The course attempts to familiarize students with hardware-oriented logic design techniques, introduce them to recent technological advances, and provide hands-on experience of the computer hardware. Emphasis is placed on laboratory and project work, individual design and construction experience, the use of modern test equipment, and testing and documenting a system with moderate complexity. It carries five credits, with six lecture hours and six laboratory hours per week during the first six weeks and 20-30 h per week thereafter for students' projects. It demands intensive participation from students and instructors alike, and is continuously updated in response to both technological advances and student feedback. The enrollment has been limited to less than 30 students per quarter. The course has so far been offered for four quarters, and has received very encouraging response from not only students, but also their employers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Project-Oriented Computer Engineerng Course in Digital Electronics and Computer Design","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","doi":"10.1109/TE.1986.5570624","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Education","pdfPath":"/iel5/13/5570615/05570624.pdf","startPage":"157","endPage":"165","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TE.1986.5570624","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570615","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570624","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570624/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"Aug.  1986","chronOrPublicationDate":"Aug.  1986","displayDocTitle":"A New Project-Oriented Computer Engineerng Course in Digital Electronics and Computer Design","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"E-29","issue":"3","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 1986","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Project-Oriented Computer Engineerng Course in Digital Electronics and Computer Design","sourcePdf":"TE-vE-29-n3-9.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071192S","chronDate":"Aug.  1986","isNumber":"5570615","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"13","citationCount":"24","articleId":"5570624","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"1986","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5570677,"authors":[{"name":"S.

The key innovation lays in the robust definition of miniaturized out-of-plane fluidic interconnecting channels (=vias) between stacked layers of microfluidic channels in standard PDMS. Unblocked vias are essential for creating 3-D microfluidic networks. Previous methods either suffered from limited yield in achieving unblocked vias due to residual membranes obstructing the vias after polymerization, or required complicated and/or manual procedures to remove the blocking membranes. In contrast, our method prevents the formation of residual membranes by inhibiting the PDMS polymerization on top of the mold features that define the vias. In addition to providing unblocked vias, the inhibition process also leaves a partially cured, sticky flat-top surface that adheres well to other surfaces and that allows self-sealing stacking of several PDMS layers. We demonstrate the new method by manufacturing a densely perforated PDMS membrane and an LSI 3-D PDMS microfluidic channel network. We also characterize the inhibition mechanism and study the critical process parameters. We demonstrate that the method is suitable for structuring PDMS layers with a thickness down to 10 m.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A High-Yield Process for 3-D Large-Scale Integrated Microfluidic Networks in PDMS","publicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","doi":"10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2067203","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5590382/05570851.pdf","startPage":"1050","endPage":"1057","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2067203","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5590382","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570851","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570851/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"A High-Yield Process for 3-D Large-Scale Integrated Microfluidic Networks in PDMS","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5570851/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11560134","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A High-Yield Process for 3-D Large-Scale Integrated Microfluidic Networks in PDMS","sourcePdf":"jmems-carlborg-2067203-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113491S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5590382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"30","xplore-issue":"5590382","articleId":"5570851","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570853,"authors":[{"name":"Claudia Comi","affiliation":["Department of Structural Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/84/5590382/5570853/5570853-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Claudia Comi received the M.S. degree (with honors) in structural engineering from the Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy, in 1988.","She is a Full Professor of Structural Engineering at the Politecnico di Milano, where she was an Assistant and Associate Professor in the Department of Structural Engineering from 1991 to 2002.

The device's working principle is based on the frequency variations of two resonating beams coupled to a proof mass. Under an external acceleration, the movement of the proof mass causes an axial load on the beams, generating opposite stiffness variations, which, in turn, result in a differential separation of their resonance frequencies. A high level of sensitivity is obtained, owing to an innovative and optimized geometrical design of the device that guarantees a great amplification of the axial loads. The acceleration measure is obtained, owing to a properly designed oscillating circuit. In agreement with the theoretical prediction, the experimental results show a sensitivity of 455 Hz/ ( g being the gravity acceleration) with a resonant frequency of about 58 kHz and a good linearity in the range of interest.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JMEMS.2010.2067437","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5590382","startPage":"1140","endPage":"1152","displayPublicationTitle":"Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/84/5590382/05570853.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Resonant Microaccelerometer With High Sensitivity Operating in an Oscillating Circuit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570853/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5570853/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"A Resonant Microaccelerometer With High Sensitivity Operating in an Oscillating Circuit","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11560128","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"5","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Resonant Microaccelerometer With High Sensitivity Operating in an Oscillating Circuit","sourcePdf":"jmems-corigliano-2067437-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.104775S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"84","isNumber":"5590382","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"84","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5590382","articleId":"5570853","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5570866,"authors":[{"name":"JeongGil Ko","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5/5605291/5570866/5570866-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["JeongGil Ko received the B.Eng. degree in computer science and engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 2007 and the M.S.E. degree in computer science from the Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, in 2009, where he is currently working towards the Ph.D. degree at the Department of Computer Science.","His research interests include wireless medical sensing systems, low-power embedded network system and protocol design, and the deployment of such embedded systems to real environments.","Mr. Ko is a recipient of the Abel Wolman Fellowship awarded by the G.W.C.

We believe that this development is a precursor of a Web of Things, which gives real-world objects and places a Web presence that not only contains a static description of these entities, but also their real-time state. Just as document searches have become one of the most popular services on the Web, we argue that the search for real-world entities (i.e., people, places, and things) will become equally important. However, in contrast to the mostly static documents on the current Web, the state of real-world entities as captured by sensors is highly dynamic. Thus, searching for real-world entities with a certain state is a challenging problem. In this paper, we define the underlying problem, outline the design space of possible solutions, and survey relevant existing approaches by classifying them according to their design space. We also present a case study of a real-world search engine called Dyser designed by the authors.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Real-Time Search for Real-World Entities: A Survey","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2010.2062470","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5605291/05570869.pdf","startPage":"1887","endPage":"1902","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2010.2062470","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5605291","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570869","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570869/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Real-Time Search for Real-World Entities: A Survey","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"98","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5570869/","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11588462","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Real-Time Search for Real-World Entities: A Survey","sourcePdf":"jproc-romer-2062470-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.07687S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5605291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"54","xplore-issue":"5605291","articleId":"5570869","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570877,"authors":[{"name":"Jerome R.

High-accuracy taggers (e.g., based on conditional random fields) rely on well chosen feature functions to ensure that important characteristics of the empirical training distribution are reflected in the trained model. This makes them vulnerable to any discrepancy between training and tagging corpora, and, in particular, accuracy is adversely affected by the presence of out-of-vocabulary words. This paper explores an alternative tagging strategy based on the principle of latent analogy, which was originally introduced in the context of a speech synthesis application. In this approach, locally optimal tag subsequences emerge automatically from an appropriate representation of global sentence-level information. This solution eliminates the need for feature engineering, while exploiting a broader context more conducive to word sense disambiguation. Empirical evidence suggests that, in practice, tagging by latent analogy is essentially competitive with conventional Markovian techniques, while benefiting from substantially less onerous training costs. This opens up the possibility that integration with such techniques may lead to further improvements in tagging accuracy.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/4200690/5623290/05570877.pdf","startPage":"985","endPage":"993","publicationTitle":"IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2075970","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSTSP.2010.2075970","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5623290","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570877","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Part-of-Speech Tagging by Latent Analogy","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Speech recognition","Training","Tagging","Hidden Markov models","Statistical learning","Semantics","Natural language processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Markov processes","natural language processing","speech synthesis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["part-of-speech tagging","language processing","speech processing","empirical training distribution","latent analogy","speech synthesis","global sentence-level information representation","word sense disambiguation","Markovian techniques"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Latent semantic mapping (LSM)","natural language processing (NLP)","part-of-speech (POS) disambiguation","sequence labeling","statistical modeling"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570877/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Part-of-Speech Tagging by Latent Analogy","volume":"4","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5570877/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641667","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Part-of-Speech Tagging by Latent Analogy","sourcePdf":"jstsp-bellegarda-2075970-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.069735S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4200690","isNumber":"5623290","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4200690","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5623290","articleId":"5570877","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570887,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Xu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"p":["Xing Xu (S'09) received the B.Eng. degree in telecommunication engineering from Xidian University, Xi'an, China, in 2004.

VLSI Architecture for Soft-Input Soft-Output Single Tree-Search Sphere Decoding","abstract":"Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless transmission imposes huge challenges on the design of efficient hardware architectures for iterative receivers. A major challenge is soft-input soft-output (SISO) MIMO demapping, often approached by sphere decoding (SD). In this brief, we introduce-to our best knowledge-the first VLSI architecture for SISO SD applying a single tree-search approach. Compared with a soft-output-only base architecture similar to the one proposed by Studer in IEEE J-SAC 2008, the architectural modifications for soft input still allow a one-node-per-cycle execution. For a 4\u00d74 antennas system using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) with order 16, the area increases by 57%, and the operating frequency degrades by 34% only.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570931/","volume":"57","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5570931/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11523329","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"A Scalable VLSI Architecture for Soft-Input Soft-Output Single Tree-Search Sphere Decoding","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Scalable VLSI Architecture for Soft-Input Soft-Output Single Tree-Search Sphere Decoding","sourcePdf":"tcsii-witte-2056014-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.115925S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"8920","isNumber":"5571850","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"8920","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5571850","articleId":"5570931","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5570935,"authors":[{"name":"Hamed F.

WFV is caused by the dependence of the work function of metal grains on their orientations and is analytically modeled in the companion paper (part I). Using this modeling framework, various implications of WFV are investigated in this paper. It is shown that process designers can utilize the proposed models to reduce the impact of WFV by identifying proper materials and fabrication processes. For instance, four types of metal nitride gate materials (TiN and TaN for NMOS devices and WN and MoN for PMOS devices) are studied, and it is shown that TiN and WN result in lower V_th fluctuations. Moreover, device engineers can study the impact of WFV on various types of classical and nonclassical metal-gate CMOS transistors using these analytical models. As an example, it is shown that, for a given channel length, single-fin FinFETs are less affected by WFV compared to fully depleted SOI and bulk-Si devices due to their larger gate area. Furthermore, circuit designers can benefit from the proposed modeling framework that allows straightforward evaluation of the key performance and reliability parameters of the circuits under such V_th fluctuations. For instance, an SRAM cell is analyzed in the presence of V_th fluctuations due to WFV, and it is shown that such variations can result in considerable performance and reliability degradation.","doi":"10.1109/TED.2010.2063270","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5580182/05570935.pdf","startPage":"2515","endPage":"2525","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2010.2063270","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580182","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grain-Orientation Induced Work Function Variation in Nanoscale Metal-Gate Transistors\u2014Part II: Implications for Process, Device, and Circuit Design","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570935","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570935/","displayDocTitle":"Grain-Orientation Induced Work Function Variation in Nanoscale Metal-Gate Transistors\u2014Part II: Implications for Process, Device, and Circuit Design","volume":"57","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11533895","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5570935/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grain-Orientation Induced Work Function Variation in Nanoscale Metal-Gate Transistors\u2014Part II: Implications for Process, Device, and Circuit Design","sourcePdf":"ted-banerjee-2063270-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095298S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5580182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5580182","articleId":"5570935","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570953,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Gao","affiliation":["School of Electrical, Electronic and Computer Engineering, University of Newcastle, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5710472/5570953/5570953-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bin Gao received the B.S. degree in communications and signal processing from Southwest Jiao Tong University, Chengdu, China, in 2005 and the M.Sc. degree (with distinction) in communications and signal processing from Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K., in 2007.

Most existing supervised SCSS methods resort exclusively to the independence waveform criteria as exemplified by training the prior information before the separation process. This poses a significant limiting factor to the applicability of these methods to real problem. Our proposed method does not require training knowledge for separating the mixture and it is based on decomposing the mixture into a series of oscillatory components termed as the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We show, in this paper, that the IMFs have several desirable properties unique to SCSS problem and how these properties can be advantaged to relax the constraints posed by the problem. In addition, we have derived a novel sparse non-negative matrix factorization to estimate the spectral bases and temporal codes of the sources. The proposed algorithm is a more complete and efficient approach to matrix factorization where a generalized criterion for variable sparseness is imposed onto the solution. Experimental testing has been conducted to show that the proposed method gives superior performance over other existing approaches.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TASL.2010.2072500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5710472","startPage":"961","endPage":"976","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/10376/5710472/05570953.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Single-Channel Source Separation Using EMD-Subband Variable Regularized Sparse Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570953/","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5570953/","isJournal":true,"displayDocTitle":"Single-Channel Source Separation Using EMD-Subband Variable Regularized Sparse Features","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11902626","dateOfInsertion":"28 March 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","volume":"19","issue":"4","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Single-Channel Source Separation Using EMD-Subband Variable Regularized Sparse Features","sourcePdf":"tasl-woo-2072500-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095012S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"10376","isNumber":"5710472","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"10376","citationCount":"93","xplore-issue":"5710472","articleId":"5570953","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5570957,"authors":[{"name":"Horng-Horng Lin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, National Chiao Tung University and the QNAP System, Inc., Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5713375/5570957/5570957-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Horng-Horng Lin (S'10) received the B.S. degree in computer science and information engineering and M.S. degree in computer and information science from National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 1997 and 1999, respectively, where he is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree in computer science.","Between 1999 and 2004, he served the National Defense Substitute Service on Enterprise as a Research Assistant with the Institute of Information Science in Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.

However, GMM often suffers from a tradeoff between robustness to background changes and sensitivity to foreground abnormalities and is inefficient in managing the tradeoff for various surveillance scenarios. By reviewing the formulations of GMM, we identify that such a tradeoff can be easily controlled by adaptive adjustments of the GMM's learning rates for image pixels at different locations and of distinct properties. A new rate control scheme based on high-level feedback is then developed to provide better regularization of background adaptation for GMM and to help resolving the tradeoff. Additionally, to handle lighting variations that change too fast to be caught by GMM, a heuristic rooting in frame difference is proposed to assist the proposed rate control scheme for reducing false foreground alarms. Experiments show the proposed learning rate control scheme, together with the heuristic for adaptation of over-quick lighting change, gives better performance than conventional GMM approaches.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570957/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5570957/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11807489","pubMedId":"20840901","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Regularized Background Adaptation: A Novel Learning Rate Control Scheme for Gaussian Mixture Modeling","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Regularized Background Adaptation: A Novel Learning Rate Control Scheme for Gaussian Mixture Modeling","sourcePdf":"tip-lin-2075938-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081686S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5713375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"77","xplore-issue":"5713375","articleId":"5570957","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5570958,"authors":[{"name":"Florian Luisier","affiliation":["Biomedical Imaging Group (BIG), \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5713375/5570958/5570958-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Florian Luisier (M'10) was born in Bagnes, Switzerland, in 1981.

We express the denoising process as a linear expansion of thresholds (LET) that we optimize by relying on a purely data-adaptive unbiased estimate of the mean-squared error (MSE), derived in a non-Bayesian framework (PURE: Poisson-Gaussian unbiased risk estimate). We provide a practical approximation of this theoretical MSE estimate for the tractable optimization of arbitrary transform-domain thresholding. We then propose a pointwise estimator for undecimated filterbank transforms, which consists of subband-adaptive thresholding functions with signal-dependent thresholds that are globally optimized in the image domain. We finally demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art techniques that are specifically tailored to the estimation of Poisson intensities. We also present denoising results obtained on real images of low-count fluorescence microscopy.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2073477","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5713375/05570958.pdf","startPage":"696","endPage":"708","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2073477","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Denoising in Mixed Poisson\u2013Gaussian Noise","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570958","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570958/","displayDocTitle":"Image Denoising in Mixed Poisson\u2013Gaussian Noise","volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11807490","pubMedId":"20840902","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5570958/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Denoising in Mixed Poisson\u2013Gaussian Noise","sourcePdf":"tip-luisier-2073477-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.100221S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5713375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"239","xplore-issue":"5713375","articleId":"5570958","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570959,"authors":[{"name":"Allan Aasbjerg Nielsen","affiliation":["DTU Space National Space Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Denmark"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5713375/5570959/5570959-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Allan A.

The kernel versions are based upon a dual formulation also termed Q-mode analysis in which the data enter into the analysis via inner products in the Gram matrix only. In the kernel version, the inner products of the original data are replaced by inner products between nonlinear mappings into higher dimensional feature space. Via kernel substitution also known as the kernel trick these inner products between the mappings are in turn replaced by a kernel function and all quantities needed in the analysis are expressed in terms of this kernel function. This means that we need not know the nonlinear mappings explicitly. Kernel principal component analysis (PCA), kernel MAF, and kernel MNF analyses handle nonlinearities by implicitly transforming data into high (even infinite) dimensional feature space via the kernel function and then performing a linear analysis in that space. Three examples show the very successful application of kernel MAF/MNF analysis to: 1) change detection in DLR 3K camera data recorded 0.7 s apart over a busy motorway, 2) change detection in hyperspectral HyMap scanner data covering a small agricultural area, and 3) maize kernel inspection. In the cases shown, the kernel MAF/MNF transformation performs better than its linear counterpart as well as linear and kernel PCA. The leading kernel MAF/MNF variates seem to possess the ability to adapt to even abruptly varying multi and hypervariate backgrounds and focus on extreme observations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Kernel Maximum Autocorrelation Factor and Minimum Noise Fraction Transformations","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2076296","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5713375/05570959.pdf","startPage":"612","endPage":"624","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2076296","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713375","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570959","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570959/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","displayDocTitle":"Kernel Maximum Autocorrelation Factor and Minimum Noise Fraction Transformations","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5570959/","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11807491","pubMedId":"20840897","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Kernel Maximum Autocorrelation Factor and Minimum Noise Fraction Transformations","sourcePdf":"tip-nielsen-2076296-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.082103S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5713375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5713375","articleId":"5570959","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570961,"authors":[{"name":"Xingzheng Wang","affiliation":["Biometrics Research Center, Department of Computing, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4233/5610573/5570961/5570961-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Xingzheng Wang received the B.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering and automation from the North China University of Technology, Beijing, China, in 2004, and the M.Sc. degree in mechanical engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, in 2007.

A common comparison framework using both predefined and taught references is defined in the context of the sensory task space robot control approach. The camera, target, and robot modeling errors in the system are considered in the comparison. Both methods are shown to be locally asymptotically stable and locally robust with respect to modeling errors. While the two methods are shown to be comparable and sensitive to the camera and target modeling errors when using predefined references, they are insensitive to these errors when using taught references. However, the system Cartesian and image trajectories and time-to-converge are affected by the camera, target, and robot modeling errors regardless of the type of references. Finally, other fundamental characteristics of the two methods including sensory task space singularity and local minima, motion coupling, and implementation issues are also compared. The comparison results are verified in simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Comparison of Basic Visual Servoing Methods","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","doi":"10.1109/TMECH.2010.2063710","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/3516/6006642/05570968.pdf","startPage":"967","endPage":"983","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMECH.2010.2063710","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6006642","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570968","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570968/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Comparison of Basic Visual Servoing Methods","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"16","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5570968/","dateOfInsertion":"30 August 2011","publicationDate":"Oct. 2011","accessionNumber":"12206813","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Comparison of Basic Visual Servoing Methods","sourcePdf":"tmech-janabisharifi-2063710-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129446S","chronDate":"Oct.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3516","isNumber":"6006642","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3516","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"6006642","articleId":"5570968","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-18"},{"_id":5570970,"authors":[{"name":"Antti Nissinen","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Mathematics, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland"],"firstName":"Antti","lastName":"Nissinen","id":"37545221900"},{"name":"Ville Petteri Kolehmainen","affiliation":["Department of Physics and Mathematics, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland"],"firstName":"Ville Petteri","lastName":"Kolehmainen","id":"37282643900"},{"name":"Jari P.

This instability is especially severe when absolute imaging is considered. With clinical measurements, accurate knowledge about the body shape is usually not available, and therefore an approximate model domain has to be used in the computational model. It has earlier been shown that large reconstruction artefacts result if the geometry of the model domain is incorrect. In this paper, we adapt the so-called approximation error approach to compensate for the modeling errors caused by inaccurately known body shape. This approach has previously been shown to be applicable to a variety of modeling errors, such as coarse discretization in the numerical approximation of the forward model and domain truncation. We evaluate the approach with a simulated example of thorax imaging, and also with experimental data from a laboratory setting, with absolute imaging considered in both cases. We show that the related modeling errors can be efficiently compensated for by the approximation error approach. We also show that recovery from simultaneous discretization related errors is feasible, allowing the use of computationally efficient reduced order models.","doi":"10.1109/TMI.2010.2073716","pdfPath":"/iel5/42/5705633/05570970.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"242","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2010.2073716","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5705633","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Compensation of Modelling Errors Due to Unknown Domain Boundary in Electrical Impedance Tomography","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570970/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Compensation of Modelling Errors Due to Unknown Domain Boundary in Electrical Impedance Tomography","volume":"30","issue":"2","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"31 January 2011","accessionNumber":"11804675","pubMedId":"20840893","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5570970/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Compensation of Modelling Errors Due to Unknown Domain Boundary in Electrical Impedance Tomography","sourcePdf":"tmi-kolehmainen-2073716-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.168649S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5705633","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"91","xplore-issue":"5705633","articleId":"5570970","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-24"},{"_id":5570974,"authors":[{"name":"Nishant Patil","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Stanford, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/5941043/5570974/5570974-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Nishant Patil (S\u201903) received the B.S.

Most impulsive components have a cyclostationary behavior. However, while some of them consist of impulses of considerable amplitude, width, and repetition rates of 50/100 Hz (in Europe), others have lower amplitude and shorter width but repetition rates of up to hundreds of kilohertz. Classical studies compute statistics of the impulse characteristics without taking into account these significant differences. This paper presents a detailed analysis of these noise terms with a clear distinction between their constituent terms.

Moreover, it is sensible to impose a sum-to-one (full additivity) constraint to the estimated source abundances in each pixel. Even though nonnegativity and full additivity are two necessary properties to get physically interpretable results, the use of BPSS algorithms has so far been limited by high computation time and large memory requirements due to the Markov chain Monte Carlo calculations. An implementation strategy that allows one to apply these algorithms on a full hyperspectral image, as it is typical in earth and planetary science, is introduced. The effects of pixel selection and the impact of such sampling on the relevance of the estimated component spectra and abundance maps, as well as on the computation times, are discussed. For that purpose, two different data sets have been used: a synthetic one and a real hyperspectral image from Mars.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2062190","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5607221/05570984.pdf","startPage":"4003","endPage":"4013","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2062190","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5607221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Implementation Strategies for Hyperspectral Unmixing Using Bayesian Source Separation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570984","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570984/","displayDocTitle":"Implementation Strategies for Hyperspectral Unmixing Using Bayesian Source Separation","volume":"48","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11597030","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5570984/","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Implementation Strategies for Hyperspectral Unmixing Using Bayesian Source Separation","sourcePdf":"tgrs-schmidt-2062190-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.102254S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"36","isNumber":"5607221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"33","xplore-issue":"5607221","articleId":"5570984","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570985,"authors":[{"name":"Yuliya Tarabalka","affiliation":["Grenoble Images Speech Signals and Automatics Laboratory (GIPSA-Lab), Grenoble Institute of Technology (INPG), Saint Martin d'Heres, France","Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"Yuliya","lastName":"Tarabalka","id":"37396386300"},{"name":"J\u00f3n Atli Benediktsson","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland"],"firstName":"J\u00f3n Atli","lastName":"Benediktsson","id":"38231866900"},{"name":"Jocelyn Chanussot","affiliation":["Grenoble Images Speech Signals and Automatics Laboratory (GIPSA-Lab), Grenoble Institute of Technology (INPG), Saint Martin d'Heres, France"],"firstName":"Jocelyn","lastName":"Chanussot","id":"37265876800"},{"name":"James C.

Several classifiers are used independently to classify an image. For every pixel, if all the classifiers have assigned this pixel to the same class, the pixel is kept as a marker, i.e., a seed of the spatial region with a corresponding class label. We propose to use spectral-spatial classifiers at the preliminary step of the marker-selection procedure, each of them combining the results of a pixelwise classification and a segmentation map. Different segmentation methods based on dissimilar principles lead to different classification results. Furthermore, a minimum spanning forest is built, where each tree is rooted on a classification-driven marker and forms a region in the spectral-spatial classification map. Experimental results are presented for two hyperspectral airborne images. The proposed method significantly improves classification accuracies when compared with previously proposed classification techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TGRS.2010.2062526","startPage":"4122","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing","pdfPath":"/iel5/36/5607221/05570985.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TGRS.2010.2062526","endPage":"4132","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5607221","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multiple Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification Approach for Hyperspectral Data","pubTopics":[{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570985/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Multiple Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification Approach for Hyperspectral Data","volume":"48","issue":"11","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11597032","dateOfInsertion":"21 October 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multiple Spectral\u2013Spatial Classification Approach for Hyperspectral Data","sourcePdf":"tgrs-tarabalka-2062526-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.049989S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","isNumber":"5607221","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"36","citationCount":"129","articleId":"5570985","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570988,"authors":[{"name":"Jun-Young Lee","affiliation":["Department of Electronics engineering, Myongji University, Yongin si, Gyeonggi, South Korea"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5873561/5570988/5570988-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jun-Young Lee received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Korea University, Seoul, Korea, in 1993, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Daejeon, Korea, in 1996 and 2001, respectively.","From 2001 to 2005, he was a Manager with the Plasma Display Panel Development Group, Samsung SDI, where he was involved in circuit and product development.

A method for controlling the axial position and the rotating speed of the motor is also discussed. First, the development of the AGBM is briefly reviewed. The axial force and the rotating torque are then analyzed theoretically to establish an exact mathematical model for the motor. Finally, a modern control structure is derived to give the AGBM drive good dynamic behavior to make it suitable for practical application in industry. To demonstrate the proposed technique, a surface-mounted four-pole AGBM has been constructed and tested. The experimental results confirm that the motor works stably with the proposed vector control. Moreover, the AGBM can simultaneously provide noncontact levitation and rotation. This makes it an ideal replacement for conventional mechanical bearing motors in equipment used in harsh environments.","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2076309","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873561","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2076309","endPage":"2652","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5873561/05570990.pdf","startPage":"2644","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Analysis and Control of Nonsalient Permanent Magnet Axial Gap Self-Bearing Motor","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570990/","displayDocTitle":"Analysis and Control of Nonsalient Permanent Magnet Axial Gap Self-Bearing Motor","volume":"58","issue":"7","accessionNumber":"12049303","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5570990/","publicationDate":"July 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analysis and Control of Nonsalient Permanent Magnet Axial Gap Self-Bearing Motor","sourcePdf":"tie-nguyen-2076309-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089687S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5570990","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5570998,"authors":[{"name":"Manya V.

Although the regularizer and constraint are usually convex, several particular features of these problems (huge dimensionality, nonsmoothness) preclude the use of off-the-shelf optimization tools and have stimulated a considerable amount of research. In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm to handle one class of constrained problems (often known as basis pursuit denoising) tailored to image recovery applications. The proposed algorithm, which belongs to the family of augmented Lagrangian methods, can be used to deal with a variety of imaging IPLIP, including deconvolution and reconstruction from compressive observations (such as MRI), using either total-variation or wavelet-based (or, more generally, frame-based) regularization. The proposed algorithm is an instance of the so-called alternating direction method of multipliers, for which convergence sufficient conditions are known; we show that these conditions are satisfied by the proposed algorithm. Experiments on a set of image restoration and reconstruction benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithm is a strong contender for the state-of-the-art.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2076294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2076294","startPage":"681","endPage":"695","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5713375/05570998.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713375","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Augmented Lagrangian Approach to the Constrained Optimization Formulation of Imaging Inverse Problems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570998/","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Augmented Lagrangian Approach to the Constrained Optimization Formulation of Imaging Inverse Problems","volume":"20","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","accessionNumber":"11807492","pubMedId":"20840899","publicationDate":"March 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5570998/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Augmented Lagrangian Approach to the Constrained Optimization Formulation of Imaging Inverse Problems","sourcePdf":"tip-afonso-2076294-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.122314S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5713375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"641","xplore-issue":"5713375","articleId":"5570998","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5570999,"authors":[{"name":"Hern\u00e2ni Gon\u00e7alves","affiliation":["Centro de Investiga\u00e7\u00e3o em Ci\u00eancias Geo-Espaciais, Universidade do Porto, Portugal"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5713375/5570999/5570999-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hern\u00e2ni Gon\u00e7alves was born in Porto, Portugal, in 1979.

Although several methods for automatic image registration have been proposed in the last few years, it is still far from a broad use in several applications, such as in remote sensing. In this paper, a method for automatic image registration through histogram-based image segmentation (HAIRIS) is proposed. This new approach mainly consists in combining several segmentations of the pair of images to be registered, according to a relaxation parameter on the histogram modes delineation (which itself is a new approach), followed by a consistent characterization of the extracted objects-through the objects area, ratio between the axis of the adjust ellipse, perimeter and fractal dimension-and a robust statistical based procedure for objects matching. The application of the proposed methodology is illustrated to simulated rotation and translation. The first dataset consists in a photograph and a rotated and shifted version of the same photograph, with different levels of added noise. It was also applied to a pair of satellite images with different spectral content and simulated translation, and to real remote sensing examples comprising different viewing angles, different acquisition dates and different sensors. An accuracy below 1\u00b0 for rotation and at the subpixel level for translation were obtained, for the most part of the considered situations. HAIRIS allows for the registration of pairs of images (multitemporal and multisensor) with differences in rotation and translation, with small differences in the spectral content, leading to a subpixel accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TIP.2010.2076298","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Image Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/83/5713375/05570999.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2010.2076298","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5713375","startPage":"776","endPage":"789","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"HAIRIS: A Method for Automatic Image Registration Through Histogram-Based Image Segmentation","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5570999","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"HAIRIS: A Method for Automatic Image Registration Through Histogram-Based Image Segmentation","chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5570999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"20","issue":"3","publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11807493","pubMedId":"20840895","dateOfInsertion":"14 February 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5570999/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"HAIRIS: A Method for Automatic Image Registration Through Histogram-Based Image Segmentation","sourcePdf":"tip-goncalves-2076298-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.090153S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"83","isNumber":"5713375","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"83","citationCount":"49","xplore-issue":"5713375","articleId":"5570999","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571017,"authors":[{"name":"M.

The control strategy introduces a small change in the switching angles, which varies the duty cycle of the zero-level switching state, controls the neutral point current and, therefore, the neutral point voltage. The decision to vary a given switching angle takes into account the polarity of the output currents and the voltage across the lower dc-link capacitor. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified through extensive simulation studies and experimentally validated using a low power laboratory prototype.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2063718","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRD.2010.2063718","startPage":"258","endPage":"267","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","pdfPath":"/iel5/61/5673376/05571023.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5673376","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Voltage Balancing Control of Three-Level Active NPC Converter Using SHE-PWM","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Voltage Balancing Control of Three-Level Active NPC Converter Using SHE-PWM","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"23 December 2010","volume":"26","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5571023/","accessionNumber":"11704400","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571023/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Voltage Balancing Control of Three-Level Active NPC Converter Using SHE-PWM","sourcePdf":"tpwrd-pulikanti-2063718-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.072831S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"61","isNumber":"5673376","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"61","citationCount":"81","xplore-issue":"5673376","articleId":"5571023","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2022-01-11"},{"_id":5571029,"authors":[{"name":"Jong-Bae Park","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jong-Bae","lastName":"Park","id":"37281005200"},{"name":"Yun-Won Jeong","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yun-Won","lastName":"Jeong","id":"37404233500"},{"name":"Joong-Rin Shin","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Konkuk University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Joong-Rin","lastName":"Shin","id":"37274235500"},{"name":"Kwang Y.

We present a new framework to robustly and efficiently detect abandoned and removed objects based on background subtraction (BGS) and foreground analysis with complement of tracking to reduce false positives. In our system, the background is modeled by three Gaussian mixtures. In order to handle complex situations, several improvements are implemented for shadow removal, quick-lighting change adaptation, fragment reduction, and keeping a stable update rate for video streams with different frame rates. Then, the same Gaussian mixture models used for BGS are employed to detect static foreground regions without extra computation cost. Furthermore, the types of the static regions (abandoned or removed) are determined by using a method that exploits context information about the foreground masks, which significantly outperforms previous edge-based techniques. Based on the type of the static regions and user-defined parameters (e.g., object size and abandoned time), a matching method is proposed to detect abandoned and removed objects. A person-detection process is also integrated to distinguish static objects from stationary people. The robustness and efficiency of the proposed method is tested on IBM Smart Surveillance Solutions for public safety applications in big cities and evaluated by several public databases, such as The Image library for intelligent detection systems (i-LIDS) and IEEE Performance Evaluation of Tracking and Surveillance Workshop (PETS) 2006 datasets. The test and evaluation demonstrate our method is efficient to run in real-time, while being robust to quick-lighting changes and occlusions in complex environments.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Robust Detection of Abandoned and Removed Objects in Complex Surveillance Videos","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2065803","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5977075/05571035.pdf","startPage":"565","endPage":"576","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2065803","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5977075","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571035","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571035/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Robust Detection of Abandoned and Removed Objects in Complex Surveillance Videos","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"41","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5571035/","dateOfInsertion":"18 August 2011","publicationDate":"Sept. 2011","accessionNumber":"12205918","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Robust Detection of Abandoned and Removed Objects in Complex Surveillance Videos","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-tian-2065803-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.097446S","chronDate":"Sept.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5977075","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"112","xplore-issue":"5977075","articleId":"5571035","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571036,"authors":[{"name":"Jianli Chen","affiliation":["Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, China"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5326/5876619/5571036/5571036-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jianli Chen was born in Xiamen, China, on October 15, 1985.

From the computational point of view, the VLSI floorplanning is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we present a hybrid simulated annealing algorithm (HSA) for nonslicing VLSI floorplanning. The HSA uses a new greedy method to construct an initial B*-tree, a new operation on the B*-tree to explore the search space, and a novel bias search strategy to balance global exploration and local exploitation. Experimental results on Microelectronic Center of North Carolina (MCNC) benchmarks show that the HSA can quickly produce optimal or nearly optimal solutions for all the tested problems.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2066560","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part C (Applications and Reviews)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5326/5876619/05571036.pdf","startPage":"544","endPage":"553","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2066560","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5876619","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hybrid Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Nonslicing VLSI Floorplanning","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571036","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571036/","displayDocTitle":"A Hybrid Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Nonslicing VLSI Floorplanning","volume":"41","issue":"4","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12062855","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5571036/","dateOfInsertion":"16 June 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hybrid Simulated Annealing Algorithm for Nonslicing VLSI Floorplanning","sourcePdf":"tsmcc-zhu-2066560-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.067603S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"5326","isNumber":"5876619","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5326","citationCount":"26","xplore-issue":"5876619","articleId":"5571036","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571037,"authors":[{"name":"Ramy H.

The nodes communicate simultaneously over the same narrowband channel and each node uses superposition coding to broadcast independent messages to individual nodes in the network. The goal herein is to find optimal data routes and power allocations to maximize a weighted sum of the data rates injected and reliably communicated over the network. Two instances of this problem are considered. In the first instance, each node uses a fixed power budget, whereas in the second instance the power used by each node is adjustable. For the latter case, two variants are considered: in the first there is a constraint on the power used by each node and in the second there is constraint on the total power used by all nodes. It will be shown that while the instance in which the power of each node is fixed can be cast in the form of an efficiently solvable geometric program (GP), the second instance in which the node powers are adjustable cannot be readily cast in this form. To circumvent this difficulty, an iterative technique is proposed for approximating the constraints of the original optimization problem by GP-compatible constraints. Numerical simulations suggest that this technique converges to a locally optimal solution within a few iterations.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5621048/05571037.pdf","startPage":"6387","endPage":"6399","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2073371","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2073371","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5621048","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571037","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Joint Routing and Resource Allocation via Superposition Coding for Wireless Data Networks","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Wireless communication","Encoding","Numerical models","Transmitters","Broadcasting","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","geometric programming","iterative methods","network coding","radio networks","resource allocation","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["joint routing allocation","joint resource allocation","wireless data networks","K static nodes","narrowband channel","superposition coding","broadcast independent message","power allocation","power budget","geometric program","iterative technique","optimization problem","GP-compatible constraint","numerical simulation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Broadcast channels","cross-layer design","geometric programming","routing"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571037/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Joint Routing and Resource Allocation via Superposition Coding for Wireless Data Networks","volume":"58","issue":"12","htmlLink":"/document/5571037/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11641759","dateOfInsertion":"15 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Joint Routing and Resource Allocation via Superposition Coding for Wireless Data Networks","sourcePdf":"tsp-gohary-2073371-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.134972S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5621048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5621048","articleId":"5571037","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571038,"authors":[{"name":"J.

Our application-specified integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation of the proposed semi-systolic multiplier demonstrates that reduction in time complexity is achieved without imposing hardware overhead. Furthermore, our proposed systolic array shifted polynomial basis (SPB) multiplier has a low time complexity for general irreducible polynomials.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2066994","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6017244/05571040.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2066994","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017244","startPage":"2125","endPage":"2129","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Digit-Level Semi-Systolic and Systolic Structures for the Shifted Polynomial Basis Multiplication Over Binary Extension Fields","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571040","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Digit-Level Semi-Systolic and Systolic Structures for the Shifted Polynomial Basis Multiplication Over Binary Extension Fields","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571040/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"19","issue":"11","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","accessionNumber":"12228013","dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5571040/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Digit-Level Semi-Systolic and Systolic Structures for the Shifted Polynomial Basis Multiplication Over Binary Extension Fields","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-hariri-2066994-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10557S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6017244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"6017244","articleId":"5571040","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571041,"authors":[{"name":"Maged Elkashlan","affiliation":["Wireless and Networking Technologies Laboratory, CSIRO ICT Centre, Marsfield, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Maged","lastName":"Elkashlan","id":"37269057400"},{"name":"Phee Lep Yeoh","affiliation":["School of Electrical and Information Engineering, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Phee Lep","lastName":"Yeoh","id":"37391664100"},{"name":"Raymond H.

We consider two main AF protocols: 1) fixed-gain relaying, which requires partial channel-state information (CSI), and 2) variable-gain relaying, which requires full CSI. Exact closed-form expressions are derived for the moment-generating function of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Our analysis is valid for arbitrary numbers of relays and arbitrary numbers of antennas at the destination. Based on the derived results, we determine the symbol error rate with M-ary phase-shift keying. In addition, we carry out an asymptotic analysis in the high-SNR regime. Our results provide fundamental insight into the impact of the number of antennas on the performance of multiple AF relaying. We explicitly reveal that the diversity order is equal to the sum of two parameters: 1) the number of relays and 2) the number of antennas at the destination.","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2076306","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5613993/05571041.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2076306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613993","startPage":"4602","endPage":"4608","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Exact and Asymptotic SER of Receive Diversity With Multiple Amplify-and-Forward Relays","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571041","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Exact and Asymptotic SER of Receive Diversity With Multiple Amplify-and-Forward Relays","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571041/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"59","issue":"9","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11630035","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5571041/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Exact and Asymptotic SER of Receive Diversity With Multiple Amplify-and-Forward Relays","sourcePdf":"tvt-elkashlan-2076306-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063896S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5613993","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5613993","articleId":"5571041","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571043,"authors":[{"name":"Gerrit J.

A necessary and sufficient frequency-domain condition for string stability is derived, taking into account heterogeneous traffic, i.e., vehicles with possibly different characteristics. For a velocity-dependent intervehicle spacing policy, it is shown that the wireless communication link enables driving at small intervehicle distances, whereas string stability is guaranteed. For a constant velocity-independent intervehicle spacing, string stability cannot be guaranteed. To validate the theoretical results, experiments are performed with two CACC-equipped vehicles.

problem of data and information encoding on DNA bears an increasing interest for both biological and nonbiological applications of biomolecular computing. Recent experimental and theoretical advances have produced and tested to obtain large code sets of oligonucleotides to support virtually any kind of application. In this paper, we have developed an algorithm to design DNA short-word sets based on minimum free energy (MFE) criteria. The MFE constraint is the minimum value among free energies of all the possible structures and the effective approach to control the generation of unexpected secondary structure of DNA sequences may cause error. The algorithm is constructive and directly produces the actual DNA words of the sets, unlike other academic and statistical numbers. According to the previous values, our experimental results can succeed in generating better DNA word sets based on MFE constraint. More importantly, using our results could decrease the emergence of false hybridization reaction, and improve the reliability and the scale of DNA computing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571047/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Dec.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Dec. 2010","accessionNumber":"11772071","pubMedId":"20840907","htmlLink":"/document/5571047/","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"24 January 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"9","issue":"4","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"DNA Word Set Design Based on Minimum Free Energy","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DNA Word Set Design Based on Minimum Free Energy","sourcePdf":"tnb-zhang-2069570-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.074203S","chronDate":"Dec.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"7728","isNumber":"5701726","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7728","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5701726","articleId":"5571047","onlineDate":"13 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571056,"authors":[{"name":"Qing Liu","affiliation":["School of Physics & Information Science, Tianshui Normal University, Tianshui, Gansu, China","School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Qing","lastName":"Liu","id":"37535795400"},{"name":"Lu-ping Xu","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Lu-ping","lastName":"Xu","id":"37292085900"},{"name":"Yong Wang","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, Xi'an, Shanxi, China"],"firstName":"Yong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540236200"},{"name":"Yi-de Ma","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China"],"firstName":"Yi-de","lastName":"Ma","id":"37533404000"},{"name":"Qiang Xie","affiliation":["School of Information Science & Engineering, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu, China"],"firstName":"Qiang","lastName":"Xie","id":"37531988600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7507-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7506-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5571056","dbTime":"15 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":128},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image fusion","Neurons","Pixel","Principal component analysis","Transforms","Artificial neural networks","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","image segmentation","matrix algebra","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","adaptive unit linking pulse coupled neural network","ULPCNN threshold function","null interconnection","nonlinear mapped ULPCNN time matrix","adaptive characteristic statistical judgment","neighbour local character"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image fusion","AULPCNN","Discrete coefficient","Interconnection strength","Time matrix"]}],"abstract":"A novel image fusion algorithm using adaptive Unit-Linking Pulse Coupled Neural Networks (ULPCNN) is put forward.

A novel diagnosis method based on fuzzy CMAC neural network (FCMAC) is proposed in this paper. The proposed fuzzy CMAC neural network has an optimization mechanism to ensure high diagnosis accuracy. The basis functions in the original CMAC are replaced with membership functions of fuzzy theory for smoothing the networks output and increasing the approximation ability in function approximation. A structure of the FCMAC with membership functions of different receptive fields is employed. These receptive fields are determined by the distributions of training data. So, the proposed structure can reduce the memory requirement a great deal in the original CMAC, and keep the same performance with the original CMAC. This proposed neural network has been tested by lots of real fault samples, and its results are compared with those of IEC ratio codes and CMAC neural network, which indicates that the proposed approach has remarkable diagnosis accuracy, and with it multiple incipient faults can be classified effectively.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIE.2010.59","publicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570019/5570817/05571065.pdf","startPage":"221","endPage":"225","doi":"10.1109/ICIE.2010.59","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fault Diagnostic Method of Power Transformers Based on Fuzzy CMAC Neural Network","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fault Diagnostic Method of Power Transformers Based on Fuzzy CMAC Neural Network","isConference":true,"volume":"1","conferenceDate":"14-15 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5571065/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11529499","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571065/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Diagnostic Method of Power Transformers Based on Fuzzy CMAC Neural Network","confLoc":"Beidai, China","sourcePdf":"4080a221.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056031S","chronDate":"14-15 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570019","isNumber":"5570817","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570019","xplore-issue":"5570817","articleId":"5571065","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5571107,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Verd\u00fa","affiliation":["Higher Tech.

However, in order to effectively center the learning process in the student it should be adapted to the student's progress. Adaptive e-learning systems have been proved to be valuable tools, which facilitate this adaptation. QUESTOURnament, an active and competitive Moodle tool, is being re-designed in order to become an adaptive system. One of the first steps in this adaptation is the estimation of the difficulty level of the questions proposed in this environment. This paper describes a solution based on a genetic algorithm with enhanced diversity methods that automatically characterizes the answers to the challenges. The algorithm has been tested with data registered from a contest made in a Telecommunications Engineering course. It finds diverse good solutions, from which several rules can be defined to classify the questions according to their difficulty level.","doi":"10.1109/ICALT.2010.15","startPage":"25","endPage":"29","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570018/5571093/05571107.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALT.2010.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571093","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Diversity-Enhanced Genetic Algorithm to Characterize the Questions of a Competitive e-Learning System","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Biological cells","Classification algorithms","Electronic learning","Adaptive systems","Wheels","Genetics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer aided instruction","genetic algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diversity-enhanced genetic algorithm","competitive e-learning system","technology-enhanced learning systems","adaptive e-learning systems","QUESTOURnament tool","Moodle tool","enhanced diversity methods","question characterization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["adaptive e-learning","competitive e-learning","fitness sharing","genetic algorithms","intelligent tutoring systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571107/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Diversity-Enhanced Genetic Algorithm to Characterize the Questions of a Competitive e-Learning System","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5571107/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","accessionNumber":"11529888","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Diversity-Enhanced Genetic Algorithm to Characterize the Questions of a Competitive e-Learning System","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"4055a025.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070663S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570018","isNumber":"5571093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570018","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5571093","articleId":"5571107","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5571196,"authors":[{"name":"Luca Masud","affiliation":["INDACO Department, Density Design Research Group, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Luca","lastName":"Masud","id":"37546492100"},{"name":"Francesca Valsecchi","affiliation":["INDACO Department, Density Design Research Group, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Francesca","lastName":"Valsecchi","id":"37546492700"},{"name":"Paolo Ciuccarelli","affiliation":["INDACO Department, Density Design Research Group, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Paolo","lastName":"Ciuccarelli","id":"37546488300"},{"name":"Donato Ricci","affiliation":["INDACO Department, Density Design Research Group, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Donato","lastName":"Ricci","id":"37544180300"},{"name":"Giorgio Caviglia","affiliation":["INDACO Department, Density Design Research Group, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy"],"firstName":"Giorgio","lastName":"Caviglia","id":"37546489200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7846-0","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2375-0138"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-6037"}],"articleNumber":"5571196","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":925},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571196","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Data visualization","Context","Visualization","Temperature measurement","Art","Presses","Problem-solving"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["data analysis","data visualisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transformation processes","data-information-knowledge continuum","data visualization","communication tools"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Information Visualization","DIK","Data","Information","Knowledge","Knowledge continuum","Design","transformations","processes"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we suggest a different approach that considers visualizations in the wider domain of communication and defines a model capable of taking into account the context in which visualizations act as communication tools.

By doing this we are able to think about visualization from a multidisciplinary perspective, exploring the role of visualizations in design practice, as artifacts that are used in facing problems of various degrees of complexity and nature.

In many applications, it is now widely used to extract knowledge from the train neural network. The fact that the model obtained with neural network is not understandable in terms of black box model is a brake to their use in this field. To enhance the explanation of ANN, a novel algorithm of regression rules extraction from ANN based on linear intelligent insertion is proposed in this paper. The linear function and symbolic rules is used to instead of ANN, and the rules are generated by the decision tree. The piecewise linear function and symbolic rules can not only ensure the accuracy but also enhance the explanation. Simulation experiments show that the proposed algorithm generates rules are more accurate than the existing algorithms based on decision trees or linear regression.","doi":"10.1109/ICIE.2010.103","startPage":"33","endPage":"36","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570019/5571168/05571217.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIE.2010.103","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571168","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on Rules Extraction from Neural Network based on Linear Insertion","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Approximation algorithms","Least squares approximation","Accuracy","Mechanical engineering","Educational institutions","Piecewise linear approximation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["decision trees","knowledge acquisition","neural nets","piecewise linear techniques","regression analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","nonlinear mapping ability","train neural network","black box model","regression rules extraction","linear intelligent insertion","decision tree","piecewise linear function","linear regression"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Artificial Neural Network","Linear Insertion","symbolic rules","Black Box"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Research on Rules Extraction from Neural Network based on Linear Insertion","isConference":true,"volume":"2","htmlLink":"/document/5571217/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"14-15 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11529650","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on Rules Extraction from Neural Network based on Linear Insertion","confLoc":"Beidai, China","sourcePdf":"4080b033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.054647S","chronDate":"14-15 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570019","isNumber":"5571168","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570019","xplore-issue":"5571168","articleId":"5571217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5571225,"authors":[{"name":"Martin J.

Sketch-based annotations combine the simplicity and immediacy of drawing with the clarity and richness of charting.

This \u201cblended approach\u201d is often based on the adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMS), which are customized in many aspects to match both the teaching style of the university and the needs of teachers and students. More recently, also laboratory experiments, that are integral parts of science and technology classes, have come online. The first generation of Remote Web Laboratories (RWL) has demonstrated the feasibility and the effectiveness of on line experiments, with two major drawbacks: the lack of integration between LMS and RWL and the lack of synchronous interaction among the participants (teacher and students) to the experiment. In this scenario, the paper discusses the principal aspects and the main results about an integration project between the Moodle LMS and the MicroNet RWL at University of Salento, in Italy.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571093","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570018/5571093/05571335.pdf","doi":"10.1109/ICALT.2010.89","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICALT.2010.89","startPage":"310","endPage":"314","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Extending LMS with Collaborative Remote Lab Features","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571335/","displayDocTitle":"Extending LMS with Collaborative Remote Lab Features","htmlLink":"/document/5571335/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11529853","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Extending LMS with Collaborative Remote Lab Features","confLoc":"Sousse, Tunisia","sourcePdf":"4055a310.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.099042S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570018","isNumber":"5571093","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570018","citationCount":"15","xplore-issue":"5571093","articleId":"5571335","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5571337,"authors":[{"name":"Wang Wen-xing","affiliation":["North China University of Water Resources and Electric Power, Zhengzhou, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Wen-xing","id":"38276474900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7507-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7506-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5571337","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":104},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Wavelet transforms","Wavelet analysis","Modulation","Time frequency analysis","Power generation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["electromagnetic interference","OFDM modulation","power plants","signal denoising","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["OFDM technology","power plant","electromagnetic environment","wavelet base function selection","signal communication system","signal noise removal","cosine carriers","multiscale orthogonal wavelet transformation","multicarrier data transmission strategy","data classification subcarrier transmission"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Wavelet bases","OFDM","Carrier transmission on power lines"]}],"abstract":"The electromagnetic environment of the main features in power plants is analyzed, and then the communication system based on OFDM technology was put forward in this paper, the way of selection the wavelet bases function to pass the signal communication system is discussed in the last.

In this paper, we intend to extend these theories to the fractional Fourier transform domain. First, introduce the digital spectrum (the discrete Fourier transform) of nonuniformly sampled signals. And then analyze the digital spectrum of nonuniformly sampled signals in the Fractional Fourier transform domain. Finally, present two examples and make simulations.

Although human intervention in handwriting analysis has been effective, it is costly and prone to fatigue. Hence the proposed methodology focuses on developing a tool for behavioral analysis which can predict the personality traits automatically with the aid of a computer without the human intervention.

Supervised WSD methods are shown to be more effective than other WSD methods with the limitation of the size of manual annotated learning set. On the other hand, Concept graph is a weighted graph with each of its edges representing the relationships between concepts (relevancy of each pair of concepts). In this paper, we propose a method to improve the retrieval and classification performance of documents from different sources by means of concept graph. In our method, some features are initially selected from a training set by applying a well-known feature selection algorithm. Then, by injecting suggested relevant words for each class from the concept graph, a more enriched feature set is produced to apply to the test set. Our experimental results exhibit an improvement of 14.6% and 18.4% (few and more term injection evaluations, respectfully) in classification and also some improvements in retrieval performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Approach for Better Document Retrieval and Classification Performance Using Supervised WSD and Concept Graph","publicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Integrated Intelligent Computing","doi":"10.1109/ICIIC.2010.63","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 First International Conference on Integrated Intelligent Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570013/5571411/05571516.pdf","startPage":"32","endPage":"38","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIIC.2010.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571411","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571516","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571516/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A New Approach for Better Document Retrieval and Classification Performance Using Supervised WSD and Concept Graph","conferenceDate":"5-7 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5571516/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11530471","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A New Approach for Better Document Retrieval and Classification Performance Using Supervised WSD and Concept Graph","confLoc":"Bangalore, India","sourcePdf":"4152a032.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05717S","chronDate":"5-7 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570013","isNumber":"5571411","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570013","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5571411","articleId":"5571516","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5571590,"authors":[{"name":"Xue Jing","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Xue","lastName":"Jing","id":"38277156300"},{"name":"Zhang Jian-jun","affiliation":["Department of Information Science and Technology, Northwest University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Zhang","lastName":"Jian-jun","id":"38275285700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7540-7","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7539-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4110-5","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5571590","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":27,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":3301},"abstract":"Being proposed in 2007, cloud computing has been a hot researching area of computer network technology.

At the same time, the random phase sequence information is rapidly recovered by using related detective algorithm, which largely raises the detective efficiency in the receiver. The simulation results show that the improved SLM could reduce the PAPR more efficiently while the bit error rate (BER) is similar to the one of the typical SLM.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570019/5571632/05571686.pdf","startPage":"69","endPage":"72","publicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","doi":"10.1109/ICIE.2010.306","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIE.2010.306","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571632","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571686","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Improved SLM Algorithm for PAPR Reduction in OFDM","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Peak to average power ratio","Receivers","Bit error rate","Silicon","Transmitters","Fading"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["error statistics","OFDM modulation","random sequences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["improved SLM algorithm","PAPR reduction","OFDM","peak-to-average power ratio","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing system","selected mapping","signal amplitude scaling","system bandwidth","random phase sequence information","detective algorithm","bit error rate","BER"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDM","Peak-to-Average Power Ratio","Selected Mapping","Side Information Detection"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Bioengineering"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571686/","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-15 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Improved SLM Algorithm for PAPR Reduction in OFDM","isConference":true,"volume":"4","htmlLink":"/document/5571686/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11529738","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"14-15 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Improved SLM Algorithm for PAPR Reduction in OFDM","confLoc":"Beidai, China","sourcePdf":"4080d069.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049097S","chronDate":"14-15 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570019","isNumber":"5571632","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570019","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5571632","articleId":"5571686","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5571723,"authors":[{"name":"Hai-bin Zhao","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hai-bin","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37535006800"},{"name":"Chong Liu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Chong","lastName":"Liu","id":"37539136800"},{"name":"Hong Wang","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Hong","lastName":"Wang","id":"37716019300"},{"name":"Chun-sheng Li","affiliation":["School of Mechanical Engineering and Automation, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Chun-sheng","lastName":"Li","id":"37536344600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7507-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7506-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5571723","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":169},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571723","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Feature extraction","Classification algorithms","Probabilistic logic","Biological neural networks","Electrodes","Brain computer interfaces","Electric potential"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["brain-computer interfaces","neural nets","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["ECoG signals","probabilistic neural network","brain-computer interface","feature extraction","band powers","radial basis functions","electrocorticograms"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["brain-computer interface","band powers","probabilistic neural network","Electrocorticograms (ECoG) signals"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIE.2010.26","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570019/5570817/05571723.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","startPage":"77","endPage":"80","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5570817","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIE.2010.26","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Classifying ECoG Signals Using Probabilistic Neural Network","abstract":"Electrocorticograms (ECoG) signals have many potential advantages and gained much attention for use with brain-computer interface (BCI).

In this paper, we revisit one of the popular FTL schemes called FAST, and augment it with new optimization techniques aiming particularly at online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads. As flash memory solid state drives (SSDs) are increasingly adopted for large-scale enterprise-class storage systems, it is important to develop an FTL that can deal with OLTP workloads in a scalable manner, which are characterized by a large number of small, random and skewed IO operations. With the proposed optimization methods such as giving a second chance to valid pages and isolating cold ones, the enhanced FTL, called FASTer, outperforms FAST considerably. In our experiments, FASTer reduced average elapsed time by more than 30 percent, and minimized the fluctuation of response time drastically. Overall, the performance of FASTer was comparable to a page mapping FTL, which tends to consume much more DRAM space to store a large mapping table. This will make the FASTer FTL one of the most cost effective and scalable FTL schemes for OLTP workloads.","doi":"10.1109/SNAPI.2010.9","publicationTitle":"2010 International Workshop on Storage Network Architecture and Parallel I/Os","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Workshop on Storage Network Architecture and Parallel I/Os","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570124/5571750/05571789.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNAPI.2010.9","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571750","startPage":"3","endPage":"12","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FASTer FTL for Enterprise-Class Flash Memory SSDs","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571789","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"FASTer FTL for Enterprise-Class Flash Memory SSDs","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-3 May 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571789/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"3-3 May 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11529332","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5571789/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FASTer FTL for Enterprise-Class Flash Memory SSDs","confLoc":"Incline Village, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"4025a003.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.084318S","chronDate":"3-3 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570124","isNumber":"5571750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570124","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5571750","articleId":"5571789","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5571801,"authors":[{"name":"Sotirios Xydis","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Sotirios","lastName":"Xydis","id":"37391631000"},{"name":"Christos Skouroumounis","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Christos","lastName":"Skouroumounis","id":"37542694000"},{"name":"Kiamal Pekmestzi","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Kiamal","lastName":"Pekmestzi","id":"37283956600"},{"name":"Dimitrios Soudris","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Dimitrios","lastName":"Soudris","id":"37271305000"},{"name":"George Economakos","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"George","lastName":"Economakos","id":"37373878200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7320-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7321-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4076-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"5571801","dbTime":"10 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":73},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Space exploration","Kernel","Discrete cosine transforms","Runtime","Transform coding","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["gradient methods","high level synthesis","logic design"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["high level synthesis exploration","gradient-based pruned searching","design space exploration","compiler-level transformation","architectural-level transformation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["high level synthesis","design space exploration","gradient-based prunning","hybrid exhaustive-heuristic exploration framework"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents a methodology for fast and efficient Design Space Exploration during High Level Synthesis.

As the amount of MVs is explosively increasing, it has become an important task to develop new techniques for effective MV analysis, retrieval, and management. By stimulating the human affective response mechanism, affective video content analysis extracts the affective information contained in videos, and, with the affective information, natural, user-friendly, and effective MV access strategies could be developed. In this paper, a novel integrated system (i.MV) is proposed for personalized MV affective analysis, visualization, and retrieval. In i.MV, we not only perform the personalized MV affective analysis, which is a challenging and insufficiently covered problem in current affective content analysis field, but also propose novel affective visualization to convert the abstract affective states intuitive and friendly to users. Based on the affective analysis and visualization, affective information based MV retrieval is achieved. Both comprehensive experiments and subjective user studies on a large MV dataset demonstrate that our personalized affective analysis is more effective than the previous algorithms. In addition, affective visualization is proved to be more suitable for affective information-based MV retrieval than the commonly used affective state representation strategies.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Affective Visualization and Retrieval for Music Video","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","doi":"10.1109/TMM.2010.2059634","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Multimedia","pdfPath":"/iel5/6046/5571813/05571814.pdf","startPage":"510","endPage":"522","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TMM.2010.2059634","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571813","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571814","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571814/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Affective Visualization and Retrieval for Music Video","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"12","issue":"6","htmlLink":"/document/5571814/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523680","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Affective Visualization and Retrieval for Music Video","sourcePdf":"tmm-tian-2059634-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.125329S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5571813","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"65","xplore-issue":"5571813","articleId":"5571814","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571821,"authors":[{"name":"Gabriele Fanelli","affiliation":["Computer Vision Laboratory, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5571813/5571821/5571821-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Gabriele Fanelli received the Laurea (M.Sc.) degree in computer engineering from the University of Rome Sapienza, Rome, Italy, in 2006, after developing his master's thesis at the Image Coding Group, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden.

For this reason, research on human-machine interaction needs to focus on the recognition and simulation of emotional states, prerequisite of which is the collection of affective corpora. Currently available datasets still represent a bottleneck for the difficulties arising during the acquisition and labeling of affective data. In this work, we present a new audio-visual corpus for possibly the two most important modalities used by humans to communicate their emotional states, namely speech and facial expression in the form of dense dynamic 3-D face geometries. We acquire high-quality data by working in a controlled environment and resort to video clips to induce affective states.

The decoding algorithm, which is referred to hereinafter as interior point decoding, is designed for linear vector channels. The linear vector channels include several practically important channels, such as inter-symbol interference channels and partial response (PR) channels. It is shown that the maximum likelihood decoding (MLD) rule for a linear vector channel can be relaxed to a convex optimization problem, which is called a relaxed MLD problem. The proposed decoding algorithm is based on a numerical optimization technique known as the interior point method with barrier functions. Approximate variations of an interior point method based on the gradient descent and Newton methods are used to solve the relaxed MLD problem. Compared with a conventional joint message-passing decoder, from computer simulations, it is observed that the proposed decoding algorithm achieves better BER performance on PR channels with less decoding complexity in several cases. Furthermore, an extension of the proposed algorithm for high-order modulation formats, such as PAM and QAM, is presented.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2060030","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571870.pdf","startPage":"4905","endPage":"4921","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2060030","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Interior Point Decoding for Linear Vector Channels Based on Convex Optimization","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571870","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Interior Point Decoding for Linear Vector Channels Based on Convex Optimization","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571870/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11523435","volume":"56","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interior Point Decoding for Linear Vector Channels Based on Convex Optimization","sourcePdf":"tit-wadayama-2060030-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.063765S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"18","articleId":"5571870","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5571873,"authors":[{"name":"Shuchin Aeron","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Boston University, Boston, MA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Shuchin Aeron (M'08) received the B.Tech. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India, in 2002, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from Boston University, Boston, MA, in 2004 and 2009, respectively.","Since January 2009, he has been a Postdoctoral Research Scientist with Schlumberger Doll Research (SDR), Cambridge, MA, developing signal processing answer products for borehole acoustic applications.

We consider two settings: output noise models where the noise enters after the projection and input noise models where the noise enters before the projection. We consider two types of distortion for reconstruction: support errors and mean-squared errors. Our goal is to relate the number of measurements, m , and SNR, to signal sparsity, k, distortion level, d, and signal dimension, n . We consider support errors in a worst-case setting. We employ different variations of Fano's inequality to derive necessary conditions on the number of measurements and SNR required for exact reconstruction. To derive sufficient conditions, we develop new insights on max-likelihood analysis based on a novel superposition property. In particular, this property implies that small support errors are the dominant error events. Consequently, our ML analysis does not suffer the conservatism of the union bound and leads to a tighter analysis of max-likelihood. These results provide order-wise tight bounds. For output noise models, we show that asymptotically an SNR of ((n)) together with (k (n/k)) measurements is necessary and sufficient for exact support recovery. Furthermore, if a small fraction of support errors can be tolerated, a constant SNR turns out to be sufficient in the linear sparsity regime. In contrast for input noise models, we show that support recovery fails if the number of measurements scales as o(n(n)/SNR), implying poor compression performance for such cases. Motivated by the fact that the worst-case setup requires significantly high SNR and substantial number of measurements for input and output noise models, we consider a Bayesian setup. To derive necessary conditions, we develop novel extensions to Fano's inequality to handle continuous domains and arbitrary distortions. We then develop a new max-likelihood analysis over the set of rate distortion quantization points to characterize tradeoffs between mean-squared distortion and the number of measurements using rate-distortion theory. We show that with constant SNR the number of measurements scales linearly with the rate-distortion function of the sparse phenomena.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059891","startPage":"5111","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571873.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059891","endPage":"5130","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Theoretic Bounds for Compressed Sensing","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571873/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Information Theoretic Bounds for Compressed Sensing","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5571873/","isStaticHtml":true,"isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11523421","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Information Theoretic Bounds for Compressed Sensing","sourcePdf":"tit-saligrama-2059891-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137243S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"106","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571873","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5571874,"authors":[{"name":"Venkatesan Guruswami","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Venkatesan Guruswami received the Bachelor's degree from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, in 1997, and the Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 2001.","He is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA.

Measurement campaigns, however, show that the Kronecker model results in poor estimates for capacity. Motivated by these observations, a channel model that does not impose a separable structure has been recently proposed and shown to fit the capacity of measured channels better. In this paper, we show that this recently proposed modeling framework can be viewed as a natural consequence of channel decomposition on to its canonical coordinates, the transmit and/or the receive eigenbases. Using tools from random matrix theory, we then establish the theoretical basis behind the Kronecker mismatch at the low-and the high-SNR extremes: 1) sparsity of the dominant statistical degrees of freedom (DoF) in the true channel at the low- SNR extreme, and 2) nonregularity of the sparsity structure (disparities in the distribution of the DoF across the rows and the columns) at the high-SNR extreme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Why Does the Kronecker Model Result in Misleading Capacity Estimates?","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059811","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571876.pdf","startPage":"4843","endPage":"4864","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059811","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571876","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571876/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Why Does the Kronecker Model Result in Misleading Capacity Estimates?","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5571876/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523428","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Why Does the Kronecker Model Result in Misleading Capacity Estimates?","sourcePdf":"tit-raghavan-2059811-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.226425S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"44","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571876","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571878,"authors":[{"name":"Manish Agarwal","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Manish Agawal received the B.Tech. degree in electrical engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur in 2003, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, in 2005 and 2008, respectively.","His areas of interest are wireless communication, information theory, dynamic control, and quantitative finance."]},"firstName":"Manish","lastName":"Agarwal","id":"37283645600"},{"name":"Michael L.

The channel is modeled as a set of parallel independent block Rayleigh fading subchannels with finite coherence time (L channel uses). The transmitter probes a subset of subchannels during each coherence time by transmitting pilot sequences for channel estimation. For each subchannel probed, one bit of feedback indicates whether or not the channel gain exceeds a threshold allowing transmission. Our problem is to optimize jointly the training (both length and power), number of subchannels probed (probing bandwidth), and feedback threshold to maximize the achievable rate (lower bound on ergodic capacity) taking into account the subchannel estimation error. Optimizing the probing bandwidth balances diversity against the quality of the subchannel estimate. We show that the achievable rate increases as S log L, where S is the signal-to-noise ratio, and exceeds the capacity with impulsive signaling (given by S) when L exceeds a (positive) threshold value.

Since an exact capacity expression is difficult to obtain for this case, a tight lower-bound on the mutual information between the input and the output of a MIMO channel has been previously formulated as a design criterion. However, in the previous literature, there has been no analytical expression of the optimum transmit covariance matrix for this lower-bound. Here it is shown that for the general case with channel correlation at both ends, there exists a unique and globally optimum transmit covariance matrix whose explicit expression can be conveniently determined. For the special case with transmit correlation only, the closed-form optimum transmit covariance matrix is presented. Interestingly, the optimal transmitters for the maximum mutual information design and the minimum total mean-square error design share the same structure, as they do in the case with perfect channel state information. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effects of channel estimation errors and channel correlation on the mutual information.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Maximum Mutual Information Design for MIMO Systems With Imperfect Channel Knowledge","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059870","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571881.pdf","startPage":"4793","endPage":"4801","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571881","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571881/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Maximum Mutual Information Design for MIMO Systems With Imperfect Channel Knowledge","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5571881/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523442","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Maximum Mutual Information Design for MIMO Systems With Imperfect Channel Knowledge","sourcePdf":"tit-ding-2059870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.079299S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"40","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571881","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571882,"authors":[{"name":"Florence B\u00e9n\u00e9zit","affiliation":["School of IC, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland"],"bio":{"p":["Florence B\u00e9n\u00e9zit received the Ph.D. degree in 2009 from EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.

The computational complexity of SISO detection often poses significant challenges for practical receiver implementations, in particular in the context of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. In this paper, we present a low-complexity SISO sphere-decoding algorithm, based on the single tree-search paradigm proposed originally for soft-output MIMO detection in Studer (\u201cSoft-output sphere decoding: Algorithms and VLSI implementation,\u201d IEEE J.

The new algorithm incorporates clipping of the extrinsic log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) into the tree-search, which results in significant complexity savings and allows to cover a large performance/complexity tradeoff region by adjusting a single parameter. Furthermore, we propose a new method for correcting approximate LLRs - resulting from sub-optimal detectors - which (often significantly) improves detection performance at low additional computational complexity.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059730","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059730","startPage":"4827","endPage":"4842","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571884.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Soft\u2013Input Soft\u2013Output Single Tree-Search Sphere Decoding","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571884/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Soft\u2013Input Soft\u2013Output Single Tree-Search Sphere Decoding","volume":"56","issue":"10","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11523448","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5571884/","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Soft\u2013Input Soft\u2013Output Single Tree-Search Sphere Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-bolcskei-2059730-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.114046S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"132","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571884","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5571885,"authors":[{"name":"Sergey Loyka","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"p":["Sergey Loyka (M'96\u2013SM'04) was born in Minsk, Belarus.

This paper outlines a number of additional limitations and difficulties of the DMT framework and discusses their implications. Using the recent results on the size-asymptotic (in the number of antennas) outage capacity distribution, the finite-SNR, size-asymptotic DMT is derived for a broad class of fading distributions. The SNR range over which the finite-SNR DMT is accurately approximated by the SNR-asymptotic one is characterized. The multiplexing gain definition is shown to affect critically this range and thus should be carefully selected, so that the SNR-asymptotic DMT is an accurate approximation at realistic SNR values and thus has operational significance to be used as a design criterion. The finite-SNR diversity gain is shown to decrease with correlation and power imbalance in a broad class of fading channels, and such an effect is described in a compact, closed form. Complete characterization of the outage probability (or outage capacity) requires not only the finite-SNR DMT, but also the SNR offset, which is introduced and investigated as well. This offset, which is not accounted for in the DMT framework, is shown to have a significant impact on the outage probability for a broad class of fading channels, especially when the multiplexing gain is small. The analytical results and conclusions are validated via extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Overall, the size-asymptotic DMT represents a valuable alternative to the SNR-asymptotic one.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Finite-SNR Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff via Asymptotic Analysis of Large MIMO Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059570","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571885.pdf","startPage":"4781","endPage":"4792","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059570","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571885","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571885/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Finite-SNR Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff via Asymptotic Analysis of Large MIMO Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5571885/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523449","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Finite-SNR Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff via Asymptotic Analysis of Large MIMO Systems","sourcePdf":"tit-loyka-2059570-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126415S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"20","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571885","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571887,"authors":[{"name":"Joakim Jald\u00e9n","affiliation":["ACCESS Linnaeus Center, Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden","Technical University of Vienna, Institute of Communications and Radio-Frequency Engineering"],"bio":{"p":["Joakim Jald\u00e9n (S'03\u2013M'08) received the M.

Specifically, the work establishes the DMT optimality of a class of regularized lattice decoders, and more importantly the DMT optimality of their lattice-reduction (LR)-aided linear counterparts. The results hold for all channel statistics, for all channel dimensions, and most interestingly, irrespective of the particular lattice-code applied. As a special case, it is established that the LLL-based LR-aided linear implementation of the MMSE-GDFE lattice decoder facilitates DMT optimal decoding of any lattice code at a worst-case complexity that grows at most linearly in the data rate. This represents a fundamental reduction in the decoding complexity when compared to ML decoding whose complexity is generally exponential in the rate. The results' generality lends them applicable to a plethora of pertinent communication scenarios such as quasi-static MIMO, MIMO-OFDM, ISI, cooperative-relaying, and MIMO-ARQ channels, in all of which the DMT optimality of the LR-aided linear decoder is guaranteed. The adopted approach yields insight, and motivates further study, into joint transceiver designs with an improved SNR gap to ML decoding.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059493","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571887.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059493","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","startPage":"4765","endPage":"4780","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"DMT Optimality of LR-Aided Linear Decoders for a General Class of Channels, Lattice Designs, and System Models","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571887","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"DMT Optimality of LR-Aided Linear Decoders for a General Class of Channels, Lattice Designs, and System Models","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571887/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523422","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5571887/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"DMT Optimality of LR-Aided Linear Decoders for a General Class of Channels, Lattice Designs, and System Models","sourcePdf":"tit-jalden-2059493-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.141439S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"67","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571887","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571888,"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Lim","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Hawaii at Manoa, Honolulu, HI, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Fabian Lim (S'10) received the B.

Localization is commonly accomplished through the use of radio communication between mobile devices (agents) and fixed infrastructure (anchors). However, precise determination of agent positions is a challenging task, especially in harsh environments due to radio blockage or limited anchor deployment. In these situations, cooperation among agents can significantly improve localization accuracy and reduce localization outage probabilities. A general framework of analyzing the fundamental limits of wideband localization has been developed in Part I of the paper. Here, we build on this framework and establish the fundamental limits of wideband cooperative location-aware networks. Our analysis is based on the waveforms received at the nodes, in conjunction with Fisher information inequality. We provide a geometrical interpretation of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) for cooperative networks. This approach allows us to succinctly derive fundamental performance limits and their scaling behaviors, and to treat anchors and agents in a unified way from the perspective of localization accuracy. Our results yield important insights into how and when cooperation is beneficial.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059720","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059720","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571889.pdf","startPage":"4981","endPage":"5000","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Localization\u2014 Part II: Cooperative Networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Localization\u2014 Part II: Cooperative Networks","volume":"56","issue":"10","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5571889/","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523425","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571889/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Localization\u2014 Part II: Cooperative Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-shen-2059720-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.129172S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"575","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571889","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5571890,"authors":[{"name":"Xiaohu Shang","affiliation":["Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA","Department of Electrical Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Xiaohu Shang (S'07\u2013M'09) received the B.

Hybrid LDPC codes are characterized by an irregular connectivity profile and heterogeneous orders of the symbols in the codeword. It is shown in particular that the class of hybrid LDPC codes can be asymptotically characterized and optimized using density evolution (DE) framework, and a technique to maximize the minimum distance of the code is presented. Numerical assessment of hybrid LDPC code performances is provided, by comparing them to protograph-based and multiedge-type (MET) LDPC codes. Hybrid LDPC codes are shown to allow to achieve an interesting tradeoff between good error-floor performance and good waterfall region with nonbinary coding techniques.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059910","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571892.pdf","startPage":"5314","endPage":"5334","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059910","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Nonbinary Hybrid LDPC Codes","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Nonbinary Hybrid LDPC Codes","volume":"56","issue":"10","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11523431","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5571892/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571892/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Nonbinary Hybrid LDPC Codes","sourcePdf":"tit-sassatelli-2059910-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.118249S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571892","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5571893,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe Jacquet","affiliation":["INRIA, Le Chesnay, France"],"firstName":"Philippe","lastName":"Jacquet","id":"37283313400"},{"name":"Bernard Mans","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Bernard","lastName":"Mans","id":"37299604200"},{"name":"Georgios Rodolakis","affiliation":["Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia"],"firstName":"Georgios","lastName":"Rodolakis","id":"37320742900"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5571893","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":74,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":892},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Upper bound","Mobile communication","Mobile computing","Delay","Trajectory","Motion segmentation","Routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mobile radio","random processes","telecommunication network routing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information propagation speed","delay tolerant networks","mobile networks","end-to-end multihop paths","generic theoretical upper bounds","intermittent connected networks","communication routing algorithm","specific mobility models","2D networks","random waypoint-like models","3D networks","1D networks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Delay tolerant networks (DTNs)","information propagation speed","intermittently connected networks (ICNs)","mobile networks"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Propagation Speed in Mobile and Delay Tolerant Networks","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059830","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","endPage":"5015","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571893.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059830","startPage":"5001","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571893","abstract":"The goal of this paper is to increase our understanding of the fundamental performance limits of mobile and Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), where end-to-end multihop paths may not exist and communication routes may only be available through time and mobility. We use analytical tools to derive generic theoretical upper bounds for the information propagation speed in large scale mobile and intermittently connected networks. In other words, we upper-bound the optimal performance, in terms of delay, that can be achieved using any routing algorithm. We then show how our analysis can be applied to specific mobility models to obtain specific analytical estimates. In particular, in 2-D networks, when nodes move at a maximum speed v and their density is small (the network is sparse and asymptotically almost surely disconnected), we prove that the information propagation speed is upper bounded by (1 + O(v\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n))v in random waypoint-like models, while it is upper bounded by O(\u221avvv) for other mobility models (random walk, Brownian motion). We also present simulations that confirm the validity of the bounds in these scenarios.

We show that node spatial heterogeneity has the ability to drastically improve upon existing scaling laws established under the assumption that nodes are identical and uniformly visit the entire network area. In particular, we consider the situation in which each node moves around its own home-point according to a restricted mobility process which results into a spatial stationary distribution that decays as a power law of exponent \u03b4 with the distance from the home-point. For such restricted mobility model, we propose a novel class of scheduling and routing schemes, which significantly outperforms all delay-throughput results previously obtained in the case of identical nodes. In particular, for \u03b4 = 2 it is possible to achieve almost constant delay and almost constant per-node throughput (except for a polylogarithmic factor) as the number of nodes increases, even without resorting to sophisticated coding or signal processing techniques.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571898/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5571898/","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11523443","volume":"56","issue":"10","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Restricted Mobility Improves Delay-Throughput Tradeoffs in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Restricted Mobility Improves Delay-Throughput Tradeoffs in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks","sourcePdf":"tit-leonardi-2059510-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.071424S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"52","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571898","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5571900,"authors":[{"name":"Yuan Shen","affiliation":["Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems (LIDS), Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Shen","id":"37400482800"},{"name":"Moe Z.

The coming years will see the emergence of location-aware networks with submeter accuracy, relying on accurate range measurements provided by wide bandwidth transmissions. In this two-part paper, we determine the fundamental limits of localization accuracy of wideband wireless networks in harsh multipath environments. We first develop a general framework to characterize the localization accuracy of a given node here and then extend our analysis to cooperative location-aware networks in Part II. In this paper, we characterize localization accuracy in terms of a performance measure called the squared position error bound (SPEB), and introduce the notion of equivalent Fisher information (EFI) to derive the SPEB in a succinct expression. This methodology provides insights into the essence of the localization problem by unifying localization information from individual anchors and that from a priori knowledge of the agent's position in a canonical form. Our analysis begins with the received waveforms themselves rather than utilizing only the signal metrics extracted from these waveforms, such as time-of-arrival and received signal strength. Hence, our framework exploits all the information inherent in the received waveforms, and the resulting SPEB serves as a fundamental limit of localization accuracy.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2060110","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571900.pdf","startPage":"4956","endPage":"4980","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2060110","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Localization\u2014 Part I: A General Framework","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571900","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571900/","displayDocTitle":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Localization\u2014 Part I: A General Framework","volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523445","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamental Limits of Wideband Localization\u2014 Part I: A General Framework","sourcePdf":"tit-shen-2060110-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057918S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"95","articleId":"5571900","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571908,"authors":[{"name":"Behrooz Mashadi","affiliation":["Automotive Engineering Department, Iran University of Science and Technology, Tehran, Iran"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/25/5571765/5571908/5571908-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Behrooz Mashadi received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in mechanical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, and the Ph.D. degree from Leeds University, Leeds, U.K., in 1996.","Since then, he has been engaged in the automotive industry.

The new PSD is a mechanism that allows operation in two different power-split modes through locking/unlocking of two clutches. In one mode, the PSD operates similar to a standard planetary gear unit, and in the other mode, it works the same as a compound planetary set. A well-known analogous system is the Toyota Hybrid System (THS) and is used for comparison purposes. It is demonstrated that by the new system, the transmission losses are reduced by a considerable extent, and thus, the efficiency is improved. A controller is designed based on fuzzy logic, which receives the battery state of charge (SOC), the vehicle speed, and the power that is requested at the wheels to coordinate each component in such a way as to optimize the entire system efficiency. A numerical optimization algorithm is applied to sustain the SOC in high regions and shift engine operating points to higher efficiency regions. Simulation results demonstrate notable improvements in fuel economy and performance characteristics.","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/25/5571765/05571908.pdf","startPage":"3223","endPage":"3232","doi":"10.1109/TVT.2010.2049870","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVT.2010.2049870","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571765","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dual-Mode Power-Split Transmission for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","pubTopics":[{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Aerospace"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571908/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Dual-Mode Power-Split Transmission for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","htmlLink":"/document/5571908/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Sept. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11523628","isJournal":true,"volume":"59","issue":"7","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dual-Mode Power-Split Transmission for Hybrid Electric Vehicles","sourcePdf":"tvt-mashadi-2049870-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.05784S","chronDate":"Sept.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"25","isNumber":"5571765","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"25","citationCount":"99","xplore-issue":"5571765","articleId":"5571908","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5571910,"authors":[{"name":"Michael Lentmaier","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA","Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"Lentmaier","id":"37283339900"},{"name":"Arvind Sridharan","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA","Seagate Technologies, Inc., Longmont, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Arvind","lastName":"Sridharan","id":"37274964400"},{"name":"Daniel J.

We show that using the NLD for MIMO systems has considerable deficiencies in terms of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. Unlike the case of maximum-likelihood decoding, in this case, even the perfect lattice space-time codes which have the nonvanishing determinant property cannot achieve the optimal diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. Indeed, we show that in the case of NLD, when we fix the underlying lattice, all the codes based on full-rate lattices have the same diversity-multiplexing tradeoff as V-BLAST. Also, we derive a lower bound on the symbol error probability of the NLD for the fixed-rate MIMO systems (with equal numbers of receive and transmit antennas). This bound shows that asymptotically, the NLD has an unbounded loss in terms of the required SNR, compared to the maximum likelihood decoding.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059630","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571912.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059630","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","startPage":"4820","endPage":"4826","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Limitations of the Naive Lattice Decoding","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571912","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"On the Limitations of the Naive Lattice Decoding","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571912/","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5571912/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523417","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Limitations of the Naive Lattice Decoding","sourcePdf":"tit-khandani-2059630-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.057041S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571912","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5571914,"authors":[{"name":"Aleksandar Jovi\u010di\u0107","affiliation":["Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, Bridgwater, NJ, USA"],"firstName":"Aleksandar","lastName":"Jovi\u010di\u0107","id":"37547910600"},{"name":"Hua Wang","affiliation":["Qualcomm Flarion Technologies, Bridgwater, NJ, USA","127 Coordinated Sciences Laboratory MC-228, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Hua","lastName":"Wang","id":"37280096500"},{"name":"Pramod Viswanath","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, USA","127 Coordinated Sciences Laboratory MC-228, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Urbana, IL"],"firstName":"Pramod","lastName":"Viswanath","id":"37271448800"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0018-9448"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1557-9654"}],"articleNumber":"5571914","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":418},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Information Theory Society","url":"http://www.itsoc.org/"}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571914","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Receivers","Interference","Transmitters","Power control","Signal to noise ratio","Peer to peer computing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["encoding","power control","radio networks","radiofrequency interference","telecommunication congestion control","telecommunication network management","wide area networks"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network interference management","building-block models","interference-limited wireless networks","peer-to-peer network design","wide area network design","long-range transmitter","short-range transmissions","long-range receiver","degree-of-freedom region","multilevel superposition coding","power control strategy"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Gaussian interference channel","generalized degrees of freedom","interference network","many-to-one","one-to-many"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059637","endPage":"4955","startPage":"4941","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571914.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059637","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On Network Interference Management","abstract":"We study two building-block models of interference-limited wireless networks, motivated by the problem of joint Peer-to-Peer and Wide Area Network design.

By analyzing the detection error probability expression for the optimized STBC, it is shown that for QAM signaling, the maximum diversity gain for such a system is N - M + 1. The minimum probability of error STBC design is then extended to systems in which the transmission spans L independent realizations from a block fading channel model, and a (multiblock) linear MMSE receiver is employed. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the code are obtained, and a systematic design method for generating codes that satisfy these conditions is presented. The detection error probability and diversity gain of this optimized linear multiblock transceiver are analyzed. It is proved that the error probability decreases with L, and it is shown numerically that the diversity gain increases with L. Thus, if the corresponding latency can be accommodated, for sufficiently large L an optimally designed multiblock system with a linear receiver can exploit the temporal diversity provided by the block-fading channel and achieve higher diversity gain than that of any single-block system of the same symbol rate with a maximum likelihood (ML) receiver. The optimized multiblock linear system achieves this diversity at a substantially lower computational cost. In fact, the structure of the optimal codes can be exploited to significantly reduce the cost of the multiblock linear receiver.","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059639","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571915.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059639","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","startPage":"4802","endPage":"4819","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Diversity Analysis and Design of Space\u2013Time Multiblock Codes for MIMO Systems Equipped With Linear MMSE Receivers","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571915","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Diversity Analysis and Design of Space\u2013Time Multiblock Codes for MIMO Systems Equipped With Linear MMSE Receivers","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571915/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"56","issue":"10","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523419","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5571915/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Diversity Analysis and Design of Space\u2013Time Multiblock Codes for MIMO Systems Equipped With Linear MMSE Receivers","sourcePdf":"tit-wong-2059639-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.126393S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571915","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571917,"authors":[{"name":"Shuangqing Wei","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Shuangqing Wei (S\u201999\u2013M\u201903) received the B.E. and M.S. degrees in electronic engineering from Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 1995 and 1998, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in 2003.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge.

In particular, a large amount of work has focused on analyzing the variation of the complex envelope of the transmitted signal and on designing methods to minimize this variation. In this paper, it is established that the complex envelope of a bandlimited uncoded OFDM signal converges weakly to a Gaussian random process as the number of subcarriers goes to infinity. This shows that the properties of the OFDM signal will asymptotically approach those of a Gaussian random process over any finite time interval. The convergence proof is then extended to two important cases, namely, coded OFDM systems and systems with an unequal power allocation across subcarriers.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","pdfPath":"/iel5/18/5571829/05571917.pdf","startPage":"4893","endPage":"4904","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Information Theory","doi":"10.1109/TIT.2010.2059550","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2010.2059550","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571829","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5571917","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Convergence of the Complex Envelope of Bandlimited OFDM Signals","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["OFDM","Convergence","Random processes","Error correction","Wireless communication","Baseband","Encoding"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gaussian processes","OFDM modulation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bandlimited OFDM signals","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","transmitted signal","Gaussian random process","OFDM systems","power allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Convergence","extreme value theory","Gaussian random process","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)","peak-to-mean envelope power ratio"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571917/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Convergence of the Complex Envelope of Bandlimited OFDM Signals","volume":"56","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5571917/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11523410","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Convergence of the Complex Envelope of Bandlimited OFDM Signals","sourcePdf":"tit-wei-2059550-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.162655S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"18","isNumber":"5571829","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"18","citationCount":"70","xplore-issue":"5571829","articleId":"5571917","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571946,"authors":[{"name":"C.

One such solution is the multicore approach, i.e., using multiple simple cores that enable higher performance than wide superscalar processors, provided that the workload can exploit the parallelism. Another emerging alternative is the use of customized designs (accelerators) at different levels within the system. These are specialized functional units integrated with the core, specialized cores, attached processors, or attached appliances. The design tradeoff is quite compelling because current processor chips have billions of transistors, but they cannot all be activated or switched at the same time at high frequencies. Specialized designs provide increased power efficiency but cannot be used as general-purpose compute engines. Therefore, architects trade area for power efficiency by placing in the design additional units that are known to be active at different times. The resulting system is a heterogeneous architecture, with the potential of specialized execution that accelerates different workloads. While designing and building such hardware systems is attractive, writing and porting software to a heterogeneous platform is even more challenging than parallelism for homogeneous multicore systems. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy that allows us to define classes of accelerators, with the goal of focusing on a small set of programming models for accelerators. We discuss several types of currently popular accelerators and identify challenges to exploiting such accelerators in current software stacks. This paper serves as a guide for both hardware designers by providing them with a view on how software best exploits specialization and software programmers by focusing research efforts to address parallelism and heterogeneity.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571946/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2010","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","volume":"54","issue":"5","displayDocTitle":"A taxonomy of accelerator architectures and their programming models","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A taxonomy of accelerator architectures and their programming models","sourcePdf":"jrd-cascaval-2059721-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.019952S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","isNumber":"5571943","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"9","articleId":"5571946","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IBM","_value":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5571950,"authors":[{"name":"S.

OpenCL is still under development, and it is not clear whether OpenCL has any advantages over other frameworks aside from portability. The purpose of our project was to define evaluation criteria, empirically evaluate OpenCL as a programming framework using evaluation criteria (e.g., performance, productivity, and portability criteria), define and implement parallel primitives in OpenCL, and demonstrate how the use of the implemented parallel primitives can have benefits for our target applications. Parallel primitive library APIs are defined to implement parallel algorithms in OpenCL, and a set of data- and task-parallel primitives is implemented and incorporated in the target applications. Multicore central processing units, the Cell Broadband Engine\u00ae (Cell/B.E.\u00ae), and graphics processing units are used as target platforms, and digital TV applications are used to evaluate usefulness of OpenCL. Preliminary results show that parallel primitives can be one of the ways to improve application performance and programmer productivity with respect to OpenCL while still maintaining software portability.","doi":"10.1147/JRD.2010.2062050","publicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","displayPublicationTitle":"IBM Journal of Research and Development","pdfPath":"/iel5/5288520/5571943/05571950.pdf","startPage":"7:1","endPage":"7:14","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1147/JRD.2010.2062050","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571943","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"OpenCL and parallel primitives for digital TV applications","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IBM","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"13 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"OpenCL and parallel primitives for digital TV applications","volume":"54","issue":"5","dateOfInsertion":"13 September 2010","isJournal":true,"publicationDate":"Sept.-Oct. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5571950/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"OpenCL and parallel primitives for digital TV applications","sourcePdf":"jrd-yeo-2062050-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.044262S","chronDate":"Sept.-Oct.  2010","isNumber":"5571943","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5288520","citationCount":"4","articleId":"5571950","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IBM","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5571980,"authors":[{"name":"Lisheng Wei","affiliation":["Anhui University of Technology and Science, Wuhu City, Anhui Province, P.

However, high peak-to-average ratio (PAPR) degrades the system performance. Applying the signal space expansion into the signal selection scheme, PAPR reduction could be implemented in OFDM systems. In this paper, a selected mapping (SLM) applied scheme using signal space expansion is proposed. In the scheme, a specific rule is designed to scramble the data sequence for PAPR reduction. The data sequence can be completely extracted at the receiver without any side information. Hence, the scheme can be implemented to reduce PAPR and to avoid bit error rate (BER) degradation in the OFDM system. Then, the numerical results are given to evaluate the performance on PAPR reduction and BER in the OFDM system. The result shows BER performance with the proposed SLM applied scheme is better than that with the ordinary SLM scheme.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Selected mapping applied scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM communication systems","publicationTitle":"The 6th International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","displayPublicationTitle":"The 6th International Conference on Networked Computing and Advanced Information Management","pdfPath":"/iel5/5562236/5572041/05572157.pdf","startPage":"752","endPage":"755","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5572041","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572157","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572157/","chronOrPublicationDate":"16-18 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Selected mapping applied scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM communication systems","conferenceDate":"16-18 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5572157/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11530902","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Selected mapping applied scheme for PAPR reduction in OFDM communication systems","confLoc":"Seoul, Korea (South)","sourcePdf":"146NCMISIS6278001Ok.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.069236S","chronDate":"16-18 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562236","isNumber":"5572041","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562236","xplore-issue":"5572041","articleId":"5572157","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"AICIT","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5572241,"authors":[{"name":"Zhi-Ming Chen","affiliation":["Electronic Science Department, Huizhou University, Guangdong 516007, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Ming","lastName":"Chen","id":"37089088990"},{"name":"Jian-Zhong Cao","affiliation":["Electronic Science Department, Huizhou University, Guangdong 516007, China"],"firstName":"Jian-Zhong","lastName":"Cao","id":"37535893100"},{"name":"Jin-Qiu Huang","affiliation":["Electronic Science Department, Huizhou University, Guangdong 516007, China"],"firstName":"Jin-Qiu","lastName":"Huang","id":"37087341742"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-7-8946-3104-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6263-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-8946-3104-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"5572241","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":105},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572241","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel 3D reconstruction algorithm based on hybrid immune particle swarm optimization","abstract":"Shape from shading (SFS) is an important method for such fields as surface measurement of an object.

Elman neural network, which has good dynamic property, quick approximate rate and high prediction accuracy, is adopted to estimate battery SOC. First, the training data and the test data required in the estimation operation are collected using the ADVISOR software, which include the attributes, such as the battery current, voltage, required power and SOC. Then, to avoid attributes in greater numeric ranges dominate those in smaller numeric ranges and the numerical difficulties during the calculation, data scaling should be operated before applying the Elman neural network. Finally, compared to the BP neural network method, simulation experiments have been carried on. The results indicate that, under different drive cycles, using Elman neural network can more accurately approximate the actual SOC value and then obtain a better estimation performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572641/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11572373","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5572641/","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Battery State-Of-Charge estimation in Electric Vehicle using Elman neural network method","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Battery State-Of-Charge estimation in Electric Vehicle using Elman neural network method","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"11511907.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062185S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562463","isNumber":"5571954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562463","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5571954","articleId":"5572641","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Association of Aut","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5572703,"authors":[{"name":"Han Li-qiang","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Measurement and Control, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China","College of Electrical Engineering, Yanshan university Qinhuangdao, Qinhuangdao, China"],"firstName":"Han","lastName":"Li-qiang","id":"38274444700"},{"name":"Wang Qi","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Measurement and Control, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Wang","lastName":"Qi","id":"37364670900"},{"name":"Shida Katsunori","affiliation":["Department of Automatic Measurement and Control, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin, China"],"firstName":"Shida","lastName":"Katsunori","id":"37540674800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7507-0","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7506-3","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5572703","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":532},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572703","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Atmospheric modeling","Optical fiber communication","Adaptive optics","Optical receivers","Indexes","Laser beams","Integrated optics"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["atmospheric turbulence","optical communication","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["outage probability","free space optical communication","atmosphere turbulence","closed-form expressions","lognormal probability ditribution"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Free space optical communication","Outage probability","atmospheric turbulence","Scintillation index"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ICIE.2010.321","endPage":"130","startPage":"127","publicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 WASE International Conference on Information Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570019/5571632/05572703.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIE.2010.321","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571632","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Outage Probability of Free Space Optical Communication over Atmosphere Turbulence","abstract":"Free space optical communications have potential applications in the future global communication network.

To confront this problem in embedded computation either in the form of programmable processors or FSMD (Finite-State Machine with Datapath) architectures, the use of customized loop controllers has been suggested. In this paper, a thorough examination of zero-cycle overhead loop controllers applicable to perfect loop nests operating on multi-dimensional data is presented. The design of such loop controllers is formalized by the introduction of a hardware algorithm that fully automates this task for the spectrum of behavioral as well as generated register-transfer level architectures. The presented algorithm would prove beneficial in the field of high-level synthesis of architectures for data-intensive processing. It is also shown that the proposed loop controllers can be efficiently utilized for supporting generalized loop structures such as imperfect loop nests. The performance characteristics (cycle time, chip area) of the proposed architectures have been evaluated for FPGA target implementations. It is shown that maximum clock frequencies of above 230MHz with low logic footprints of about 1.4% of the overall logic resources can be achieved for supporting up to 8 nested loops with 16-bit indices on a modestly-sized Xilinx Virtex-5 device.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.63","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570021/5571793/05572755.pdf","startPage":"35","endPage":"40","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571793","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.63","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient Hardware Looping Units for FPGAs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572755/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient Hardware Looping Units for FPGAs","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5572755/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11529368","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient Hardware Looping Units for FPGAs","confLoc":"Lixouri, Greece","sourcePdf":"4076a035.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053708S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570021","isNumber":"5571793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570021","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5571793","articleId":"5572755","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5572760,"authors":[{"name":"Nicolas Sklavos","affiliation":["Informatics & MM Department Branch of Pyrgos, Technological Educational Institute of Patras, Pyrgos, Greece"],"firstName":"Nicolas","lastName":"Sklavos","id":"37272112600"},{"name":"Paris Kitsos","affiliation":["Computer Science, Hellenic Open University, Greece"],"firstName":"Paris","lastName":"Kitsos","id":"37272407300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7320-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7321-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4076-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"5572760","dbTime":"35 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Computer architecture","Hardware","NIST","Cryptography","Throughput"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","field programmable gate arrays","VLSI"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["BLAKE HASH function family","FPGA","cryptography","protocols","security mechanisms","NIST standard","BLAKE hash functions family","VLSI architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["BLAKE","SHA-3","FPGA","VLSI","Hashing","Security"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572760","abstract":"Hash functions form an important category of cryptography, which is widely used in a great number of protocols and security mechanisms.

The paper presents a front-end ASIC implementation for an adaptive control unit (ACU) for a reconfigurable ADC. The control unit is based on an adaptive algorithm that changes either the converter resolution or sampling-rate within an observation interval. Switching activity on the digital ADC output is monitored, evaluated and compared to threshold values. The resolution (or sampling-rate) is increased when the switching activity is high and decreased when the activity is low. Since the adaptive control unit is simple, it is suitable for most Nyquist-rate ADCs especially for area-limited portable devices. The module is synthesized using AMS 0.35\u03bcm/3.3V CMOS standard libraries. In adaptive resolution ADC application, the ACU occupies only 677 equivalent 2-input NAND gates and consumes only 1.01mW. Meanwhile, for adaptive sampling-rate ADC, the gate density is 703 and power consumption is 2.22mW. The results show that the area complexity of the ACU is small and consumes minimum power. For this reason, the ACU is suitable for adaptive ADC implementation targeting low power wireless applications.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.79","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570021/5571793/05572767.pdf","startPage":"179","endPage":"184","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.79","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"ASIC Design of an Adaptive Control Unit for Reconfigurable Analog-to-Digital Converters","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572767","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572767/","displayDocTitle":"ASIC Design of an Adaptive Control Unit for Reconfigurable Analog-to-Digital Converters","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11529381","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5572767/","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"ASIC Design of an Adaptive Control Unit for Reconfigurable Analog-to-Digital Converters","confLoc":"Lixouri, Greece","sourcePdf":"4076a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072475S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570021","isNumber":"5571793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570021","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5571793","articleId":"5572767","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5572769,"authors":[{"name":"Michael H\u00fcbner","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Information Processing Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Michael","lastName":"H\u00fcbner","id":"37300247900"},{"name":"Joachim Meyer","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Information Processing Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Joachim","lastName":"Meyer","id":"37405594500"},{"name":"Oliver Sander","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Information Processing Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Oliver","lastName":"Sander","id":"37528638900"},{"name":"Lars Braun","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Information Processing Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"Lars","lastName":"Braun","id":"37528761100"},{"name":"J\u00fcrgen Becker","affiliation":["Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute for Information Processing Technology, Germany"],"firstName":"J\u00fcrgen","lastName":"Becker","id":"37270020100"},{"name":"Juanjo Noguera","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., Ireland"],"firstName":"Juanjo","lastName":"Noguera","id":"37265188800"},{"name":"Rodney Stewart","affiliation":["Xilinx Inc., Ireland"],"firstName":"Rodney","lastName":"Stewart","id":"37535777000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7320-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7321-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4076-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"5572769","dbTime":"9 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":339},"abstract":"Due to their their high flexibility and their increasing logic resources, FPGAs can be found in a wider application range as in recent years. But especially in application domains, where only a very restricted power budget is available, FPGAs still have to compete with other solutions. To reduce the power consumption to a minimum, many devices use different kinds of power saving modes, called sleep modes. In those modes they sacrifice functionality for the benefit of a lower consumption. Taking this idea to the extreme, many devices are only powered when it is necessary. If not, they are released from their power supply and do not drain current at all. The realization of such a sleep mode for a SRAM-based FPGA leads to difficulties. This is caused due to the fact, that the volatile memory is used to save the configuration of the device. The configuration has to be reloaded into the device every time when reattaching the power to the FPGA. This circumstance leads to restrictions for the device deployment in some electronic systems since in many cases the time a device may use to wake up is strictly limited. In several use cases, the configuration time of a SRAM based FPGA exceeds this limitation. This paper describes to decrease the configuration time of a design by exploiting the method of dynamic and partial reconfiguration in order to enable the usage of a sleep mode.

On the digital side, design automation and optimization tools have been around for a long time and are well established. These tools free up the designer to focus on more innovative tasks and allow for greater design productivity. The analog side, however, has yet to reach this point. There is much ongoing research in this area and many different approaches to try to mitigate the complexity of designing analog circuits. We propose an algorithm that utilizes the fast and efficient execution of linear programming to provide a solution for single objective optimization of small circuits. We show the results of this algorithm on three sample circuits with the objectives of maximizing gain and bandwidth. The results from our proposed optimization algorithm were within 10 percent of the maximum gain/bandwidth derived using traditional manual optimization methods.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.94","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570021/5571793/05572781.pdf","startPage":"253","endPage":"258","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.94","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fast Evaluation of Analog Circuits Using Linear Programming","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572781","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572781/","displayDocTitle":"Fast Evaluation of Analog Circuits Using Linear Programming","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11529394","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5572781/","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fast Evaluation of Analog Circuits Using Linear Programming","confLoc":"Lixouri, Greece","sourcePdf":"4076a253.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.080871S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570021","isNumber":"5571793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570021","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5571793","articleId":"5572781","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5572788,"authors":[{"name":"Srinidhi Kestur","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, USA"],"firstName":"Srinidhi","lastName":"Kestur","id":"37545433500"},{"name":"John D.

Optical NoCs are based on CMOS-compatible optical waveguides and micro resonators, and promise significant bandwidth and power advantages. In this paper, we propose a hybrid optical mesh NoC, HOME, which utilizes optical waveguides as well as metallic interconnects in a hierarchical manner. HOME employs a new set of protocols to improve the network throughput and latency. We compared HOME with a matched optical mesh NoC for a 64-core MPSoC in 45nm, using SPICE simulations and our cycle-accurate multi-objective NoC simulation platform, MoLab. Comparing with the optical mesh NoC, HOME uses 75% less optical/electronic interfaces and laser diodes. Simulation results show that HOME achieves 17% higher throughput and 40% less latency while consuming 42% less power.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Hierarchical Hybrid Optical-Electronic Network-on-Chip","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.17","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570021/5571793/05572795.pdf","startPage":"327","endPage":"332","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571793","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572795","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572795/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Hierarchical Hybrid Optical-Electronic Network-on-Chip","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5572795/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11529408","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Hierarchical Hybrid Optical-Electronic Network-on-Chip","confLoc":"Lixouri, Greece","sourcePdf":"4076a327.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.087492S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570021","isNumber":"5571793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570021","citationCount":"45","xplore-issue":"5571793","articleId":"5572795","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5572797,"authors":[{"name":"Elena Kakoulli","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Cyprus University of Technology, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Kakoulli","id":"37545666500"},{"name":"Vassos Soteriou","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, Cyprus University of Technology, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Vassos","lastName":"Soteriou","id":"37274796300"},{"name":"Theocharis Theocharides","affiliation":["KIOS Research Centre, Department of ECE, University of Cyprus, Cyprus"],"firstName":"Theocharis","lastName":"Theocharides","id":"37274607000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7320-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7321-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4076-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"5572797","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":362},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Neurons","Training","Monitoring","System-on-a-chip","Accuracy","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["network-on-chip","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["artificial neural network","hotspot prediction","network on-chip routers","systems on-chip","wormhole flow-control","hotspot prevention","interconnection system","hotspot avoidance","hotspot formation","buffer utilization statistical data","interconnect fabric"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NoC Hotspots","Neural Networks","Forecasting Mechanisms"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572797","abstract":"Hotspots are network on-chip (NoC) routers or modules in systems on-chip (SoCs) which occasionally receive packetized traffic at a rate higher than they can consume it. This adverse phenomenon greatly reduces the performance of an NoC, especially in the case of today's widely-employed wormhole flow-control, as backpressure can cause the buffers of neighboring routers to quickly fill-up leading to a spatial spread in congestion that can cause the network to saturate. Even worse, such situations may lead to deadlocks. Thus, a hotspot prevention mechanism can be greatly beneficial, as it can potentially enable the interconnection system to adjust its behavior and prevent the rise of potential hotspots, subsequently sustaining NoC performance and efficiency. Unfortunately, hotspots cannot be known a-priori in NoCs used in general-purpose systems as application demands are not predetermined unlike in application-specific SoCs, making hotspot prediction and subsequently prevention difficult. In this paper we present an artificial neural network-based hotspot prediction mechanism that can be potentially used in tandem with a hotspot avoidance mechanism for handling an unforeseen hotspot formation efficiently. The network uses buffer utilization statistical data to dynamically monitor the interconnect fabric, and reactively predicts the location of an about to-be-formed hotspot, allowing enough time for the system to react to these potential hotspots. The neural network is trained using synthetic traffic models, and evaluated using both synthetic and real application traces. Results indicate that a relatively small neural network can predict hotspot formation with accuracy ranges between 76% to 92% when evaluated on two different mesh NoCs.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.50","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570021/5571793/05572797.pdf","startPage":"339","endPage":"344","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Artificial Neural Network-Based Hotspot Prediction Mechanism for NoCs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572797/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"An Artificial Neural Network-Based Hotspot Prediction Mechanism for NoCs","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11529409","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5572797/","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Artificial Neural Network-Based Hotspot Prediction Mechanism for NoCs","confLoc":"Lixouri, Greece","sourcePdf":"4076a339.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.055821S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570021","isNumber":"5571793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570021","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5571793","articleId":"5572797","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5572814,"authors":[{"name":"Taniya Siddiqua","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Taniya","lastName":"Siddiqua","id":"37545377400"},{"name":"Sudhanva Gurumurthi","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Virginia, USA"],"firstName":"Sudhanva","lastName":"Gurumurthi","id":"37282414100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7320-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7321-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4076-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"5572814","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":31,"citationCountPatent":1,"totalDownloads":394},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572814","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Random access memory","Boosting","MOS devices","Microprocessors","Computer architecture","Transistors","Chromium"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["integrated circuit design","integrated circuit reliability","microprocessor chips","MOSFET","SRAM chips"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["recovery boosting","NBTI recovery techniques","SRAM arrays","negative bias temperature instability","lifetime reliability problem","microprocessors","PMOS devices","memory cell","circuit-level design","SPICE-level simulations","architecture-level evaluation","area-neutral design","M5 simulator","SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite","static noise margin","power consumption"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.15","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570021/5571793/05572814.pdf","startPage":"393","endPage":"398","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.15","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Recovery Boosting: A Technique to Enhance NBTI Recovery in SRAM Arrays","abstract":"Negative Bias Temperature Instability (NBTI) is an important lifetime reliability problem in microprocessors. SRAM-based structures within the processor are especially susceptible to NBTI since one of the PMOS devices in the memory cell always has an input of `0'. Previously proposed recovery techniques for SRAM cells aim to balance the degradation of the two PMOS devices by attempting to keep their inputs at a logic `0' exactly 50% of the time. However, one of the devices is always in the negative bias condition at any given time. In this paper, we propose a technique called Recovery Boosting that allows both PMOS devices in the memory cell to be put into the recovery mode by slightly modifying the design of conventional SRAM cells. We present the circuit-level design of an issue queue that uses such cells and perform SPICE-level simulations to verify its functionality and quantify area and power consumption. We then conduct an architecture-level evaluation of the performance and reliability of using an area-neutral design of such an issue queue using the M5 simulator and the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite. We show that recovery boosting provides a 56% improvement in the static noise margin for the issue queue while having very little impact on power consumption and a negligible loss in performance.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572814/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5572814/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11529420","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Recovery Boosting: A Technique to Enhance NBTI Recovery in SRAM Arrays","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Recovery Boosting: A Technique to Enhance NBTI Recovery in SRAM Arrays","confLoc":"Lixouri, Greece","sourcePdf":"4076a393.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.097245S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570021","isNumber":"5571793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570021","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5571793","articleId":"5572814","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5572816,"authors":[{"name":"Nicholas Axelos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Nicholas","lastName":"Axelos","id":"37528209800"},{"name":"Kiamal Pekmestzi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Kiamal","lastName":"Pekmestzi","id":"37283956600"},{"name":"Nikolaos Moschopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National and Technical University of Athens, Greece"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Moschopoulos","id":"37545665600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7320-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7321-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4076-4","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-3469"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-3477"}],"articleNumber":"5572816","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":473},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572816","keywords":[{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["CMOS integrated circuits","low-power electronics","SRAM chips","transistor circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["low-power soft-error tolerant SRAM cell","loadless SRAM cell","soft error resilience characteristics","interlocked structure","guard gates","static power consumption","CMOS technology","leakage current","DICE cell","similarly sized transistors"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Radiation Hardened Memory","Soft Error Resilience","Low Power","SRAM cell"]}],"doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.83","endPage":"404","startPage":"399","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570021/5571793/05572816.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.83","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A New Low-Power Soft-Error Tolerant SRAM Cell","abstract":"In this paper we present a new 12T loadless SRAM cell that exhibits soft error resilience characteristics.

Additionally to the computing intensive data processing, the power consumption for such systems needs to be minimized in order to keep them lightweight and mobile operational. One solution for achieving these goals is to exploit hardware parallelism for acceleration purposes on reconfigurable hardware, like Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). Due to the increase of performance, the clock speed can be reduced, which leads to a reduced power consumption in comparison to traditional processor-based approaches. A challenging task until today is the programming of these devices e.g. with standardized tools or languages like e.g. C. There exist C-to-FPGA tools that ease the programming of these systems, but they do not handle the communication with the environment, e.g. camera interfaces, PCI-interfaces, etc. This still has to be designed in time consuming and handcrafted work. Also the aforementioned tools still have some restriction on the input language. The novel approach in the presented work is to combine processors in a multiprocessor architecture on FPGA for high performance computing applications. This solution combines the flexibility of FPGAs and the high-level programming paradigms of multiprocessor systems and can be seen as a meet-in-the middle solution. This holistic approach is called RAMPSoC (Runtime Adaptive MPSoC) and combines a novel hardware architecture, consisting of heterogeneous processing elements connected over a novel heterogeneous Network-on-Chip, with a user-guided design methodology and a new runtime resource management system.","doi":"10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.30","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570021/5571793/05572823.pdf","startPage":"477","endPage":"478","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ISVLSI.2010.30","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571793","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-Based Runtime Adaptive Multiprocessor Approach for Embedded High Performance Computing Applications","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5572823","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-7 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572823/","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-Based Runtime Adaptive Multiprocessor Approach for Embedded High Performance Computing Applications","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11529429","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5572823/","conferenceDate":"5-7 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-Based Runtime Adaptive Multiprocessor Approach for Embedded High Performance Computing Applications","confLoc":"Lixouri, Greece","sourcePdf":"4076a477.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056363S","chronDate":"5-7 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570021","isNumber":"5571793","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570021","citationCount":"5","xplore-issue":"5571793","articleId":"5572823","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5572831,"authors":[{"name":"Cristina Silvano","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Cristina","lastName":"Silvano","id":"37295776300"},{"name":"William Fornaciari","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"William","lastName":"Fornaciari","id":"37282132600"},{"name":"Gianluca Palermo","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Gianluca","lastName":"Palermo","id":"37391879400"},{"name":"Vittorio Zaccaria","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Vittorio","lastName":"Zaccaria","id":"37326028900"},{"name":"Fabrizio Castro","affiliation":["Dipartimento di Elettronica e Informazione, Politecnico di Milano, Milano, Italy"],"firstName":"Fabrizio","lastName":"Castro","id":"37546604800"},{"name":"Marcos Martinez","affiliation":["Design of Systems on Silicon (DS2), Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Marcos","lastName":"Martinez","id":"37403806000"},{"name":"Sara Bocchio","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Italy"],"firstName":"Sara","lastName":"Bocchio","id":"37298484700"},{"name":"Roberto Zafalon","affiliation":["STMicroelectronics, Italy"],"firstName":"Roberto","lastName":"Zafalon","id":"37326121100"},{"name":"Prabhat Avasare","affiliation":["IIMEC, Belgium","IMEC vzw, Belgium"],"firstName":"Prabhat","lastName":"Avasare","id":"37392024100"},{"name":"Geert Vanmeerbeeck","affiliation":["IIMEC, Belgium","IMEC vzw, Belgium"],"firstName":"Geert","lastName":"Vanmeerbeeck","id":"37392237700"},{"name":"Chantal Ykman-Couvreur","affiliation":["IIMEC, Belgium","IMEC vzw, Belgium"],"firstName":"Chantal","lastName":"Ykman-Couvreur","id":"38277322000"},{"name":"Maryse Wouters","affiliation":["IIMEC, Belgium","IMEC vzw, Belgium"],"firstName":"Maryse","lastName":"Wouters","id":"37277564300"},{"name":"Carlos Kavka","affiliation":["ESTECO s. r. l., Italy","ESTECO, Italy"],"firstName":"Carlos","lastName":"Kavka","id":"38181124600"},{"name":"Luka Onesti","affiliation":["ESTECO s. r. l., Italy","ESTECO, Italy"],"firstName":"Luka","lastName":"Onesti","id":"38272254200"},{"name":"Alessandro Turco","affiliation":["ESTECO s. r. l., Italy","ESTECO, Italy"],"firstName":"Alessandro","lastName":"Turco","id":"37408638100"},{"name":"Umberto Bondi","affiliation":["Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China"],"firstName":"Umberto","lastName":"Bondi","id":"37396927800"},{"name":"Giovanni Mariani","affiliation":["ALaRI -

performances and the energy consumptions of storage systems. In order to attain significant performance and energy gains from NVC, it would be better to use multi-level-cell (MLC) flash memories since they can provide a large NVC capacity at low cost. However, the number of available program/erase cycles of MLC flash memory is smaller than that of single-level-cell (SLC) flash memory, which limits the lifespan of an NVC. In order to overcome this limitation, SLC/MLC combined flash memory is a promising solution for use in NVC. This paper proposes an effective management scheme for heterogeneous SLC and MLC regions of combined flash memory. It also proposes a design technique which is able to determine the optimal proportion between the two regions that maximizes performance and energy reduction, guaranteeing the lifespan constraint. We show experimentally how performance, lifespan, and energy consumption of the NVC-embedded hard disk change depending upon the configuration of the combined flash memory. We also show the superiority of the proposed NVC management policy in comparison to alternative policies.","doi":"10.1109/SNAPI.2010.11","publicationTitle":"2010 International Workshop on Storage Network Architecture and Parallel I/Os","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Workshop on Storage Network Architecture and Parallel I/Os","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570124/5571750/05572846.pdf","startPage":"21","endPage":"30","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SNAPI.2010.11","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571750","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"NAND Flash-Based Disk Cache Using SLC/MLC Combined Flash Memory","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"NAND Flash-Based Disk Cache Using SLC/MLC Combined Flash Memory","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11529338","publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5572846/","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5572846/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"3-3 May 2010","conferenceDate":"3-3 May 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"NAND Flash-Based Disk Cache Using SLC/MLC Combined Flash Memory","confLoc":"Incline Village, NV, USA","sourcePdf":"4025a021.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.213523S","chronDate":"3-3 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570124","isNumber":"5571750","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570124","citationCount":"17","xplore-issue":"5571750","articleId":"5572846","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5572858,"authors":[{"name":"Weicheng Xie","affiliation":["School of Electrical and information Engineering, XIHUA University, Chengdu, P.R.

Radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) are used to approximate the function uncertainties of MIMO nonlinear systems. An auxiliary design system is introduced to analyze the constraint effect of the input saturation and its states are used to design tracking control scheme. In the proposed tracking control, the nonsingular assumption of neural network (NN) approximation of completely unknown control coefficient matrix and boundary restriction between NN approximation error and control input are eliminated for uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems.

Then, the uncertain parameters of Gauss membership functions of interval type-2 fuzzy sets are decided.

Because an image can contain the much traffic information and intuitively display the network status, it is helpful to reduce the processing time for detecting the anomalies. Therefore we proposed a hierarchical approach to detecting various network attacks using a two-tiered system of image analysis. In a first tier, random attacks are detected by analyzing the global traffic and we will be able to discover semi-random attacks by examining the local traffic images in second tier.

Those associative applications and services based on cloud computing are dramatically emerging. However, in order to enjoy the widely utilization of cloud computing through wired/wireless networking, providing sufficient assurance of information security such as confidentiality, authentication, non-repudiation, and integrity is the critical factor of success promotion. In this paper, a dynamic intrusion detection system for strengthening the security application of cloud computing is proposed. In the proposed mechanism, numbers of intrusion detectors are dispatched on the whole topology of the networking system through multi-layers and multi-stages deployment. Those information security issues related with the application and service of cloud computing will be experimented and discussed. The experiments include the equipment security of the client side termination, the threats of web site and webpage, the detection and diagnosis and surveillance of intrusion, the access and security of database in the cloud side, the detection of system leakage and the monitor of real-time repairing process, the management of server system, the management of mobile e-commerce processing, and the integrated analysis of associated security information and issues. The goal of the proposed mechanism is not only focused on find out some solutions, but also focused on develop some feasible information security techniques or products for the application and service of cloud computing.

Based on the input output polynomial model which can be easily transformed into the row canonical state space model, Tapped delay line are introduced, so the MADALINE becomes recurrent in nature and thus is suitable for parameter estimation of such systems. The MADALINE can then be setup under the assumption that the system structure is known in advance. The estimated parameters are obtained as the weights of trained individual neurons of the MADALINE. The method is implemented in MATLAB and simulation study was then performed on a few well known examples. Simulation results show that the algorithms offer satisfactory performance.

To compensate the hysteresis nonlinearity and improve the precision of system with hysteresis, the modeling of hysteresis and the corresponding inverse compensation is studied in this paper. First, the dynamic Preisach model for hysteresis is built. Based on the original commom dynamic Preisach model, the information of historical input voltage is introduced into the Preisach function. Then a neural network is used for identification of the model. Secondly, a dynamic inverse Preisach model of hysteresis is built by introducing information of historical displacement to Preisach function and is identified using a neural network. Finally, the dynamic inverse Preisach model based on neural networks is used to compensate the hysteresis nonlinearity. The model is shown through experiments to offer high accuracy under voltage excitations with different frequency. Through the experimental results, the maximum of the absolute error predicted by the new model and inverse model is reduced to 0.1\u03bcm and 1V. The nonlinear characteristic is reduced effectively by the inverse compensation with neural networks, with the error below 0.7\u03bcm.","startPage":"446","endPage":"451","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 29th Chinese Control Conference","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5571954","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the 29th Chinese Control Conference","pdfPath":"/iel5/5562463/5571954/05573412.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamic Preisach model and inverse compensation for hysteresis of piezoceramic actuator based on neural networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5573412/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Dynamic Preisach model and inverse compensation for hysteresis of piezoceramic actuator based on neural networks","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5573412/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11611960","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic Preisach model and inverse compensation for hysteresis of piezoceramic actuator based on neural networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"00871141.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.081477S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5562463","isNumber":"5571954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562463","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5571954","articleId":"5573412","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"Chinese Association of Aut","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5573420,"authors":[{"name":"Dingxue Zhang","affiliation":["Petroleum Engineering College, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China"],"firstName":"Dingxue","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37087748943"},{"name":"Yinghui Zhu","affiliation":["Petroleum Engineering College, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China"],"firstName":"Yinghui","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37088207443"},{"name":"Ruiquan Liao","affiliation":["Petroleum Engineering College, Yangtze University, Jingzhou 434023, China"],"firstName":"Ruiquan","lastName":"Liao","id":"37531660700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-7-8946-3104-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6263-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-7-8946-3104-6","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1934-1768"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2161-2927"}],"articleNumber":"5573420","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Particle swarm optimization","Heuristic algorithms","Electronic mail","Convergence","Conferences","Petroleum"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimisation","probability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["particle swarm optimization","dynamically changing inertia weight","multimodal function","probability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Particle Swarm Optimization","Inertia Weight","Population Diversity"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5573420","abstract":"To overcome the premature caused by standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm searching for the large lost in population diversity for the little search space, a dynamically changing inertia weight PSO based on the average distance with the best previously visited position and the position of the best individual of the whole swarm is proposed.

In this method, a dynamic hysteretic operator is introduced to extract the memory property and rate-dependent property of hysteresis. The non-smooth property is also described in the operator. Moreover, the multi-valued mapping of hysteresis is decomposed into a one-to-one mapping which enables neural networks to approximate the behavior of hysteresis. Thus, the dynamic hysteresis model based on neural networks is derived. The proposed neural model is simple in structure and available for rate-dependent hysteresis. The weights of neural networks can be adjusted to adapt for different conditions. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to model the hysteresis in piezoelectric actuators.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"29-31 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5573442/","accessionNumber":"11612183","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29-31 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Dynamic model of hysteresis for piezoelectric actuators based on hysteretic operator and neural networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamic model of hysteresis for piezoelectric actuators based on hysteretic operator and neural networks","confLoc":"Beijing, China","sourcePdf":"02581445.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.039192S","chronDate":"29-31 July 2010","isNumber":"5571954","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5562463","articleId":"5573442","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","lastupdate":"2021-12-10"},{"_id":5573462,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Roggen","affiliation":["Wearable Computing Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switerland"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Roggen","id":"37277847700"},{"name":"Alberto Calatroni","affiliation":["Wearable Computing Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switerland"],"firstName":"Alberto","lastName":"Calatroni","id":"37542027500"},{"name":"Mirco Rossi","affiliation":["Wearable Computing Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switerland"],"firstName":"Mirco","lastName":"Rossi","id":"37397130000"},{"name":"Thomas Holleczek","affiliation":["Wearable Computing Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switerland"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Holleczek","id":"37541396300"},{"name":"Kilian F\u00f6rster","affiliation":["Wearable Computing Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switerland"],"firstName":"Kilian","lastName":"F\u00f6rster","id":"37402726500"},{"name":"Gerhard Tr\u00f6ster","affiliation":["Wearable Computing Laboratory, ETH Z\u00fcrich, Switerland"],"firstName":"Gerhard","lastName":"Tr\u00f6ster","id":"37275939700"},{"name":"Paul Lukowicz","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory, University of Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Paul","lastName":"Lukowicz","id":"37275933300"},{"name":"David Bannach","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory, University of Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"David","lastName":"Bannach","id":"37297020700"},{"name":"Gerald Pirkl","affiliation":["Embedded Systems Laboratory, University of Passau, Germany"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Pirkl","id":"37393049000"},{"name":"Alois Ferscha","affiliation":["Institute for Pervasive Computing, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Alois","lastName":"Ferscha","id":"37269560600"},{"name":"Jakob Doppler","affiliation":["Institute for Pervasive Computing, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Jakob","lastName":"Doppler","id":"37542025300"},{"name":"Clemens Holzmann","affiliation":["Institute for Pervasive Computing, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Clemens","lastName":"Holzmann","id":"37530266100"},{"name":"Marc Kurz","affiliation":["Institute for Pervasive Computing, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Marc","lastName":"Kurz","id":"37534228400"},{"name":"Gerald Holl","affiliation":["Institute for Pervasive Computing, Johannes Kepler University Linz, Linz, Austria"],"firstName":"Gerald","lastName":"Holl","id":"37542024400"},{"name":"Ricardo Chavarriaga","affiliation":["Defitech Foundation Chair in Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Chavarriaga","id":"37542031500"},{"name":"Hesam Sagha","affiliation":["Defitech Foundation Chair in Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface, Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland"],"firstName":"Hesam","lastName":"Sagha","id":"37529521800"},{"name":"Hamidreza Bayati","affiliation":["Ecole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, Switzerland","Department of Informatics Systems and Telematics, University of Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Hamidreza","lastName":"Bayati","id":"37542031100"},{"name":"Marco Creatura","affiliation":["Department of Informatics Systems and Telematics, University of Genova, Italy"],"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Creatura","id":"37542030900"},{"name":"Jos\u00e9 del R.

We report the number of activity occurrences observed during post-processing, and estimate that over 13000 and 14000 object and environment interactions occurred. We describe the networked sensor setup and the methodology for data acquisition, synchronization and curation. We report on the challenges and outline lessons learned and best practice for similar large scale deployments of heterogeneous networked sensor systems. We evaluate data acquisition quality for on-body and object integrated wireless sensors; there is less than 2.5% packet loss after tuning. We outline our use of the dataset to develop new sensor network self-organization principles and machine learning techniques for activity recognition in opportunistic sensor configurations.

Firstly, the unknown maneuver of the target is decomposed into non-stochastic and stochastic parts. Secondly, by assuming the intensity and duration of the unknown non-stochastic part are finite, the transfer function from the unknown maneuvering of the target to the estimation system bias is deduced by classical control theory. Then, the relationship between dynamic bias coefficient and filter gain matrix is analyzed. Thirdly, the satisfactory bias-allowable filter is proposed by particle swarm optimization(PSO) method for the given order system, which can guarantee the dynamic bias coefficient as lower as possible under the constraints of regional pole index and error variance upper bound index. Differing from H\u221e filter, the proposed filter considers the dynamic index of the estimation error, which makes it possible of using lower system model to track maneuvering object and can let the estimation output satisfy the satisfactory system error and stochastic error index requirements.

In this paper, based on the characteristics of nonsubsampled contourlet coefficients of images and the correlativity indexes, a novel image quality assessment is proposed. Firstly, the reference image and the distorted images are decomposed into several levels by means of nonsubsampled contourlet transform respectively. The nonsubsampled contourlet coefficients of the reference image (the distorted images) are as the reference sequences (the comparative sequences). Secondly, calculate the correlativity indexes between the reference sequences and the comparative sequences respectively. Moreover, image quality assessment vector of every distorted image can be constructed based on the correlativity indexes and image quality can be assessed.

It is observed that the measured delays, including all types of data processing, encapsulation, decapsulation and propagation, meet real-time control network requirements while guaranteeing correct packet reception.

Only a few algorithms exist to take the recovery of the tampered areas into account. This motivates us to develop a novel authentication scheme for the accurate tamper localization and restoration of the tampered areas. In particular, the host image will firstly be divided into blocks, the recovery watermark of each block is embedded into another distant block selected by a key, and the localization watermark of each block is embedded into itself. During generating the localization watermarks, the sliding window is used to put resistance against VQ attack. It is the dual watermarks that can distinguish tampering watermark from that of image. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the watermarked image has higher quality, and what's more the position of tampered areas can be located correctly. Additionally, it can restore the tampered region effectively.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Watermarking","Authentication","Pixel","PSNR","Conferences","Image restoration","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image coding","image restoration","vector quantisation","watermarking"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["restorative image authentication scheme","tampers discrimination","image watermarking","image authentication schemes","vector quantization counterfeiting attacks","tamper localization","tampered areas restoration"]}],"doi":"10.1109/MUE.2010.5575077","publicationTitle":"2010 4th International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 4th International Conference on Multimedia and Ubiquitous Engineering","pdfPath":"/iel5/5557894/5575048/05575077.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575048","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MUE.2010.5575077","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Restorative Image Authentication Scheme with Discrimination of Tampers on Image or Watermark","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575077","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"A Restorative Image Authentication Scheme with Discrimination of Tampers on Image or Watermark","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575077/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575077/","accessionNumber":"11579706","conferenceDate":"11-13 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-13 Aug. 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Restorative Image Authentication Scheme with Discrimination of Tampers on Image or Watermark","confLoc":"Cebu, Philippines","sourcePdf":"05-05.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045269S","chronDate":"11-13 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5557894","isNumber":"5575048","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5557894","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5575048","articleId":"5575077","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-11"},{"_id":5575106,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Zhu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical& Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37715845200"},{"name":"Hong-Chuan Yang","affiliation":["Department of Electrical& Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Hong-Chuan","lastName":"Yang","id":"37278138800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5376-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5377-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"},{"format":"CD","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5575106","dbTime":"7 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":119},"abstract":"In this paper, we present a new multiuser beamforming transmission scheme for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

This changing speed is called maneuvering. The proposed blind system has a hard decision switching block which selects between different speed modes of a maneuvering terminal. The speed can be therefore tracked in a mobile data communication link. This is accomplished based on only the received data information signal, i.e., no other information (for example from a speed sensor or radar, etc.) is required. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated by simulation and comparison is made with optimal coherent detection. The importance of introducing the switching block can be demonstrated by disabling it in the algorithm, and this results in a large degradation in performance. To assess the direct impact of the proposed blind channel estimation on the error performance, a fair comparison with a known, blind technique based on Kalman filtering is also made, with the assumption of non-maneuvering terminals. Here, improved performance is observed.","publicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564896/5575102/05575131.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575131","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575131","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575102","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Blind channel estimation for MRC systems with maneuvering transmit/receive terminals","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575131/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Blind channel estimation for MRC systems with maneuvering transmit/receive terminals","htmlLink":"/document/5575131/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11534593","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Blind channel estimation for MRC systems with maneuvering transmit/receive terminals","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569277550.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075639S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564896","isNumber":"5575102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564896","xplore-issue":"5575102","articleId":"5575131","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5575136,"authors":[{"name":"Alireza Mirzaee","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Alireza","lastName":"Mirzaee","id":"37282383900"},{"name":"Claude D'Amours","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Canada"],"firstName":"Claude","lastName":"D'Amours","id":"38228644300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5376-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5377-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"},{"format":"CD","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5575136","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":64},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Transmitting antennas","Bit error rate","Receiving antennas","Convolutional codes","Convolution","Multiaccess communication","Detectors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["code division multiple access","convolutional codes","error statistics","MIMO systems","spread spectrum communication","transmitting antennas","Viterbi decoding","waveform analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["soft output detector","MIMO-CDMA systems","parity bit selected","permutation spreading","data-dependent spreading waveforms","transmit antennas","transmitting data","LLR","outer convolutional encoder","soft input Viterbi decoder","BER performance"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["MIMO","CDMA","Soft output detection"]}],"abstract":"In this paper a soft output detector for a MIMO-CDMA system with data-dependent spreading waveforms is proposed.

Based on the asymptotic analysis, it is first demonstrated that in the first time slot, the source only needs to send the superposition of the first symbol and the rotated version of the second symbol, while being silent in the remaining slot to achieve the best asymptotic performance. It is then shown that a rotation angle that maximizes the minimum Euclidean distance of the superposition constellation should be used for good convergence behavior. An optimal rotation angle is then analytically determined for various modulation schemes.

We evaluate the upper bound for the global maximum of the system utility, whose actual value is very difficult to obtain when the utility functions are not concave. A linear programming based resource allocation algorithm is proposed to approach the bound, and a priority-based resource allocation algorithm is developed for practical OFDMA systems. The proposed practical algorithm achieves high system utility by allocating resources first to the users who can contribute higher system utility with fewer subchannel resources. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the upper bound and excellent performance of the proposed algorithms.","displayPublicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564896/5575102/05575230.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","publicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575230","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575230","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575102","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575230","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation for real-time services in OFDMA systems","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Resource management","Upper bound","OFDM","Signal to noise ratio","Optimization","Interference","Downlink"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cellular radio","frequency division multiple access","linear programming","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["adaptive resource allocation","real-time service","OFDMA cellular system","linear programming","priority-based resource allocation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["OFDMA","Adaptive Resource Allocation"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575230/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Adaptive resource allocation for real-time services in OFDMA systems","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575230/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11534658","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Adaptive resource allocation for real-time services in OFDMA systems","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569271469.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053755S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564896","isNumber":"5575102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564896","xplore-issue":"5575102","articleId":"5575230","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5575233,"authors":[{"name":"Najmeh Khosroshahi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada"],"firstName":"Najmeh","lastName":"Khosroshahi","id":"38556269600"},{"name":"T.

The FTS is a fast block-matching algorithm for motion estimation proposed in previous work. The FTS is used for block-based motion estimation where it can locate the best matching blocks between two frames using a search triangle of flexible size and orientation. This flexibility provide the triangle with the high efficiency to locate the best matching block in fewer number of search iterations. Further analyses of the FTS performance indicates that more computation efficiency can be achieved in loading the search area and the computing the matching criterion between two macroblocks. Adjacent search areas are overlapped and consequently, the loading mechanism can be modified to load only the non-overlapped sections In addition, loading of search area and other data can start earlier parallel with the algorithm initialization. Finally, the computed SAD results can be stored and then later used instead of re-computing them again. The proposed implementation in this paper reduces the average number of cycles required to finish one macroblock search by around 26% and thus enable the video encoder to support higher frequencies or larger resolutions. The proposed technique was implemented in FPGA as part of the flexible triangle search (FTS) motion estimation algorithm. The proposed design was implemented, simulated, and tested using VHDL and synthesized using Xilinx ISE for the Xilinx Spartan3 device. The results obtained were compared to an FPGA implementation of the FTS algorithm published in previous work.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Computation-efficient FPGA implementation for flexible triangle search block-based motion estimation algorithm","publicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575242","displayPublicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564896/5575102/05575242.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"4","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575242","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575102","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575242","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575242/","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2010","displayDocTitle":"Computation-efficient FPGA implementation for flexible triangle search block-based motion estimation algorithm","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575242/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"May 2010","accessionNumber":"11534544","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Computation-efficient FPGA implementation for flexible triangle search block-based motion estimation algorithm","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569271011.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.150447S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564896","isNumber":"5575102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564896","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5575102","articleId":"5575242","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5575249,"authors":[{"name":"R.

However, there exist numerous structural measures that capture different aspects of size, coupling and complexity. Identifying a metric subset that enhances the performance for the predictive objective would not only improve the model but also provide insights into the structural properties that lead to problematic modules. Another difficulty in building predictive models comes from unbalanced datasets, which are common in empirical software engineering as a majority of the modules are not likely to be faulty. Oversampling attempts to overcome this deficiency by generating new training instances from the faulty modules. We present the results of applying search-based metric selection and oversampling to three NASA datasets. For these datasets, oversampling results in the largest improvement. Metric subset selection was able to reduce up to 52% of the metrics without decreasing the predictive performance gained with oversampling.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Measurement","Predictive models","Training","Search problems","Accuracy","Software","Classification algorithms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithms","program diagnostics","sampling methods","search problems","software metrics","software quality"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["search based metric selection","oversampling","fault prone modules prediction","source code metrics","predictive models","software engineering","NASA datasets"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Software Quality Models","Source Code Metrics","Genetic Algorithm","Dataset Oversampling"]}],"doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575249","publicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","displayPublicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564896/5575102/05575249.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"6","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575102","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575249","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using search-based metric selection and oversampling to predict fault prone modules","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575249","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Using search-based metric selection and oversampling to predict fault prone modules","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575249/","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"May 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575249/","accessionNumber":"11534551","conferenceDate":"2-5 May 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"2-5 May 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using search-based metric selection and oversampling to predict fault prone modules","confLoc":"Calgary, AB, Canada","sourcePdf":"1569269241.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049728S","chronDate":"2-5 May 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564896","isNumber":"5575102","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564896","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5575102","articleId":"5575249","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5575253,"authors":[{"name":"Christopher Kennedy","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Western Ontario, London, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Christopher","lastName":"Kennedy","id":"37941675700"},{"name":"Jonathan Manii","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jonathan","lastName":"Manii","id":"38193511800"},{"name":"Jeremy Gribben","affiliation":["School of Information Technology and Engineering, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ONT, Canada"],"firstName":"Jeremy","lastName":"Gribben","id":"37541995400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5376-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5377-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0840-7789"},{"format":"CD","value":"0840-7789"}],"articleNumber":"5575253","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":268},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Polynomials","Computer architecture","Delay","Generators","Hardware","Logic gates","Software"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cyclic redundancy check codes","error detection codes","field programmable gate arrays"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["retimed two-step CRC computation","FPGA","cyclic redundancy check","multiple polynomial","fixed generator polynomial","delay","software algorithm","field-programmable gate array","Xilinx Virtex-5","error control coding"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["computer arithmetic","cyclic redundancy check (CRC)","error control coding (ECC)","Xilinx"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575253","displayPublicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564896/5575102/05575253.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"7","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575253","doi":"10.1109/CCECE.2010.5575253","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575102","publicationTitle":"CCECE 2010","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Retimed two-step CRC computation on FPGA","abstract":"Previously, a two-step approach to perform the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) computation in hardware was presented.

Our approach uses an offline trained multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a classifier, which is subsequently used to identify the landform classes in a satellite image.

Gray level co-occurrence texture statistics, which form the feature vector representing the pattern, are used for training the MLP.

In order to improve the user comfort and enable the use of these types of systems on active mobile subjects, we propose a wireless body sensor system that incorporates multiple sensors on a single node. This multisensor node includes signal acquisition, processing, and wireless data transmission fitted on multiple layers of a thin flexible substrate with a very small footprint. Considerations for design include size, form factor, reliable body attachment, good signal coupling, low power consumption, and user convenience. The prototype device measures 55 15 mm and is 3 mm thick. The unit is attached to the patient's chest, and is capable of performing simultaneous measurements of parameters, such as body motion, activity intensity, tilt, respiration, cardiac vibration, cardiac potential (ECG), heart rate, and body surface temperature. In this paper, we discuss the architecture of this system, including the multisensor hardware, the firmware, a mobile-phone receiver unit, and assembly of the first proof-of-concept prototype. Preliminary performance results on key elements of the system, such as power consumption, wireless range, algorithm efficiency, ECG signal quality for heart-rate calculations, as well as synchronous ECG and body activity signals are also presented.","doi":"10.1109/TBCAS.2010.2052616","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/4156126/5586708/05575361.pdf","startPage":"281","endPage":"294","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TBCAS.2010.2052616","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5586708","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Mechanically Flexible Wireless Multisensor Platform for Human Physical Activity and Vitals Monitoring","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575361","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575361/","displayDocTitle":"Mechanically Flexible Wireless Multisensor Platform for Human Physical Activity and Vitals Monitoring","volume":"4","issue":"5","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11556697","pubMedId":"23853374","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575361/","dateOfInsertion":"27 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Mechanically Flexible Wireless Multisensor Platform for Human Physical Activity and Vitals Monitoring","sourcePdf":"tbcas-ychuo-2052616-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.087132S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"4156126","isNumber":"5586708","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"4156126","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5586708","articleId":"5575361","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5575366,"authors":[{"name":"Jongwoo Lee","affiliation":["Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4156126/5586708/5575366/5575366-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Jongwoo Lee (S'03\u2013M'08) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, in 2001, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in 2004 and 2008, respectively.","Prior to beginning his graduate studies, he was an Operational Officer (1st LT) with the Ministry of Nation Defense in Korea for two-and-a-half years. from 2008 to 2010, he was an Analog Circuit Engineer with BitWave Semiconductor, Inc., Lowell, MA.

A two-stage complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) amplifier-filter has been implemented with 0.18-\u03bcm CMOS for simultaneous, multimodal recording of extracellular unit spikes and LFPs. For the frequency tuning and the reduction of the 1/f noise, it employs a switched-capacitor technique. The filter bandwidth is reconfigurable by using a different sampling clock frequency.

Jamming is difficult to mitigate in broadcast networks because transmitting and receiving are inherently symmetric operations: A user that possesses the key to decode a transmission can also use that key to jam the transmission. We describe a code tree system that provides input to the physical layer and helps the physical layer circumvent jammers. In our system, the transmitter has more information than any proper subset of receivers. Each receiver cooperates with the transmitter to detect any jamming that affects that receiver. In the resulting system, each benign user is guaranteed to eliminate the impact of the attacker after some finite number of losses with arbitrarily high probability. We show that any system that relies on only using spreading code, and no other physical factors, to mitigate jamming must use at least codes, where is the number of jammers. We then propose an optimized scheme that is power-efficient: Each transmission is sent on at most codes simultaneously. Finally, we demonstrate that our scheme approaches the best possible performance by performing an extensive analysis of the system using both event-driven ns-2 and chip-accurate MATLAB simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Cross-Layer Jamming Detection and Mitigation in Wireless Broadcast Networks","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2068576","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5714229/05575381.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2068576","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5714229","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575381","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575381/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Cross-Layer Jamming Detection and Mitigation in Wireless Broadcast Networks","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"19","issue":"1","dateOfInsertion":"17 February 2011","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","accessionNumber":"11832681","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Cross-Layer Jamming Detection and Mitigation in Wireless Broadcast Networks","sourcePdf":"tnet-chiang-2068576-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.064747S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","isNumber":"5714229","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"45","articleId":"5575381","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5575386,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Andrews","affiliation":["Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA"],"bio":{"p":["Matthew Andrews received the B.A. degree (first class honors) in mathematics from Oxford University, Oxford, U.K., in 1993, and the Ph.D. degree in theoretical computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1997.","He is a Distinguished Member of Technical Staff with the Mathematics of Networks and Systems Department, Bell Labs, Murray Hill, NJ.

Each scheduling decision involves assigning carriers to users for each time slot, subject to the constraint that each carrier is assigned to at most one user, but multiple carriers can potentially be assigned to the same user. One important aspect of our problem is that a scheduler knows the channel rates across all users and all carriers whenever a scheduling decision is made. This \u201cglobal\u201d information may give a potential for enhancing performance via an optimized allocation of carriers to users. We analyze this problem in a situation where finite queues are fed by a data arrival process. The well-known MaxWeight algorithm for the single-carrier setting maximizes the product of queue size and service rate. We focus on how to adapt MaxWeight to the multicarrier setting. If the same objective is pursued, more service than needed may be assigned to drain a queue, thereby creating wastage. While a simple variant in the objective forbids this wastage, it turns an easy-to-compute old objective into an intractable new objective. We state the hardness of the new optimization problems and propose several extremely simple algorithms with provable performance bounds. We conclude with supporting simulation examples.","doi":"10.1109/TNET.2010.2064175","publicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking","pdfPath":"/iel5/90/5750164/05575386.pdf","startPage":"447","endPage":"455","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TNET.2010.2064175","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5750164","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Scheduling Algorithms for Multicarrier Wireless Data Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575386","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"April  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575386/","displayDocTitle":"Scheduling Algorithms for Multicarrier Wireless Data Systems","volume":"19","issue":"2","publicationDate":"April 2011","accessionNumber":"11960316","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575386/","dateOfInsertion":"15 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Scheduling Algorithms for Multicarrier Wireless Data Systems","sourcePdf":"tnet-zhang-2064175-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.123474S","chronDate":"April  2011","xplore-pub-id":"90","isNumber":"5750164","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"90","citationCount":"14","xplore-issue":"5750164","articleId":"5575386","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5575387,"authors":[{"name":"Philippe C.

The nonthermal or cold soldering using electrically conductive paste enables direct soldering of the coaxial feed points or connector legs, which cannot otherwise be done with hot or thermal soldering. This type of connection greatly enhances the performance of the AgHT-8 polymer antennas compared to coaxial feed point connections through hot-soldered copper pads glued to the surface of the polymer coating. The proposed technique also gives a stronger connection bond than directly cold-soldering the feed points or connectors to the smooth surface of the AgHT-8 material. Furthermore, the copper pad connection technique also introduces additional losses contributed by the adhesive properties of the glue used. This proposed novel technique and soldering method may be extended to enhance antenna performance made from other similar transparent conductive polymers like ITO.","doi":"10.1109/LAWP.2010.2077271","publicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/7727/5423326/05575388.pdf","startPage":"918","endPage":"921","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LAWP.2010.2077271","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5423326","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Technique and Soldering Method to Improve Performance of Transparent Polymer Antennas","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575388","pubTopics":[{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575388/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Technique and Soldering Method to Improve Performance of Transparent Polymer Antennas","volume":"9","publicationDate":"2010","accessionNumber":"11559809","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575388/","dateOfInsertion":"30 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Technique and Soldering Method to Improve Performance of Transparent Polymer Antennas","sourcePdf":"lawp-peter-2077271-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.048904S","chronDate":"2010","xplore-pub-id":"7727","isNumber":"5423326","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7727","citationCount":"35","xplore-issue":"5423326","articleId":"5575388","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5575390,"authors":[{"name":"Rakesh Sambaraju","affiliation":["Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Valencia, Valencia, Spain"],"firstName":"Rakesh","lastName":"Sambaraju","id":"37320121600"},{"name":"Darko Zibar","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Darko","lastName":"Zibar","id":"37269751000"},{"name":"Antonio Caballero","affiliation":["DTU Fotonik, Technical University of Denmark, Kongens Lyngby, Denmark"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Caballero","id":"37318946900"},{"name":"Idelfonso T.

To correct for the phase and frequency offset originating from the heterodyne mixing of the two free-running lasers, wireless signal demodulation based on optical coherent detection in combination with baseband digital signal processing is implemented. As a proof of concept, 5-Gb/s amplitude-shift keying and up to a 16-Gb/s QPSK wireless signal in the band of 75-110 GHz was generated and successfully demodulated.

(TR) scheme to reduce the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal. In the TR scheme, PAPR reduction performance achieved by a randomly generated PRT set is superior to that by a consecutive PRT set and that achieved by an interleaved tone set. However, the optimal PRT set requires an exhaustive search of all combinations of possible PRT sets, which is known to be a nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard and cannot be solved for the practical number of tones. Inspired by the efficiency of the cross-entropy (CE) method for finding near-optimal solutions in huge search spaces, this letter proposes the application of the CE method to search the optimal PRT set. Computer simulation results show that the proposed CE method obtains near-optimal PRT sets and provides better PAPR performance.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Tone Reservation Using Near-Optimal Peak Reduction Tone Set Selection Algorithm for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","publicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","doi":"10.1109/LSP.2010.2077278","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","pdfPath":"/iel5/97/5559660/05575391.pdf","startPage":"933","endPage":"936","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/LSP.2010.2077278","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5559660","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575391","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575391/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Tone Reservation Using Near-Optimal Peak Reduction Tone Set Selection Algorithm for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"17","issue":"11","htmlLink":"/document/5575391/","dateOfInsertion":"23 September 2010","publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534374","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Tone Reservation Using Near-Optimal Peak Reduction Tone Set Selection Algorithm for PAPR Reduction in OFDM Systems","sourcePdf":"lsp-li-2077278-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.089776S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"97","isNumber":"5559660","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"97","citationCount":"53","xplore-issue":"5559660","articleId":"5575391","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Letter","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5575396,"authors":[{"name":"Zhaozhang Jin","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5762410/5575396/5575396-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Zhaozhang Jin (S'06) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China, and the M.S. degree in computer science and engineering from The Ohio State University, Columbus, where he is currently pursuing the Ph.D. degree.","His research interests include signal processing, machine learning, and computational auditory scene analysis."]},"firstName":"Zhaozhang","lastName":"Jin","id":"37633143100"},{"name":"DeLiang Wang","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Ohio State Uinversity, Columbus, OH, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/10376/5762410/5575396/5575396-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["DeLiang Wang (M'90\u2013SM'01\u2013F'04) received the B.S. and M.S. degrees from Peking (Beijing) University, Beijing, China, in 1983 and 1986, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, in 1991, all in computer science.","From July 1986 to December 1987, he was with the Institute of Computing Technology, Academia Sinica, Beijing.

Determining pitch in reverberant and noisy speech is a particularly challenging task. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm for multipitch tracking in the presence of both background noise and room reverberation. An auditory front-end and a new channel selection method are utilized to extract periodicity features. We derive pitch scores for each pitch state, which estimate the likelihoods of the observed periodicity features given pitch candidates. A hidden Markov model integrates these pitch scores and searches for the best pitch state sequence. Our algorithm can reliably detect single and double pitch contours in noisy and reverberant conditions.

However, F0 modeling is difficult because F0 values are normally considered to depend on a binary voicing decision such that they are continuous in voiced regions and undefined in unvoiced regions. F0 is therefore a discontinuous function of time. Multi-space probability distribution HMM (MSDHMM) is a widely used solution to this problem. The MSDHMM essentially uses a joint distribution of discrete voicing labels and the discontinuous F0 observations. However, due to the discontinuity assumption, the MSDHMM provides a rather weak F0 trajectory model. In this paper, F0 is viewed as being a continuous function of time and this is achieved by assuming that F0 can be observed within unvoiced regions as well as voiced regions. This provides a continuous F0 data stream which can be modeled by standard HMMs. Voicing labels are modeled either implicitly or explicitly in order to perform voicing classification and a globally tied distribution (GTD) technique is used to achieve robust F0 estimation.

This paper addresses this problem by using Bayesian inference to represent a priori relationships among ECG wave components. Based on the recently introduced partially collapsed Gibbs sampler principle, the wave delineation and estimation are conducted simultaneously by using a Bayesian algorithm combined with a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. This method exploits the strong local dependency of ECG signals. The proposed strategy is evaluated on the annotated QT database and compared to other classical algorithms. An important feature of this paper is that it allows not only for the detection of P- and T-wave peaks and boundaries, but also for the accurate estimation of waveforms for each analysis window. This can be useful for some ECG analysis that require wave morphology information.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Electrocardiography","Bayesian methods","Markov processes","Signal

The new source of variability, christened work-function (WF) variation (WFV), is caused by the dependence of metal WF on the orientation of its grains. The experimentally measured data reported in this paper confirm the existence of such variations in both planar and nonplanar high-k metal-gate transistors. As a result of WFV, the WFs of metal gates are statistical distributions instead of deterministic values. In this paper, the key parameters of such WF distributions are analytically modeled by identifying the physical dimensions of the devices and properties of materials used in the fabrication. It is shown that WFV can be modeled by a multinomial distribution where the key parameters of its probability distribution function can be calculated in terms of the aforementioned parameters. The analysis reveals that WFV will contribute a key source of V_th variability in emerging generations of metal-gate devices. Using the proposed framework, one can investigate the implications of WFV for process, device, and circuit design, which are discussed in Part II.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Grain-Orientation Induced Work Function Variation in Nanoscale Metal-Gate Transistors\u2014Part I: Modeling, Analysis, and Experimental Validation","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","doi":"10.1109/TED.2010.2063191","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","pdfPath":"/iel5/16/5580182/05575410.pdf","startPage":"2504","endPage":"2514","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TED.2010.2063191","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5580182","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575410","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575410/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Oct.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Grain-Orientation Induced Work Function Variation in Nanoscale Metal-Gate Transistors\u2014Part I: Modeling, Analysis, and Experimental Validation","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"57","issue":"10","htmlLink":"/document/5575410/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","publicationDate":"Oct. 2010","accessionNumber":"11533853","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Grain-Orientation Induced Work Function Variation in Nanoscale Metal-Gate Transistors\u2014Part I: Modeling, Analysis, and Experimental Validation","sourcePdf":"ted-banerjee-2063191-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.12392S","chronDate":"Oct.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"16","isNumber":"5580182","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"16","citationCount":"125","xplore-issue":"5580182","articleId":"5575410","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5575419,"authors":[{"name":"Chi-Huang Lu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engineering, Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Taichung, Taiwan"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/41/5873561/5575419/5575419-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Chi-Huang Lu (M'98) received the B.S. degree in automatic engineering from Feng Chia University, Taichung, Taiwan, in 1989 and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from National Chung Hsing University, Taichung, in 2000 and 2007, respectively.","He is currently an Associate Professor with the Department of Electrical Engineering, Hsiuping Institute of Technology, Taichung.

In the proposed DTC, the amplitudes of torque and flux errors are differentiated and employed to regulate the amplitude and angle of the output voltage vectors online, which are finally synthesized by space-vector modulation (SVM). Two simple formulas are developed to derive the amplitude and angle of the commanding voltage vectors from the errors of torque and flux only. The conventional switching table and hysteresis controllers are eliminated, and a fixed switching frequency is obtained with the help of SVM. Stator flux is estimated from an improved voltage model, which is based on a low-pass filter with compensations of the amplitude and phase. The proposed DTC is comparatively investigated with the existing SVM-DTC from the aspects of theory analysis, computer simulation, and experimental validation. The simulation and experimental results prove that the proposed DTC is very simple and provides excellent steady-state response, quick dynamic performance, and strong robustness against external disturbance and control-parameter variations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Simple Method to Reduce Torque Ripple in Direct Torque-Controlled Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor by Using Vectors With Variable Amplitude and Angle","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","doi":"10.1109/TIE.2010.2076413","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics","pdfPath":"/iel5/41/5873561/05575420.pdf","startPage":"2848","endPage":"2859","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TIE.2010.2076413","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5873561","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575420","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575420/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"July  2011","displayDocTitle":"A Simple Method to Reduce Torque Ripple in Direct Torque-Controlled Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor by Using Vectors With Variable Amplitude and Angle","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"7","htmlLink":"/document/5575420/","dateOfInsertion":"13 June 2011","publicationDate":"July 2011","accessionNumber":"12049309","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Simple Method to Reduce Torque Ripple in Direct Torque-Controlled Permanent-Magnet Synchronous Motor by Using Vectors With Variable Amplitude and Angle","sourcePdf":"tie-zhang-2076413-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.095474S","chronDate":"July  2011","xplore-pub-id":"41","isNumber":"5873561","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"41","citationCount":"152","xplore-issue":"5873561","articleId":"5575420","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5575423,"authors":[{"name":"Antonios Oikonomopoulos","affiliation":["Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5733951/5575423/5575423-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Antonios Oikonomopoulos (S'00\u2013M'10) received the B.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the Electrical Engineering Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, in 2002, the M.Sc. degree in media and knowledge engineering from the Electrical Engineering Department, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, in 2006, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Computing Department, Imperial College London, U.K., in 2010.","Currently, he is a Research Associate at the Computing Department of Imperial College London, U.K. His research interests lie in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition, and more specifically in human activity analysis, image and video retrieval, human-machine interaction and digital image processing.","Dr. Oikonomopoulos was a recipient of the Greek State Scholarships Foundation (I.K.Y.) from 2003 to 2007."]},"firstName":"Antonios","lastName":"Oikonomopoulos","id":"37565373400"},{"name":"Ioannis Patras","affiliation":["Faculty of Electrical Engineering Department of Computing Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Twente, Netherlands"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/83/5733951/5575423/5575423-photo-2-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis (Yiannis) Patras (S'97\u2013M'02) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in computer science from the Computer Science Department, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece, in 1994 and in 1997, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands, in 2001.","He has been a Postdoctorate Researcher in the area of multimedia analysis at the University of Amsterdam, and a Postdoctorate Researcher in the area of vision-based human machine interaction at TU Delft.

The main contribution of the proposed method is the use of an implicit representation of the spatiotemporal shape of the activity which relies on the spatiotemporal localization of characteristic ensembles of feature descriptors. Evidence for the spatiotemporal localization of the activity is accumulated in a probabilistic spatiotemporal voting scheme. The local nature of the proposed voting framework allows us to deal with multiple activities taking place in the same scene, as well as with activities in the presence of clutter and occlusion. We use boosting in order to select characteristic ensembles per class. This leads to a set of class specific codebooks where each codeword is an ensemble of features. During training, we store the spatial positions of the codeword ensembles with respect to a set of reference points, as well as their temporal positions with respect to the start and end of the action instance. During testing, each activated codeword ensemble casts votes concerning the spatiotemporal position and extend of the action, using the information that was stored during training. Mean Shift mode estimation in the voting space provides the most probable hypotheses concerning the localization of the subjects at each frame, as well as the extend of the activities depicted in the image sequences.

We compare and evaluate the use of mutual information (MI) and joint entropy (JE) between feature vectors extracted from the anatomical and PET images as priors in PET reconstruction. Scale-space theory provides a framework for the analysis of images at different levels of detail, and we use this approach to define feature vectors that emphasize prominent boundaries in the anatomical and functional images, and attach less importance to detail and noise that is less likely to be correlated in the two images. Through simulations that model the best case scenario of perfect agreement between the anatomical and functional images, and a more realistic situation with a real magnetic resonance image and a PET phantom that has partial volumes and a smooth variation of intensities, we evaluate the performance of MI and JE based priors in comparison to a Gaussian quadratic prior, which does not use any anatomical information. We also apply this method to clinical brain scan data using Fallypride, a tracer that binds to dopamine receptors and therefore localizes mainly in the striatum. We present an efficient method of computing these priors and their derivatives based on fast Fourier transforms that reduce the complexity of their convolution-like expressions. Our results indicate that while sensitive to initialization and choice of hyperparameters, information theoretic priors can reconstruct images with higher contrast and superior quantitation than quadratic priors.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"March  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575429/","volume":"30","issue":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5575429/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"March 2011","accessionNumber":"11837861","pubMedId":"20851790","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"28 February 2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"PET Image Reconstruction Using Information Theoretic Anatomical Priors","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"PET Image Reconstruction Using Information Theoretic Anatomical Priors","sourcePdf":"tmi-leahy-2076827-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.113531S","chronDate":"March  2011","xplore-pub-id":"42","isNumber":"5721862","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"42","citationCount":"86","xplore-issue":"5721862","articleId":"5575429","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5575432,"authors":[{"name":"Somsubhra Sharangi","affiliation":["School of Computing Science, Simon Fraser University, Surrey, BC, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/6046/5689344/5575432/5575432-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Somsubhra Sharangi received the B.Tech. degree from the University of Kalyani, Kalyani, India, in 2003 and the M.Tech. degree from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India, in 2005.

In this paper, we consider WiMAX networks that transmit multiple video streams encoded in scalable manner to mobile receivers using the MBS feature. We focus on two research problems in such networks: 1) maximizing the video quality and 2) minimizing energy consumption for mobile receivers. We formulate and solve the substream selection problem to maximize the video quality, which arises when multiple scalable video streams are broadcast to mobile receivers with limited resources. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, and design a polynomial time approximation algorithm to solve it. We prove that the solutions computed by our algorithm are always within a small constant factor from the optimal solutions. In addition, we extend our algorithm to reduce the energy consumption of mobile receivers. This is done by transmitting the selected substreams in bursts, which allows mobile receivers to turn off their wireless interfaces to save energy. We show how our algorithm constructs burst transmission schedules that reduce energy consumption without sacrificing the video quality. Using extensive simulation and mathematical analysis, we show that the proposed algorithm: 1) is efficient in terms of execution time, 2) achieves high radio resource utilization, 3) maximizes the received video quality, and 4) minimizes the energy consumption for mobile receivers.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Feb.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575432/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","volume":"13","issue":"1","accessionNumber":"11759407","publicationDate":"Feb. 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575432/","dateOfInsertion":"17 January 2011","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Energy-Efficient Multicasting of Scalable Video Streams Over WiMAX Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Energy-Efficient Multicasting of Scalable Video Streams Over WiMAX Networks","sourcePdf":"tmm-hefeeda-2076799-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.137166S","chronDate":"Feb.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"6046","isNumber":"5689344","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"6046","citationCount":"57","xplore-issue":"5689344","articleId":"5575432","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5575433,"authors":[{"name":"Masoud Karimi-Ghartemani","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Queen's University, Kingston, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/61/5673376/5575433/5575433-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Masoud Karimi-Ghartemani (SM'09) received the B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in electrical engineering from Isfahan University of Technology, Isfahan, Iran, in 1993 and 1995, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2004.","He joined Sharif University of Technology as a Faculty Member in 2005.

A single target year is considered with demand variations modeled through blocks. The strategic behavior of the producer is represented through a bilevel model: the upper-level considers both investment decisions and strategic production actions and the lower-level corresponds to market clearing.

Subsequently, dynamic surface control (DSC)-based adaptive neural network (NN) controller is designed to overcome the repeated differentiation of the control input that is observed in the conventional backstepping approach. The NNs are utilized to approximate the unknown subsystem and the interconnection dynamics. By using novel online NN weight update laws with quadratic error terms, the closed-loop signals are shown to be locally asymptotically stable via Lyapunov stability analysis, even in the presence of NN approximation errors in contrast with other NN techniques where a bounded stability is normally assured. Simulation results on the IEEE 14-bus power system with generator excitation control are provided to show the effectiveness of the approach in damping oscillations that occur after disturbances are removed. The end result is a nonlinear decentralized adaptive state-feedback excitation controller for damping power systems oscillations in the presence of uncertain interconnection terms.","doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2059717","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5753358/05575438.pdf","startPage":"669","endPage":"680","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2059717","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753358","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Power System Stabilization Using Adaptive Neural Network-Based Dynamic Surface Control","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575438","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575438/","displayDocTitle":"Power System Stabilization Using Adaptive Neural Network-Based Dynamic Surface Control","volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2011","accessionNumber":"11961090","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575438/","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Power System Stabilization Using Adaptive Neural Network-Based Dynamic Surface Control","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-mehraeen-2059717-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.094897S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5753358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"63","xplore-issue":"5753358","articleId":"5575438","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-27"},{"_id":5575439,"authors":[{"name":"Lidong Zhang","affiliation":["ABB Power Systems AB, Ludvika, Sweden"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/59/5753358/5575439/5575439-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Lidong Zhang (M'07) received the B.Sc. degree from the North China Electric Power University, Baoding, China, in 1991 and the Tech.Lic degree from Chalmers University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1999.

In this paper, power-synchronization control is investigated for VSC-HVDC links connected to another type of weak ac system, i.e., low-inertia or island systems. As an example, a linear model of a typical island system feeding by a VSC-HVDC link, including a synchronous generator, an induction motor, and some passive loads, is developed for tuning the control parameters of the VSC-HVDC link. Time simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC demonstrate that VSC-HVDC systems using power-synchronization control are flexible for various network conditions, such as large-ac-system connection, island systems, or passive networks. The time simulations also show that power-synchronization control can seamlessly handle transitions between operation modes, as well as ride through ac-system faults in all network conditions.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Power conversion","Voltage control","Synchronous generators","Mathematical model","HVDC transmission"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fault diagnosis","HVDC power convertors","HVDC power transmission","induction motors","power control","power transmission control","synchronous generators"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["VSC-HVDC links","power-synchronization control","grid-connected voltage-source converters","high-voltage direct-current transmission","high-impedance weak ac systems","low-inertia systems","island systems","synchronous generator","induction motor","passive loads","PSCAD-EMTDC","large-ac-system connection","operation modes","ac-system faults"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Control","converters","high-voltage direct-current (HVDC)","power systems","stability"]}],"doi":"10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2070085","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Power Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/59/5753358/05575439.pdf","startPage":"783","endPage":"793","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5753358","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPWRS.2010.2070085","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Modeling and Control of VSC-HVDC Links Connected to Island Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575439","pubTopics":[{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Modeling and Control of VSC-HVDC Links Connected to Island Systems","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575439/","volume":"26","issue":"2","publicationDate":"May 2011","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575439/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11961091","dateOfInsertion":"21 April 2011","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","chronOrPublicationDate":"May  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Modeling and Control of VSC-HVDC Links Connected to Island Systems","sourcePdf":"tpwrs-zhang-2070085-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.083213S","chronDate":"May  2011","xplore-pub-id":"59","isNumber":"5753358","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"59","citationCount":"134","xplore-issue":"5753358","articleId":"5575439","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-30"},{"_id":5575440,"authors":[{"name":"Houman Homayoun","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, UCI, Irvine, CA, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/92/6017244/5575440/5575440-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Houman Homayoun (M'10) received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2003, the M.S. degree in computer engineering from University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada, in 2005, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of California, Irvine (UC-Irvine), in 2010.","His research is on power-temperature and reliability-aware memory and processor design optimizations and spans the areas of computer architecture, circuit design and VLSI-CAD, where he has published over 30 technical papers on the subject.

In recent years, many circuit and micro-architectural innovations have been proposed to reduce power in many individual processor units. However, many of these prior efforts have concentrated on the approaches which require considerable redesign and verification efforts. Also it has not been investigated whether these techniques can be combined. Therefore a challenge is to find a centralized and simple algorithm which can address power issues for more than one unit, and ultimately the entire chip and comes with the least amount of redesign and verification efforts, the lowest possible design risk and the least hardware overhead. This paper proposes such a centralized approach that attempts to simultaneously reduce power in processor units with highest dissipation: reorder buffer, instruction queue, load/store queue, and register files. It is based on an observation that utilization for the aforementioned units varies significantly, during cache miss period. Therefore we propose to dynamically adjust the size and thus power dissipation of these resources during such periods. Circuit level modifications required for such resource adaptation are presented. Simulation results show a substantial power reduction at the cost of a negligible performance impact and a small hardware overhead.","doi":"10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2064185","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/92/6017244/05575440.pdf","startPage":"2081","endPage":"2094","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TVLSI.2010.2064185","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=6017244","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575440","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Reducing Power in All Major CAM and SRAM-Based Processor Units via Centralized, Dynamic Resource Size Management","pubTopics":[{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575440/","displayDocTitle":"Reducing Power in All Major CAM and SRAM-Based Processor Units via Centralized, Dynamic Resource Size Management","volume":"19","issue":"11","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575440/","publicationDate":"Nov. 2011","isJournal":true,"dateOfInsertion":"12 September 2011","accessionNumber":"12228014","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Reducing Power in All Major CAM and SRAM-Based Processor Units via Centralized, Dynamic Resource Size Management","sourcePdf":"tvlsi-homayoun-2064185-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.201418S","chronDate":"Nov.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"92","isNumber":"6017244","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"92","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"6017244","articleId":"5575440","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5575446,"authors":[{"name":"Shiliang Liu","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, USA"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7729/5941043/5575446/5575446-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Shiliang Liu (S'10) received the M.S. degree in computer science from Michigan Technological University, Houghton, in 2008, and the B.S. degree in chemical engineering from Tianjin University, Tianjin, China, in 2001.","He is currently working toward the Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN.

This salvo performance can improve the hit rate and the destructive power on the target. The railgun has two barrels stacked in series and is powered by a pulse power. In order to verify its salvo performance, we conducted a 3-D eddy current electromagnetic field simulation with the finite-element numerical method. The simulation results showed that the self-inductance gradient of each pair of rails is not always constant; the value depends on the armatures' position, particularly when the armatures are closer to the breech. Moreover, we found that, when the two armatures are at different positions, the values of the mutual-inductance gradient of the two pairs of rails are different . Subsequent circuit simulation of the launching process showed that the propulsive force acting on the armature in the front is less than that on the armature behind. We discovered that the configuration of the railgun will facilitate the synchronization during the launching process, even if the two armatures have different masses, move under different frictions, or start at different positions. We further tested a corresponding scale model of the railgun. The experiment led to the conclusion that the double-projectile railgun has good salvo performance.","doi":"10.1109/TPS.2010.2070069","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science","pdfPath":"/iel5/27/5680667/05575448.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TPS.2010.2070069","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5680667","startPage":"203","endPage":"209","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Salvo Performance Analysis of Double-Projectile Railgun","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575448","pubTopics":[{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Salvo Performance Analysis of Double-Projectile Railgun","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575448/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"39","issue":"1","publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11733368","dateOfInsertion":"06 January 2011","htmlLink":"/document/5575448/","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Salvo Performance Analysis of Double-Projectile Railgun","sourcePdf":"tps-yujiao-2070069-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.0853S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"27","isNumber":"5680667","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"27","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5680667","articleId":"5575448","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5575449,"authors":[{"name":"Paul P.-Y.

The research is principally motivated by the need for offline and online motion planning for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). For UAVs operating in large dynamic uncertain 4-D environments, the motion plan consists of a sequence of connected linear tracks (or trajectory segments). The track angle and velocity are important parameters that are often restricted by assumptions and a grid geometry in conventional motion planners. Many existing planners also fail to incorporate multiple decision criteria and constraints such as wind, fuel, dynamic obstacles, and the rules of the air. It is shown that MSA* finds a cost optimal solution using variable length, angle, and velocity trajectory segments. These segments are approximated with a grid-based cell sequence that provides an inherent tolerance to uncertainty. The computational efficiency is achieved by using variable successor operators to create a multiresolution memory-efficient lattice sampling structure. The simulation studies on the UAV flight planning problem show that MSA* meets the time constraints of online replanning and finds paths of equivalent cost but in a quarter of the time (on average) of a vector neighborhood-based A*.","doi":"10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2061225","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2061225","startPage":"621","endPage":"634","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","pdfPath":"/iel5/3477/5767816/05575449.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B (Cybernetics)","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5767816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Multi-Objective Four-Dimensional Vehicle Motion Planning in Large Dynamic Environments","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June  2011","displayDocTitle":"Multi-Objective Four-Dimensional Vehicle Motion Planning in Large Dynamic Environments","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2011","dateOfInsertion":"16 May 2011","volume":"41","issue":"3","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575449/","accessionNumber":"12004739","pubMedId":"20851795","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575449/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Multi-Objective Four-Dimensional Vehicle Motion Planning in Large Dynamic Environments","sourcePdf":"tsmcb-wu-2061225-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.093649S","chronDate":"June  2011","xplore-pub-id":"3477","isNumber":"5767816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"3477","citationCount":"64","xplore-issue":"5767816","articleId":"5575449","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5575450,"authors":[{"name":"Lei Huang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Lei","lastName":"Huang","id":"38195450800"},{"name":"Q.

In this correspondence, the problem is tackled in the framework of information theoretic criterion, which enables the turbo decoding to properly work in a changing SNR environment.

We study a particular class of distributed consensus algorithms based on damped updates, and using the ordinary differential equation method, we prove that the updates converge almost surely to the consensus average for various models of perturbation of data exchanged between nodes. The convergence is not asymptotic in the size of the network. Our analysis applies to various types of stochastic disturbances to the updates, including errors in update calculations, dithered quantization and imperfect data exchange among nodes. Under a suitable stability condition, we prove that the error between estimated and true averages is asymptotically Gaussian, and we show how the asymptotic covariance is specified by the graph Laplacian. For additive perturbations, we show how the scaling of the asymptotic MSE is controlled by the spectral gap of the Laplacian.","doi":"10.1109/TSP.2010.2077282","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TSP.2010.2077282","startPage":"373","endPage":"385","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","pdfPath":"/iel5/78/5662471/05575452.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5662471","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Network-Based Consensus Averaging With General Noisy Channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","displayDocTitle":"Network-Based Consensus Averaging With General Noisy Channels","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","dateOfInsertion":"17 December 2010","volume":"59","issue":"1","isJournal":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575452/","accessionNumber":"11704193","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575452/","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Network-Based Consensus Averaging With General Noisy Channels","sourcePdf":"tsp-rajagopal-2077282-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.086569S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"78","isNumber":"5662471","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"78","citationCount":"50","xplore-issue":"5662471","articleId":"5575452","onlineDate":"16 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"USGov","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5575473,"authors":[{"name":"Zhongxian Qu","affiliation":["College of Science, Northeast Dianli University, Jilin, China"],"firstName":"Zhongxian","lastName":"Qu","id":"38194688200"},{"name":"Jingbo Zhang","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Technology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China"],"firstName":"Jingbo","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37657596800"},{"name":"Zijun Feng","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Information Technology, Northeast Normal University, Changchun, China","School of Electronic Engineering, University of Electronic Science and Technology, Chengdu, China"],"firstName":"Zijun","lastName":"Feng","id":"37675056200"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7779-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-6301"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2159-631X"}],"articleNumber":"5575473","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":403},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Discrete wavelet transforms","Image fusion","Pixel","Principal component analysis","Wavelet analysis","Frequency measurement"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["discrete wavelet transforms","image fusion"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multifocus image fusion algorithm","two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform","spatial frequency","2D DWT","image processing"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["image fusion","2-D DWT","SF","multifocus"]}],"abstract":"Image fusion is a process of integrating two or more images into a single image with more details and information. The different focus images involve different details according to changing the lens of camera. Recently, the two-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (2-D DWT) is applied widely to image processing field. A novel method is proposed for multifocus image fusion based on 2-D DWT. In order to select adapted pixels effectively from the source images, spatial frequency (SF) is adopted to choose maximum value from the high pass subbands, which decomposed using one-level 2-D DWT. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed fusion algorithm can obtain the resultant image well, both in visual effect and objective evaluation criteria.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Image Fusion Algorithm Based on Two-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform and Spatial Frequency","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","doi":"10.1109/FCST.2010.63","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575320/5575458/05575473.pdf","startPage":"537","endPage":"540","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCST.2010.63","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575458","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575473","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575473/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Image Fusion Algorithm Based on Two-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform and Spatial Frequency","conferenceDate":"18-22 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575473/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11531034","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Image Fusion Algorithm Based on Two-Dimensional Discrete Wavelet Transform and Spatial Frequency","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"4139a537.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070891S","chronDate":"18-22 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575320","isNumber":"5575458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575320","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5575458","articleId":"5575473","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5575498,"authors":[{"name":"Assel Akzhalova","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Assel","lastName":"Akzhalova","id":"38096875100"},{"name":"Iman Poernomo","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, King''s College, London, UK"],"firstName":"Iman","lastName":"Poernomo","id":"37266993000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8199-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4129-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-3818"}],"articleNumber":"5575498","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":168},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575498","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Quality of service","Unified modeling language","Adaptation model","Service oriented architecture","Monitoring","Computational modeling","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dynamic programming","quality of service","software architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["model driven approach","dynamic service composition","QoS constraints","SOA systems","optimal service composition policies","SLA metrics","dynamic programming","service level agreement","service oriented architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Service Oriented Architectures","Model Driven Architecture","optimization","policy generation","Quality of Service"]}],"abstract":"The problem of dynamic service composition of SOA systems based on QoS requirements may be framed as one of automatic generation of policies according to desirable level of QoS characteristics.

Services are playing the essential role in cloud computing as cloud computing refers to \u201cboth the applications delivered as services over the Internet and the hardware and systems software in the datacenters that provide those services\u201d. Therefore, service-oriented architecture should play an important role in cloud computing. In addition, one of the characteristics of cloud computing is to make services available on demand. Given a group of services, different demands may involve different set of services and in different order. This is related to services reuse and composition. However, existing methods only solve service composition in a binary manner: Either a solution exists or no solutions at all. In this paper, we propose the concept of virtual services, which physically do not exist, but are conceptually treated in the same way as physical services. Virtual services are useful when traditional service compositions fail. Virtual services can connect the existing physical services and enable the composition process to succeed. The specifications of virtual services will provide valuable information about how to develop real services to meet the requirements of the given demand. In this paper, we present algorithms that can help identify the virtual services in the case of composition failure and provide the specification of virtual services for further analysis and development.","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2010.125","publicationTitle":"2010 6th World Congress on Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th World Congress on Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575322/5575460/05575563.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2010.125","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575460","startPage":"467","endPage":"472","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Virtual Services in Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575563","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Virtual Services in Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575563/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535240","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5575563/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Virtual Services in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4129a467.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.096871S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575322","isNumber":"5575460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575322","citationCount":"13","xplore-issue":"5575460","articleId":"5575563","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5575569,"authors":[{"name":"Shuo Liu","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Shuo","lastName":"Liu","id":"37280147300"},{"name":"Gang Quan","affiliation":["Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA"],"firstName":"Gang","lastName":"Quan","id":"37282717200"},{"name":"Shangping Ren","affiliation":["Computer Science Department, Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, IL, USA"],"firstName":"Shangping","lastName":"Ren","id":"37301926900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8199-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4129-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-3818"}],"articleNumber":"5575569","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":43,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1260},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Scheduling","Real time systems","Cloud computing","Scheduling algorithm","Biological system modeling","Clouds"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","processor scheduling","real-time systems"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["online scheduling","real-time service","cloud computing","single time utility function","earliest deadline first"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Real-time service","on-line scheduling","time utility functions"]}],"abstract":"In this paper, we introduce a novel utility accrual scheduling algorithm for real-time cloud computing services. The real-time tasks are scheduled non-preemptively with the objective to maximize the total utility. The most unique characteristic of our approach is that, different from the traditional utility accrual approach that works under one single time utility function (TUF), we have two different TUFs-a profit TUF and a penalty TUF-associated with each task at the same time, to model the real-time applications for cloud computing that need not only to reward the early completions but also to penalize the abortions or deadline misses of real-time tasks. Our experimental results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform the traditional scheduling algorithms such as the Earliest Deadline First (EDF), the traditional utility accrual scheduling algorithm and an early scheduling approach based on the similar model.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On-Line Scheduling of Real-Time Services for Cloud Computing","publicationTitle":"2010 6th World Congress on Services","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2010.109","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th World Congress on Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575322/5575460/05575569.pdf","startPage":"459","endPage":"464","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2010.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575460","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575569","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575569/","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"On-Line Scheduling of Real-Time Services for Cloud Computing","conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5575569/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535242","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On-Line Scheduling of Real-Time Services for Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4129a459.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065903S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575322","isNumber":"5575460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575322","citationCount":"43","xplore-issue":"5575460","articleId":"5575569","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5575620,"authors":[{"name":"Mashhur Sattorov","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Mokwon University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Mashhur","lastName":"Sattorov","id":"38195187400"},{"name":"Jae-Myeong Choi","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Mokwon University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Jae-Myeong","lastName":"Choi","id":"37656337500"},{"name":"Heau-Jo Kang","affiliation":["Division of Computer Engineering, Mokwon University, Daejeon, South Korea"],"firstName":"Heau-Jo","lastName":"Kang","id":"37655006500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7713-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7710-4","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-7712-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2159-1520"}],"articleNumber":"5575620","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":112},"abstract":"4G wireless communication systems use OFDM modulation technique in order to provide reliable transmission in a propagation area.

The affordance of mobile technology can be exploited to make education more pervasive and equitable. It expedites the pedagogical shift from teacher-centered to student-centered learning, enabling a ubiquitous learning environment that will promote students' engagement through multiple modalities. We explore ways to maximize the power of mobile learning technologies to increase enrollment, reduce attrition, improve teaching efficiency, and enable green technology without sacrificing the quality and placing extra burden on faculty. As mobile learning technologies pose challenges to most educational practitioners, a generic mobile learning framework was developed to address this issue. Our hybrid application approach utilizes mobile devices' native functions and existing Web 2.0 applications. Additional applications to fit in the framework are created to allow non-technical instructors to develop mobile learning content to engage student learners in informal settings.","doi":"10.1109/FCST.2010.109","publicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Fifth International Conference on Frontier of Computer Science and Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575320/5575458/05575671.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FCST.2010.109","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575458","startPage":"78","endPage":"82","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Affordance of Ubiquitous Learning through Cloud Computing","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5575671","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Affordance of Ubiquitous Learning through Cloud Computing","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575671/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"18-22 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11531049","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5575671/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Affordance of Ubiquitous Learning through Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"4139a078.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.056677S","chronDate":"18-22 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575320","isNumber":"5575458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575320","citationCount":"11","xplore-issue":"5575458","articleId":"5575671","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5575709,"authors":[{"name":"Thorsten Jungeblut","affiliation":["Heinz Nixdorf Institute University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Thorsten","lastName":"Jungeblut","id":"38194321200"},{"name":"Gregor Sievers","affiliation":["Heinz Nixdorf Institute University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Gregor","lastName":"Sievers","id":"38194321500"},{"name":"Mario Porrmann","affiliation":["Heinz Nixdorf Institute University of Paderborn, Germany"],"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"Porrmann","id":"37266925900"},{"name":"Ulrich R\u00fcckert","affiliation":["Cognitive Interaction Technology, Center of Excellence, Bielefeld University, Germany","Cognitive Interaction Technology Center of Excellence Bielefeld University, Germany"],"firstName":"Ulrich","lastName":"R\u00fcckert","id":"37267463400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8133-0","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5575709","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":8,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":275},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Program processors","VLIW","Registers","Memory management","Hardware","Object oriented modeling"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["instruction sets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["design space exploration","memory subsystems","VLIW architectures","processor architectures","two-stage tool flow","cryptography","very long instruction word"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Design Space Exploration","VLIW","CoreVA","Cache","Memory Subsystem"]}],"abstract":"In this work we present a design space exploration of the memory subsystem of our configurable CoreVA VLIW architecture. The development of resource efficient processor architectures is based on a two-stage tool flow using a high-level processor specification as a reference. We evaluate several memory configurations like one memory port or two memory ports, as well as different write-miss-allocation modes. Applications ranging from LTE protocol stack over baseband processing up to cryptography and multimedia are evaluated in terms of execution time and energy efficiency. Analyses have shown that the application specific configuration of the memory subsystem can improve energy by up to 25%.

Next to cloud computing, the paradigm of Service-oriented Architectures emerged to facilitate the provisioning of functionality as services. While both concepts are complementary, their combination enables the flexible provisioning and consumption of independently scalable services. These approaches come along with new security risks that require the usage of identity and access management solutions and information protection. The requirements concerning security mechanisms, protocols and options are stated in security policies that configure the interaction between services and clients in a system. In this paper, we present our cloud-based Service Security Lab that supports the on-demand creation and orchestration of composed applications and services. Our cloud platform enables the testing, monitoring and analysis of Web Services regarding different security configurations, concepts and infrastructure components. Since security policies are hard to understand and even harder to codify, we foster a model-driven approach to simplify the creation of security configurations. Our model-driven approach enables the definition of security requirements at the modelling layer and facilitates a transformation based on security configuration patterns.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575460","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/SERVICES.2010.90","publicationTitle":"2010 6th World Congress on Services","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 6th World Congress on Services","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575322/5575460/05575779.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"122","doi":"10.1109/SERVICES.2010.90","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"The Service Security Lab: A Model-Driven Platform to Compose and Explore Service Security in the Cloud","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"5-10 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"The Service Security Lab: A Model-Driven Platform to Compose and Explore Service Security in the Cloud","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"5-10 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5575779/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11535161","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575779/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The Service Security Lab: A Model-Driven Platform to Compose and Explore Service Security in the Cloud","confLoc":"Miami, FL, USA","sourcePdf":"4129a115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.045025S","chronDate":"5-10 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575322","isNumber":"5575460","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575322","citationCount":"22","xplore-issue":"5575460","articleId":"5575779","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5575840,"authors":[{"name":"Zhixiong Chen","affiliation":["Cybersecurity, School of Liberal Arts, Mercy College, USA"],"firstName":"Zhixiong","lastName":"Chen","id":"37421296200"},{"name":"John Yoon","affiliation":["Cybersecurity, School of Liberal Arts, Mercy College, USA"],"firstName":"John","lastName":"Yoon","id":"37065462000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8199-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4129-7","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2378-3818"}],"articleNumber":"5575840","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":18,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":1853},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clouds","Communities","Cloud computing","Security","Computational modeling","Availability","Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information technology","Internet","security of data"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["IT auditing","cloud computing security","data flow","cloud deployment model","cloud service model"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Secure Cloud Computing","IT Compkiance","IT Auditing"]}],"abstract":"In this paper we discuss the evolvement of cloud computing paradigm and present a framework for secure cloud computing through IT auditing.

With the disregard of security factors, existing message scheduling schemes expose critical messages to security threats, especially by confidentiality attacks. Incorporating confidentiality improvement into message scheduling, we investigate the problem of scheduling periodic messages with both time-critical and security-critical requirements. Risk-based security profit model is built to quantitatively measure the security quality of messages. For a set of periodic messages, a Security-Slack based Heuristic Algorithm (SSHA) is proposed to judiciously allocate a slack time to the most suitable confidentiality level for each security-critical message. Experimental results evaluate the efficiency of SSHA. Compared to other heuristic schemes, specifically, the average security improvement can achieve up to 57.8% for SSHA.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575936/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-22 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11531009","htmlLink":"/document/5575936/","conferenceDate":"18-22 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Periodic Real-Time Message Scheduling for Confidentiality-Aware Cyber-Physical System in Wireless Networks","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Periodic Real-Time Message Scheduling for Confidentiality-Aware Cyber-Physical System in Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Changchun, China","sourcePdf":"4139a355.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.053181S","chronDate":"18-22 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575320","isNumber":"5575458","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575320","citationCount":"10","xplore-issue":"5575458","articleId":"5575936","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5575953,"authors":[{"name":"Vishwakarma Singh","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, UCSB, USA"],"firstName":"Vishwakarma","lastName":"Singh","id":"37404015000"},{"name":"Wenyu Jiang","affiliation":["Dolby Laboratories Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Wenyu","lastName":"Jiang","id":"37829231100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7964-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5575953","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":6,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":97},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Artificial neural networks","Random access memory","Databases","Accuracy","Algorithm design and analysis","Nearest neighbor searches","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["approximation theory","query processing","random-access storage","statistical distributions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["p-stable distribution","random access memory","query results","approximate similarity search","vote count based algorithm","RAM"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["High Dimensional Space","Nearest Neighbor Search","Hardware","Fast"]}],"abstract":"Similarity search in very high dimensions is vital for many scientific research activities as well as real applications.

It is proved that the projection of every formal concept of a n-SDPFC on the i-th original formal context is also a concept of the corresponding original formal context, and under some given conditions, the product of n formal concepts of the n corresponding original formal contexts is a concept of the n-SDPFC. An implications between attributes of an n-SDPFC can be obtained if we know all of the implications between attributes in the original formal contexts, since it can be formed component-wise, and vice verse. A judgement theorem for irreducible elements in the concept lattice of an n-SDPFC is obtained, which is based on the irreducible elements in the n original concept lattices. Then we propose a method for the determination of the attribute characteristics in an n-SPDFC, which is based on the attribute characteristics of the original formal contexts. And this method makes it more easier to find out all of the attribute characteristics in an n-SDPFC.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GrC.2010.108","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575317/5575937/05575988.pdf","startPage":"286","endPage":"291","doi":"10.1109/GrC.2010.108","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"n-Strong-Direct-Product Formal Context","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"n-Strong-Direct-Product Formal Context","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5575988/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11534737","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5575988/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"n-Strong-Direct-Product Formal Context","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4161a286.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064925S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575317","isNumber":"5575937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575317","xplore-issue":"5575937","articleId":"5575988","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5576052,"authors":[{"name":"Ricardo Martinez","affiliation":["Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Ricardo","lastName":"Martinez","id":"37673926100"},{"name":"Antonio Rodriguez","affiliation":["Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Antonio","lastName":"Rodriguez","id":"37631499000"},{"name":"Oscar Castillo","affiliation":["Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Tijuana, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Castillo","id":"37271198900"},{"name":"Luis T.

This paper aims at providing theoretical explanations to these experimental observations. Analysis has shown that the additional degrees of freedom provided by the footprint of uncertainty enable an IT2 fuzzy PI controller to emulate a variable gain PI controller around the origin, and these PI gains are smaller than those of the baseline type-1 fuzzy PI controller, consequently, the same amount of disturbance will cause a smaller control signal change for an IT2 fuzzy PI controller, and hence reduces the risk of oscillation. The results in this paper enable us to connect traditional PI controllers with IT2 fuzzy PI controllers. Based on the closed-form equivalent PI gains, controller design rules in one domain may be transferred to the other domain, and it is possible to develop new control laws by combining the merits of both traditional PI controllers and IT2 fuzzy PI controllers.","doi":"10.1109/GrC.2010.112","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575317/5575937/05576087.pdf","startPage":"802","endPage":"807","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575937","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/GrC.2010.112","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"14-16 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Interval Type-2 Fuzzy PI Controllers: Why They are More Robust","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5576087/","conferenceDate":"14-16 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11531186","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5576087/","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Interval Type-2 Fuzzy PI Controllers: Why They are More Robust","confLoc":"San Jose, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4161a802.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049213S","chronDate":"14-16 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575317","isNumber":"5575937","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575317","citationCount":"42","xplore-issue":"5575937","articleId":"5576087","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5576130,"authors":[{"name":"Denisse Hidalgo","affiliation":["Universidad Autonoma de Baja California, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Denisse","lastName":"Hidalgo","id":"37694744300"},{"name":"Patricia Melin","affiliation":["Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Patricia","lastName":"Melin","id":"37271192400"},{"name":"Oscar Castillo","affiliation":["Tijuana Institute of Technology, Tijuana, Mexico"],"firstName":"Oscar","lastName":"Castillo","id":"37271198900"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7964-1","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5576130","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":191},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5576130","abstract":"In this paper we describe an evolutionary method for the optimization of type-2 fuzzy systems based on the level of uncertainty.

Many methods have been proposed for solving this problem such as Fisherface and Null Space LDA (N-LDA), but these methods are overfitted to the training set and inevitably lose some useful discriminative information in many cases. To effectively utilize nearly all useful discriminative information, a not completely random sampling framework for the integration of multiple features is developed. However, this method has the following main disadvantage: By directly employing feature extraction, the newly constructed variables may contain lots of information originated from those redundant features in the original space. So, in this paper, we introduce a new random sampling LDA by incorporating feature selection for face recognition, that is, some redundant features are removed using the given feature selection methods at first, and then PCA is employed, finally we use random sampling to generate multiple feature subsets. Along this, corresponding weak LDA classifiers are naturally generated and an integrated classifier is developed using a fusion rule. Experiments on 4 face datasets (AR, ORL, Yale, YaleB) show the effectiveness of our algorithm.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5576298","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2010.5576317","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564178/5576298/05576317.pdf","startPage":"180","endPage":"185","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2010.5576317","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Random sampling LDA incorporating feature selection for face recognition","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","displayDocTitle":"Random sampling LDA incorporating feature selection for face recognition","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5576317/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11530694","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5576317/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Random sampling LDA incorporating feature selection for face recognition","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"01801236.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.08385S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564178","isNumber":"5576298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564178","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5576298","articleId":"5576317","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5576334,"authors":[{"name":"Chao Deng","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Deng","id":"37575780300"},{"name":"Hong-Min Liu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"firstName":"Hong-Min","lastName":"Liu","id":"37537727100"},{"name":"Zhi-Heng Wang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science & Technology, Henan Polytechnic University, Jiaozuo, China"],"firstName":"Zhi-Heng","lastName":"Wang","id":"37537374400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6531-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6530-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6529-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"5576334","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":177},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Pixel","Artificial neural networks","Algorithm design and analysis","Filtering algorithms","Optical filters","Image restoration"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image denoising","image enhancement","neural nets"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["neural network","impulse noise removal","digital images","noise pixels detection","noise free image pixels"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image processing","Impulse noise","Neural network","Local similarity analysis","Image enhancement"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5576334","abstract":"A new noise removal algorithm based on improved neural network, is applied to remove the impulse noise of the digital images.

Information (tool face orientation, temperature, pressure, tilt, azimuth, etc.) which is modulated by means of pulse positioning modulation (PPM) is sent from the bottom of the well to the surface by means of pressure waves in the drilling fluid(the drilling mud). Due to external disturbances, the noise removal before decoding is of great importance for real-time monitoring of bottom hole. Wavelet transform has been used widely in signal de-noising. In this paper, a wavelet based de-noising technique is used to isolate the signals from the noise, and waveform shaping and signal extraction based on the pulse-code information are processed to restore pulse signal more fully and to improve the SNR. Results showed that the effect of the wavelet transform on signal de-noising suppression is good. While waveform reshaping and the signal extraction based on pulse-code information can be more accurate in restoring the pulse signal to facilitate future decoding.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2010.5576341","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2010.5576341","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern

This implies that the WAPA order may be reduced for a same filtering result; and the saved computation time may counteract the computation expenses of the wavelet transform. The faster convergence speed and the lower steady state MSE (or mis-adjustment) can be attributed to the variable step-size scheme adopted in the WAPA, which is much better than the normal variable step-size APAs.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2010.5576397","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564178/5576298/05576397.pdf","startPage":"392","endPage":"397","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2010.5576397","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5576298","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An adaptive filter based on wavelet transform and affine projection algorithm","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5576397","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5576397/","displayDocTitle":"An adaptive filter based on wavelet transform and affine projection algorithm","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11530677","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5576397/","conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An adaptive filter based on wavelet transform and affine projection algorithm","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"03921361.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.072195S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564178","isNumber":"5576298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564178","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5576298","articleId":"5576397","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5576414,"authors":[{"name":"Ya-Hui Wu","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Metrology & Calibration, AVIC Changcheng Institute of Metrology and Measurement, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Ya-Hui","lastName":"Wu","id":"38195779900"},{"name":"Jing-Feng Xue","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Metrology & Calibration, AVIC Changcheng Institute of Metrology and Measurement, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Jing-Feng","lastName":"Xue","id":"38194788600"},{"name":"Da-Zhi Zhang","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Metrology & Calibration, AVIC Changcheng Institute of Metrology and Measurement, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Da-Zhi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38195243100"},{"name":"Xin-Liang Li","affiliation":["National Key Laboratory of Science and Technology on Metrology & Calibration, AVIC Changcheng Institute of Metrology and Measurement, Beijing, China"],"firstName":"Xin-Liang","lastName":"Li","id":"38195696500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6531-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6530-9","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6529-3","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2158-5695"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2158-5709"}],"articleNumber":"5576414","dbTime":"21 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":94},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Continuous wavelet transforms","Indexes","Vibrations","Wavelet analysis","Pattern recognition"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aerospace engines","fault diagnosis","image texture","statistical analysis","vibrations","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["aeroengine rub-impact fault analysis","local binary patterns","statistical characteristics","continuous wavelet transform scalogram","aeroengine vibration signal","local image texture","occurrence histogram"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Aeroengine","Rub-impact","Continuous wavelet transform","Local binary patterns"]}],"abstract":"The local binary patterns statistical characteristics of the continuous wavelet transform scalogram of the aeroengine vibration signal are explored in this paper.

The analysis indicates that these features are suitable to reflect the local information of the scalogram and can reveal the characteristic of vibration signals well.","doi":"10.1109/ICWAPR.2010.5576414","publicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 International Conference on Wavelet Analysis and Pattern Recognition","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564178/5576298/05576414.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICWAPR.2010.5576414","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5576298","startPage":"421","endPage":"426","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Research on aeroengine rub-impact fault analysis based on wavelet transform and the local binary patterns","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5576414","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"Research on aeroengine rub-impact fault analysis based on wavelet transform and the local binary patterns","chronOrPublicationDate":"11-14 July 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5576414/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"11-14 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11530704","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5576414/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Research on aeroengine rub-impact fault analysis based on wavelet transform and the local binary patterns","confLoc":"Qingdao, China","sourcePdf":"04211363.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.044084S","chronDate":"11-14 July 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564178","isNumber":"5576298","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564178","xplore-issue":"5576298","articleId":"5576414","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-08-14"},{"_id":5576475,"authors":[{"name":"Yi Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Yi","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37599081200"},{"name":"Lingling Zhang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Lingling","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38008523300"},{"name":"Chengkai Tang","affiliation":["School of Electronics and Information, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China"],"firstName":"Chengkai","lastName":"Tang","id":"38010184500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5325-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-5326-9","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5576475","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":55},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Noise","Sensors","Uncertainty","Cognitive radio","Mathematical model","Equations","Nakagami distribution"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["access protocols","cognitive radio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["dual-threshold","cooperative sensing","coherent MAC","cognitive radio","collaborative detection method"]}],"abstract":"This paper studies the detection of the primary signal under noise uncertainty.

The reason for it seems to be two-fold. One is that generic higher order fault attacks are very difficult to model and thus finding robust countermeasures is also difficult. Another reason may be that the published experiment was carried out on an outdated 8 bit microcontroller and thus was not perceived as a serious threat to create a sense of urgency in addressing this new menace. In this paper we describe two-fault attacks on protected CRT-RSA implementations running on an advanced 32 bit ARM Cortex M3 core. To our knowledge, this is the first practical result of two fault laser attacks on a protected cryptographic application. Considering that laser attacks are much more accurate in targeting a particular variable, the significance of our result cannot be overlooked.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and

system was designed by IBM in response to a DARPA challenge that called for a high-productivity high-performance computing system. A major innovation in the PERCS design is the network that is built using Hub chips that are integrated into the compute nodes. Each Hub chip is about 580 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n in size, has over 3700 signal I/Os, and is packaged in a module that also contains LGA-attached optical electronic devices. The Hub module implements five types of high-bandwidth interconnects with multiple links that are fully-connected with a high-performance internal crossbar switch. These links provide over 9 Tbits/second of raw bandwidth and are used to construct a two-level direct-connect topology spanning up to tens of thousands of POWER7 chips with high bisection bandwidth and low latency. The Blue Waters System, which is being constructed at NCSA, is an exemplar large-scale PERCS installation. Blue Waters is expected to deliver sustained Petascale performance over a wide range of applications. The Hub chip supports several high-performance computing protocols (e.g., MPI, RDMA, IP) and also provides a noncoherent system-wide global address space. Collective communication operations such as barriers, reductions, and multi-cast are supported directly in hardware. Multiple routing modes including deterministic as well as hardware-directed random routing are also supported. Finally, the Hub module is capable of operating in the presence of many types of hardware faults and gracefully degrades performance in the presence of lane failures.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577310/","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-20 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11534706","htmlLink":"/document/5577310/","conferenceDate":"18-20 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"The PERCS High-Performance Interconnect","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"The PERCS High-Performance Interconnect","confLoc":"Mountain View, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4208a075.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.101044S","chronDate":"18-20 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575319","isNumber":"5575607","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575319","citationCount":"108","xplore-issue":"5575607","articleId":"5577310","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-11"},{"_id":5577317,"authors":[{"name":"Robert Alverson","affiliation":["Cray, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Robert","lastName":"Alverson","id":"38193557700"},{"name":"Duncan Roweth","affiliation":["Cray, Inc., USA"],"firstName":"Duncan","lastName":"Roweth","id":"37448805900"},{"name":"Larry Kaplan","affiliation":["Cray Inc."],"firstName":"Larry","lastName":"Kaplan","id":"38193170800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-8547-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4208-9","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"1550-4794"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2332-5569"}],"articleNumber":"5577317","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":72,"citationCountPatent":8,"totalDownloads":1193},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Bandwidth","Routing","Tiles","Hardware","Synchronization","Payloads","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["mainframes","multiprocessor interconnection networks","network computers","parallel machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Gemini system interconnect","Crays supercomputer system","OS bypass","operating system","direct user completion notification","atomic memory operations"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577317","abstract":"The Gemini System Interconnect is a new network for Cray's supercomputer systems.

These attacks are aimed at disrupting of the normal memory operation through preventing changes of the memory contents. The technique was demonstrated on an EEPROM and Flash memory inside PIC microcontrollers. Then it was improved with a backside approach and tested on a PIC and MSP430 microcontrollers. These attacks can be used for the partial reverse engineering of semiconductor chips by spotting the areas of activity in reprogrammable non-volatile memory. This can assist in data analysis and other types of fault injection attacks later, thereby saving the time otherwise required for exhaustive search. Practical limits for optical fault masking attacks in terms of sample preparation, operating conditions and chip technology are discussed, together with possible countermeasures.","doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2010.18","publicationTitle":"2010 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575321/5575595/05577358.pdf","startPage":"23","endPage":"29","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2010.18","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Optical Fault Masking Attacks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577358/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Optical Fault Masking Attacks","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11530970","htmlLink":"/document/5577358/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Optical Fault Masking Attacks","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4169a023.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063585S","chronDate":"21-21 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575321","isNumber":"5575595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575321","citationCount":"32","xplore-issue":"5575595","articleId":"5577358","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5577362,"authors":[{"name":"Christophe Clavier","affiliation":["Institut D'ing\u00e9nierie Informatique de Limoges (3IL),XLIM, Universit\u00e9 de Limoges, Limoges, France"],"firstName":"Christophe","lastName":"Clavier","id":"38196643700"},{"name":"Benoit Feix","affiliation":["Inside Contactless, Aix-en-Provence, France"],"firstName":"Benoit","lastName":"Feix","id":"37706794300"},{"name":"Georges Gagnerot","affiliation":["Inside Contactless, Aix-en-Provence, France"],"firstName":"Georges","lastName":"Gagnerot","id":"38193657600"},{"name":"Myl\u00e8ne Roussellet","affiliation":["Inside Contactless, Aix-en-Provence, France"],"firstName":"Myl\u00e8ne","lastName":"Roussellet","id":"38193658300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7844-6","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5577362","dbTime":"2 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":24,"citationCountPatent":2,"totalDownloads":661},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577362","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Correlation","Cryptography","Resistance","Power demand","Analytical models","Doped fiber amplifiers","Microprocessors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cryptography","fault diagnosis","integrated circuit design","integrated circuit manufacture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["passive combined attacks","active combined attacks","advanced encryption standards","AES","side channel analysis","tamper resistance","hardware products","security domain","Kocher side-channel","Bellcore researchers","Biham fault attacks","Shamir fault attacks","integrated circuit designers","integrated circuit manufacturers","RSA implementations","side-channel countermeasures","fault protections","symmetric cryptosystems"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Advanced Encryption Standard","Collision Fault Analysis","Correlation Side Channel Analysis"]}],"doi":"10.1109/FDTC.2010.17","publicationTitle":"2010 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Workshop on Fault Diagnosis and Tolerance in Cryptography","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575321/5575595/05577362.pdf","startPage":"10","endPage":"19","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/FDTC.2010.17","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5575595","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Passive and Active Combined Attacks on AES Combining Fault Attacks and Side Channel Analysis","abstract":"Tamper resistance of hardware products is currently a very popular subject for researchers in the security domain. Since the first Kocher side-channel (passive)attack, the Bellcore researchers and Biham and Shamir fault (active) attacks, many other side-channel and fault attacks have been published. The design of efficient countermeasures still remains a difficult task for IC designers and manufacturers as they must also consider the attacks which combine active and passive threats. It has been shown previously that combined attacks can defeat RSA implementations if side-channel countermeasures and fault protections are developed separately instead of being designed together.

To detect manipulations, countermeasures have been proposed. In the case of AES, most countermeasures deal with the non-linear and the linear part separately, which either leaves vulnerable points at the interconnections or causes different error detection rates across the algorithm. In this paper, we present a way to achieve a constant error detection rate throughout the whole algorithm. The use of extended AN+B codes together with redundant table lookups allows to construct a countermeasure that provides complete protection against adversaries who are able to inject faults of byte size or less.

Errors occurring in the cryptographic algorithms have been shown to be extremely dangerous, since powerful attacks can exploit few of them to recover the full secrets. Most of the resistance techniques to perturbation attacks have relied so far on the detection of faults. We present in this paper another strategy, based on the resilience against fault attacks. The core idea is to allow an erroneous result to be outputted, but with the assurance that this faulty information conveys no information about the secrets concealed in the chip. We first underline the benefits of FIR: false positive are never raised, secrets are not erased uselessly in case of uncompromising faults injections, which increases the card lifespan if the fault is natural and not malevolent, and FIR enables a high potential of resistance even in the context of multiple faults. Then we illustrate two families of fault injection resilience (FIR) schemes suitable for symmetric encryption. The first family is a protocol-level scheme that can be formally proved resilient. The second family mobilizes a special logic-level architecture of the cryptographic module. We notably detail how a countermeasure of this later family, namely dual-rail with precharge logic style, can both protect both against active and passive attacks, thereby bringing a combined global protection of the device. The cost of this logic is evaluated as lower than detection schemes. Finally, we also give some ideas about the modalities of adjunction of FIR to some certification schemes.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577368/","chronOrPublicationDate":"21-21 Aug. 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"21-21 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5577368/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11530973","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Fault Injection Resilience","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fault Injection Resilience","confLoc":"Santa Barbara, CA, USA","sourcePdf":"4169a051.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.105844S","chronDate":"21-21 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575321","isNumber":"5575595","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575321","citationCount":"19","xplore-issue":"5575595","articleId":"5577368","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5577679,"authors":[{"name":"Kaleem Ahmad","affiliation":["Institute Industrial IT, OWL University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Kaleem","lastName":"Ahmad","id":"37528427800"},{"name":"Uwe Meier","affiliation":["Institute Industrial IT, OWL University of Applied Sciences, Lemgo, Germany"],"firstName":"Uwe","lastName":"Meier","id":"37301196000"},{"name":"Halina Kwasnicka","affiliation":["Wroclaw University of Technology, Wroclaw, Poland"],"firstName":"Halina","lastName":"Kwasnicka","id":"37595321700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5886-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5885-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5577679","dbTime":"25 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":342},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Frequency shift keying","Frequency measurement","Object recognition","Power measurement","Wireless LAN"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fuzzy logic","signal classification"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["fuzzy logic based signal classification","cognitive radios","standard wireless technologies","secondary user","radio systems"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577679","doi":"10.4108/ICST.CROWNCOM2010.9239","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","abstract":"Cognitive radio (CR) is being considered as a promising technology to improve the spectral usage and coexistence behavior of radio systems. The CR can work as a secondary user (SU) in coexistence with primary user (PU) systems without generating harmful interference for them. However, the performance of a SU greatly depends on its abilities to become aware of its radio environment. The more knowledge a CR can acquire from PU systems, the better it will be equipped to optimize its performance in a coexistence environment. Ideally, it would like to classify the PU systems with respect to existing `known standards'. Research has been done in the area of signal classification with respect to modulations.

At the same time, implementations are moving from traditional fixed hardware architectures towards software, allowing more efficient development. Today, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and regular desktop computers are fast enough to handle complete baseband processing chains, and there are several platforms, both open-source and commercial, providing such solutions.

Formation of coalitions enables the CRs to increase their achievable throughput, under the detection probability constraint, while also taking into account the overhead in sensing reports combining. In the proposed game, CRs form coalitions either to increase their individual gains (selfish coalition formation) or to maximize the overall gains of the group (altruistic coalition formation). We find that the altruistic coalition formation solution yields significant gains in terms of reduced average false alarm probability and increased average throughput per CR as compared to the selfish and non-cooperative solutions. Given a target detection probability for a coalition, we also propose an SNR dependent target detection probability for individual CRs in a coalition and analyze its impact on the average throughput per CR. Finally, we also analyze the impact of the cost of distributed cooperative sensing on the cooperative strategies of CRs.","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.4108/ICST.CROWNCOM2010.9208","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577658","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5565551/5577658/05577711.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On selfish and altruistic coalition formation in cognitive radio networks","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577711/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 June 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5577711/","displayDocTitle":"On selfish and altruistic coalition formation in cognitive radio networks","conferenceDate":"9-11 June 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11530569","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On selfish and altruistic coalition formation in cognitive radio networks","confLoc":"Cannes, France","sourcePdf":"083paper9208.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.063497S","chronDate":"9-11 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5565551","isNumber":"5577658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5565551","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5577658","articleId":"5577711","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5577736,"authors":[{"name":"Wael Guib\u00e8ne","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Wael","lastName":"Guib\u00e8ne","id":"37596570600"},{"name":"Aawatif Hayar","affiliation":["Mobile Communications Department, Eurecom Institute, Sophia-Antipolis, France"],"firstName":"Aawatif","lastName":"Hayar","id":"37294011100"},{"name":"Monia Turki","affiliation":["ENIT-Unit\u00e8 Signaux et Syst\u00e8mes, Tunis, Tunisia"],"firstName":"Monia","lastName":"Turki","id":"37391468600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5886-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5885-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5577736","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Detectors","Complexity theory","Mathematical model","Cognitive radio","Equations","Noise"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["calculus","cognitive radio","differential algebraic equations","telecommunication network reliability"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["distribution discontinuities detection","algebraic technique","spectrum sensing","cognitive radio","algebraic detection","operational calculus","differential algebra","energy detection technique","reliability"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","sensing algorithm","energy detector","distribution discontinuities","algebraic detector","change point detection"]}],"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distribution discontinuities detection using algebraic technique for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio","doi":"10.4108/ICST.CROWNCOM2010.9183","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577658","endPage":"5","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5565551/5577658/05577736.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.4108/ICST.CROWNCOM2010.9183","startPage":"1","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577736","abstract":"In this paper\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">1</sup>\n, we propose a new Spectrum Sensing technique for spectrum distribution discontinuities detection using algebraic detection (AD).

By taking the impact of Inter-Cell Interference (ICI) resulting from timing offset into account, the maximization of total information rates is formulated, subject to maximum power constraint as well as interference constraint from Secondary User (SU) to Primary User (PU). Since the channel gain information between SU and PU can't be precisely estimated, the amount of the interference induced by SU to PU is calculated on the basis of an estimated Channel State Information (CSI), which is determined by a prescribed outage probability of primary systems. Simulation results show that FBMC can achieve higher channel capacity than OFDM, which indicates that FBMC is a potential candidate for physical layer data communication in CR context.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Capacity analysis of OFDM / FBMC based Cognitive Radio networks with estimated CSI","publicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Cognitive Radio Oriented Wireless Networks and Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/5565551/5577658/05577745.pdf","startPage":"1","endPage":"5","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577658","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577745","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577745/","chronOrPublicationDate":"9-11 June 2010","displayDocTitle":"Capacity analysis of OFDM / FBMC based Cognitive Radio networks with estimated CSI","conferenceDate":"9-11 June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5577745/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11530613","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Capacity analysis of OFDM / FBMC based Cognitive Radio networks with estimated CSI","confLoc":"Cannes, France","sourcePdf":"062paper9240.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051595S","chronDate":"9-11 June 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5565551","isNumber":"5577658","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5565551","xplore-issue":"5577658","articleId":"5577745","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"ICST","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5577751,"authors":[{"name":"Musbah Shaat","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnolog\u00eda, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Musbah","lastName":"Shaat","id":"37392258400"},{"name":"Faouzi Bader","affiliation":["Centre Tecnol\u00f2gic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC), Parc Mediterrani de la Tecnolog\u00eda, Barcelona, Spain"],"firstName":"Faouzi","lastName":"Bader","id":"37282298800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5886-8","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-5885-1","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2166-5370"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2166-5419"}],"articleNumber":"5577751","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":3,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":524},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chromium","Resource management","OFDM","Complexity theory","Cognitive radio","Interference constraints"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel bank filters","cognitive radio","discrete Fourier transforms","frequency response","OFDM modulation","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["uplink resource allocation algorithm","OFDM","FBMC","multicarrier based cognitive radio systems","orthogonal frequency division multiplexing","filter bank multicarrier system"]}],"abstract":"This paper presents an uplink radio resource allocation algorithm for multicarrier based cognitive radio systems.

The basic motivation for developing such a framework pertains to analyzing the distribution of a sum of squared random variables (RVs) belonging to different families of fading distributions. Following a novel analytical approach stemming from the definition of a common moment generating function (MGF) model for these families of distributions, the probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a general sum of squared RVs are expressed by simple infinite Gamma series expansions. Based on these expressions, the capacity and error probability of MRC/OSTBC over generalized fading channels is thoroughly studied. The developed theory is used to evaluate the performance of OSTBC for a mixed Nakagami-m/Rice fading model and novel analytical results are presented. The accuracy of the derived expressions is validated by extensive Monte Carlo simulations.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"An Exact Performance Analysis of MRC / OSTBC over Generalized Fading Channels","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.09.090282","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5577792/05577797.pdf","startPage":"2486","endPage":"2492","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.09.090282","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577797","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577797/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","displayDocTitle":"An Exact Performance Analysis of MRC / OSTBC over Generalized Fading Channels","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isJournal":true,"volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5577797/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527824","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"An Exact Performance Analysis of MRC / OSTBC over Generalized Fading Channels","sourcePdf":"2486-tc1009-ropokis.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.08239S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5577792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"27","xplore-issue":"5577792","articleId":"5577797","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5577798,"authors":[{"name":"Ruey-Yi Wei","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Ruey-Yi","lastName":"Wei","id":"37279410300"},{"name":"Tzu-Shiang Lin","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Tzu-Shiang","lastName":"Lin","id":"37536265800"},{"name":"Shi-Shan Gu","affiliation":["Department of Communication Engineering, National Central University, Jhong Li, Taiwan"],"firstName":"Shi-Shan","lastName":"Gu","id":"37532256100"}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"0090-6778"},{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"1558-0857"}],"articleNumber":"5577798","dbTime":"12 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":254},"sponsors":[{"packageNumber":0,"name":"IEEE Communications Society","url":"http://www.comsoc.org/"}],"abstract":"In this paper, we derive minimum noncoherent distances of block-coded TAPSK (twisted amplitude and phase shift keying) and 16QAM (quadrature-amplitude modulation), both using linear component codes.

Different from many existing fast but `local' antenna selection algorithms which obtain the sub-optimal channel submatrix by adding or removing one row per step, our algorithm acquires the near-optimal channel matrix by {directly} and {rapidly} searching the maximum-volume submatrix of the original channel matrix. Due to its \"globally searching\" property, our antenna selection algorithm leads to a substantial improvement in the capacity optimality for moderate to high SNRs, and obtains almost the same capacity performance as that of the exhaustive-search-based optimal antenna selection algorithm. Furthermore, the computational load and memory requirement for our antenna selection method are still comparable to those of the existing sub-optimal antenna selection methods.

Adopting the real-valued representation, we provide an optimal receive combiner which maximizes the SINR with a general group size.

In the first method, we develop a completely analytical parameterisation of the whole turbo receiver up to the users' channel decoders. The method which follows the classical framework of extrinsic information transfer charts tracks the evolution of the average mutual information defined at coded bit level and circulating between the multiuser detector and the bank of channel decoders. The modelling of the demapping output in the multiuser detector is based on an explicit calculation of the (conditional) mutual information for each symbol digit in a symbol label under arbitrary (possibly non-uniform) a priori probability distributions on others. Then, shifting in viewpoint and considering user demapping and decoding as a joint process, we present an alternative method which tracks the evolution of the average mutual information defined at symbol level and circulating between the MMSE successive interference based interface and the bank of joint demappers and channel decoders. This allows to avoid the critical issue of parameterising the demapping. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the second method for high-order non-linear mapping.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","pdfPath":"/iel5/26/5577792/05577805.pdf","startPage":"2576","endPage":"2589","publicationTitle":"IEEE Transactions on Communications","doi":"10.1109/TCOMM.2010.09.090436","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/TCOMM.2010.09.090436","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577792","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577805","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Semi-Analytical Performance Prediction Methods for Iterative MMSE-IC Multiuser MIMO Joint Decoding","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Iterative decoding","Decoding","Joints","Receivers","MIMO","Fading","Signal to noise ratio"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["channel coding","fading channels","interference suppression","iterative decoding","least mean squares methods","MIMO communication","multipath channels","multiuser detection"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["iterative MMSE-IC multiuser MIMO joint decoding","semi-analytical performance prediction methods","block fading multipath channels","turbo receiver","channel decoders","extrinsic information transfer charts","multiuser detector","channel decoders","priori probability distributions","user demapping","user decoding","average mutual information","joint demappers","successive interference cancellation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Multiuser MIMO systems","iterative multiuser detection","iterative decoding","performance analysis","convergence analysis","link adaptation","radio resource management"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577805/","chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"Semi-Analytical Performance Prediction Methods for Iterative MMSE-IC Multiuser MIMO Joint Decoding","volume":"58","issue":"9","htmlLink":"/document/5577805/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"September 2010","accessionNumber":"11527833","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Semi-Analytical Performance Prediction Methods for Iterative MMSE-IC Multiuser MIMO Joint Decoding","sourcePdf":"2576-tc1009-visoz.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.154551S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5577792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"23","xplore-issue":"5577792","articleId":"5577805","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5577806,"authors":[{"name":"Marco Di Renzo","affiliation":["Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay, \u00c3\u017dle-de-France, FR"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/26/5577792/5577806/5577806-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Marco Di Renzo (SM'05-AM'07-M'09) was born in L' Aquila, Italy, in 1978.

Although LR-aided linear detectors may collect the same diversity as that collected by the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector, there still exists a performance gap between LR-aided and ML equalizers. One approach to fill this gap is to adopt soft-output detectors. Soft-output detectors enable iterative decoding when error-control codes are employed for a system. In this paper, we propose three LR-aided soft-output detectors with different methods to generate the candidate lists. We compare the performance and complexity of our algorithms with the existing alternatives and show that our methods achieve better performance with lower complexity. The performance-complexity tradeoffs of our proposed algorithms are also studied.

Due to its fundamental and practical importance, there has been an increasing interest in this channel. However, there has been little work that characterizes the fundamental tradeoff between the communication reliability and transmission rate across all signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we consider amplify-and-forward (AF) two-way relaying due to its simplicity. We first derive the random coding error exponent for the link in each direction. From the exponent expression, the capacity and cutoff rate for each link are also deduced. We then put forth the notion of bottleneck error exponent, which is the worst exponent decay between the two links, to give us insight into the fundamental tradeoff between the rate pair and information-exchange reliability in the two-way relay network. As applications of the error exponent analysis to design a reliable AF two-way relay network, we present two optimization framework to maximize the bottleneck error exponent, namely: i) the optimal rate allocation under a sum-rate constraint and its closed-form quasi-optimal solution that requires only knowledge of the capacity and cutoff rate of each link; and ii) the optimal power allocation under a total power constraint and perfect global channel state information, which is shown equivalently to a quasi-convex optimization problem. Numerical results verify our analysis and the effectiveness of the optimal rate and power allocations in maximizing the bottleneck error exponent, i.e. the network information-exchange reliability.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September  2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577811/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"16 September 2010","volume":"58","issue":"9","accessionNumber":"11527844","publicationDate":"September 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5577811/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","isJournal":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","displayDocTitle":"Amplify-and-Forward Two-Way Relay Networks: Error Exponents and Resource Allocation","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Amplify-and-Forward Two-Way Relay Networks: Error Exponents and Resource Allocation","sourcePdf":"2653-tc1009-ngo.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.156565S","chronDate":"September  2010","xplore-pub-id":"26","isNumber":"5577792","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"26","citationCount":"46","xplore-issue":"5577792","articleId":"5577811","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Transaction","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5577860,"authors":[{"name":"Xuan Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information, Yunnan University, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37984834500"},{"name":"Nattapong Wuwong","affiliation":["School of Information, Yunnan University, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Nattapong","lastName":"Wuwong","id":"38193003000"},{"name":"Hao Li","affiliation":["School of Information, Yunnan University, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Hao","lastName":"Li","id":"37657274100"},{"name":"Xuejie Zhang","affiliation":["School of Information, Yunnan University, Yunnan, China"],"firstName":"Xuejie","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37405048500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5577860","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":55,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":6019},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Information Security Risk Management Framework for the Cloud Computing Environments","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05577860.pdf","startPage":"1328","endPage":"1334","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.501","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.501","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Risk management","Security","Clouds","Cloud computing","Monitoring","Book reviews"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computer network security","Internet","risk analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["information security risk management","cloud computing environments","security risks","cloud delivery model","information assets","cloud architectures","security controls","cloud provider","security assessment tool","cloud service models","cloud deployment models","risk mitigation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["cloud computing","risk management framwork"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577860","abstract":"The security risks associated with each cloud delivery model vary and are dependent on a wide range of factors including the sensitivity of information assets, cloud architectures and security controls involved in a particular cloud environment.

Hence, sparse matrix vector product (SpMV) is considered as key operation in engineering and scientific computing. For these applications the optimization of the sparse matrix vector product (SpMV) is very relevant. However, the irregular computation involved in SpMV prevents the optimum exploitation of computational architectures when the sparse matrices are very large. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have recently emerged as platforms that yield outstanding acceleration factors. SpMV implementations for GPUs have already appeared on the scene. This work proposes and evaluates new implementations of SpMV for GPUs called ELLR-T. They are based on the format ELLPACK-R, which allows storage of the sparse matrix in a regular manner. A comparative evaluation against a variety of storage formats previously proposed has been carried out based on a representative set of test matrices. The results show that: (1) the SpMV is highly accelerated with GPUs; (2) the performance strongly depends on the specific pattern of the matrix; and (3) the implementations ELLR-T achieve higher overall performance. Consequently, the new implementations of SpMV, ELLR-T, described in this paper can help to exploit the GPUs, because, they achieve high performance and they can be easily joined in the engineering and scientific computing.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577904/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5577904/","accessionNumber":"11528891","displayDocTitle":"Improving the Performance of the Sparse Matrix Vector Product with GPUs","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improving the Performance of the Sparse Matrix Vector Product with GPUs","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108b146.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.070957S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"68","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5577904","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-19"},{"_id":5577905,"authors":[{"name":"Daniel Kauker","affiliation":["Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Kauker","id":"38193946100"},{"name":"Harald Sanftmann","affiliation":["Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Harald","lastName":"Sanftmann","id":"37392972500"},{"name":"Steffen Frey","affiliation":["Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Steffen","lastName":"Frey","id":"37553894500"},{"name":"Thomas Ertl","affiliation":["Visualization and Interactive Systems Group, University of Stuttgart, Stuttgart, Germany"],"firstName":"Thomas","lastName":"Ertl","id":"37268023800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5577905","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":2,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":120},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Libraries","Discrete Fourier transforms","Memory management","Graphics processing unit","Graphics","Planning"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["coprocessors","discrete Fourier transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["memory saving discrete Fourier transform","GPU Fourier transform libraries","large buffer","separability","NVIDIA","CUFFT library"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Discrete Fourier Transform","Fourier transform","GPGPU"]}],"abstract":"This paper will show an alternative method to compute the two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform. While current GPU Fourier transform libraries need a large buffer for storing intermediate results, our method can compute the same output with far less memory.

As multiple lines can be transformed at once, the available memory on the device can be used to reduce the number of necessary kernel calls drastically. We will also prove that our approach can compete with the timings of the two-dimensional transform provided by NVIDIAs CUFFT library but consumes at the same time far less memory by enabling the transformation of much bigger data sets on the device.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Memory Saving Discrete Fourier Transform on GPUs","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.209","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05577905.pdf","startPage":"1152","endPage":"1157","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.209","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577905","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577905/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Memory Saving Discrete Fourier Transform on GPUs","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5577905/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11528892","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Memory Saving Discrete Fourier Transform on GPUs","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108b152.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.061036S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"2","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5577905","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5577961,"authors":[{"name":"Xin Jin","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Xin","lastName":"Jin","id":"38001628900"},{"name":"Sanghyuk Jung","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Sanghyuk","lastName":"Jung","id":"37536263400"},{"name":"Yong Ho Song","affiliation":["Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Hanyang University, Seoul, South Korea"],"firstName":"Yong Ho","lastName":"Song","id":"37281078500"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5577961","dbTime":"18 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":200},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Flash memory","Buffer storage","Google","File systems","Random access memory","Pollution","Algorithm design and analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["buffer storage","flash memories","NAND circuits"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["SEPL","smart evicted page list buffer","NAND flash storage system","NAND flash memory","write requests","DRAM","buffer management schemes","CFLRU","FARS","buffer replacement algorithm","write intensive pages"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["NAND flash","buffer cache","replacement","write intensive","long-term","metadata","storage system","random access"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577961","abstract":"NAND flash memory has become popular in the consumer market while its success in main storage market is still limited. One of the reasons is that NAND flash suffers severe performance degradation under random write requests, and these requests are inevitable since the complexity of the applications is growing rapidly. One way to mitigate the problem is by applying DRAM as the buffer between host and NAND flash to absorb these requests, and numbers of buffer management schemes such as CFLRU and FARS had been proposed. However, these algorithms do not respect write intensive and long-term pages enough. In this paper, we propose a buffer replacement algorithm with a smart eviction list and a brand new eviction criterion that helps retaining the write intensive pages in the buffer in order to lower down the number of write request into NAND flash memory. Experiments show that SEPL outperforms other algorithms in the traces where random access is dominant.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.297","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05577961.pdf","startPage":"1687","endPage":"1694","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.297","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"SEPL: Smart Evicted Page List Buffer for NAND Flash Storage System","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577961/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"SEPL: Smart Evicted Page List Buffer for NAND Flash Storage System","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5577961/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11529059","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","isConference":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"SEPL: Smart Evicted Page List Buffer for NAND Flash Storage System","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108b687.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06127S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5577961","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5577968,"authors":[{"name":"Nikolaos Alachiotis","affiliation":["Exelixis Laboratory, Department of Computer Science, Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, Germany"],"firstName":"Nikolaos","lastName":"Alachiotis","id":"37393238000"},{"name":"Simon A.

Input/Output (I/O) speeds can become a bottleneck and directly affect the performance of a reconfigurable accelerator since the chip will idle when there are no data available. While PCI Express represents the currently fastest and most expensive solution to connect a FPGA to a general purpose CPU, there exist several applications with I/O requirements for which Gigabit Ethernet is sufficient. To this end, we present the design of an efficient UDP/IP core for PC-FPGA communication that has been designed to occupy a minimum amount of hardware resources on the FPGA. An observation regarding the internet checksum algorithm, allows us to reduce the hardware requirements for computing the checksum. Furthermore, this property also allows for initiating packet transmission immediately, i.e., the UDP/IP core can start a transmission without the requirement of receiving, storing, and processing user data beforehand. The UDP/IP core is available as open-source code. A comparison with related work on UDP/IP core implementations shows that our implementation is significantly more efficient in terms of resource utilization and performance. The experimental results were obtained on a real-world system and we also make available the PC software test application that is used for performance assessment to allow for reproduction of our results.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05577968.pdf","startPage":"1727","endPage":"1734","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.302","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.302","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577968","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Efficient PC-FPGA Communication over Gigabit Ethernet","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Table lookup","IP networks","Clocks","Protocols","Ethernet networks","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","local area networks","microcomputers","microprocessor chips","peripheral interfaces","transport protocols"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["PC-FPGA communication","gigabit ethernet","accelerator device","compute intensive function","I/O speed","PCI express","UDP/IP core","Internet checksum algorithm","open source code","field programmable gate array","personal computer","Internet protocol","user datagram protocol","peripheral component interface"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["FPGA","Gigabit Ethernet","UDP/IP","PC-FPGA communication"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5577968/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Efficient PC-FPGA Communication over Gigabit Ethernet","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5577968/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11529064","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Efficient PC-FPGA Communication over Gigabit Ethernet","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108b727.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.085021S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"31","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5577968","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5577980,"authors":[{"name":"Wei Hu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Wei","lastName":"Hu","id":"37288604400"},{"name":"Binbin Wu","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Binbin","lastName":"Wu","id":"37672143800"},{"name":"Bin Xie","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Xie","id":"37529874800"},{"name":"Tianzhou Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Tianzhou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290411700"},{"name":"Lianghua Miao","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Zhejiang University Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Lianghua","lastName":"Miao","id":"38113897300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5577980","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":134},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5577980","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Pipelines","Computer architecture","Optimization","System-on-a-chip","Latches","Clocks","Delay"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["circuit optimisation","network-on-chip","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["bypass optimization method","network on chip","NoC architecture","multicore SoC","transmission bypass framework","Splash-2"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network on chip","router","bypass"]}],"abstract":"Network-on-Chip (NoC) is proposed to solve the communication bottleneck for multi-core SoC.

This paper proposes a new architecture: a transmission bypass framework. It adds the bypass path behind the EX stage, an execution stage of the instruction pipeline, to transmit the intermediate results and save transmission time.

Two important parameters, i.e., secondary user interrupting probability and blocking probability are derived using the proposed model. The performance of secondary users in different dynamic spectrum access systems are analyzed and compared. The numerical results show that the performance of secondary users can be improved significantly in dynamic spectrum access under interference temperature constraints comparing to overlay dynamic spectrum access.

The Reconfigurable Logic is logically divided into Reconfigurable Processing Units (RPUs), which are coupled with General Purpose Cores (GPCs) as co-processors via a configurable full crossbar switch. And a RPU-Manager (RPU-M) is designed to manage the RPUs. To verify RMC, a simulation methodology based on the Simics and Virtex 5 FPGA is adopted, which simplifies the simulation and assures the accuracy of the hardware function core. The experimental results of workloads 3-DES, AES and JPEG_ENC show a 2.34X average speedup over software implementation, while the data and control transfer overhead is acceptable.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578048.pdf","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.484","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.484","startPage":"2897","endPage":"2902","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Reconfigurable Processor Architecture Combining Multi-core and Reconfigurable Processing Unit","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578048/","displayDocTitle":"A Reconfigurable Processor Architecture Combining Multi-core and Reconfigurable Processing Unit","htmlLink":"/document/5578048/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","isConference":true,"accessionNumber":"11529068","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Reconfigurable Processor Architecture Combining Multi-core and Reconfigurable Processing Unit","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108c897.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049084S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"9","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578048","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5578096,"authors":[{"name":"Jun Shi","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Faculty of Science & Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Jun","lastName":"Shi","id":"37401085400"},{"name":"Booma Devi Sekar","affiliation":["Department of EEE, Faculty of Science & Technology, University of Macau, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Booma Devi","lastName":"Sekar","id":"38104482300"},{"name":"Ming Chui Dong","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Computer Engineering, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Ming Chui","lastName":"Dong","id":"37420162100"},{"name":"Wai Kei Lei","affiliation":["Institute of Systems and Computer Engineering, Macao, China"],"firstName":"Wai Kei","lastName":"Lei","id":"37406173800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5578096","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":10,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":90},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Accuracy","Fuzzy neural networks","Blood","Training","Medical diagnostic imaging","Biomedical monitoring","Heart"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["diseases","fuzzy neural nets","medical computing","patient diagnosis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cardiovascular diseases detection","hierarchical fuzzy neural networks","hemodynamic parameters","sphygmogram","variance analysis","feature space","fuzzy membership function"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["detect cardiovascular disease","variance analysis","confidence coefficient","cubic interpolation","membership function","hierarchical fuzzy neural networks"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578096","abstract":"For purpose of detecting cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) hierarchically via hemodynamic parameters (HDPs) derived from sphygmogram, a hierarchical fuzzy neural networks (HFNNs) scheme is proposed, which provides a non-invasive way to detect CVDs.

Moreover, the tradeoff between test hardware overhead and fault detection capabilities allows for applying the proposed methodology for an on-line self test mechanism as well as an off-line fault detection strategy.

Compared with grid computing, the focus of resource management problem is transformed to resource virtualization and allocation rather than job decomposition and scheduling. It is more urgent to find better solutions for cloud resource allocation than ever before. Although there have been some research efforts in grid computing, most of them aim at maximizing utility of system and lack of analysis for competition between different users. Some researches consider competition analysis, but they assume that common knowledge is certain and known for every user, which is difficult to be applied in a global distributed cloud environment. In this paper, we hereby propose a new resource pricing and allocation policy where users can predict the future resource price as well as satisfy budget and deadline constraints. Experimental results prove that resource price can gradually converge to an equilibrium state by dynamic games and that cloud users can receive Nash equilibrium allocation proportion without other competitors' bidding information.","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578214.pdf","startPage":"195","endPage":"202","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Resource Pricing and Equilibrium Allocation Policy in Cloud Computing","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.70","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.70","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578214","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578214/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Resource Pricing and Equilibrium Allocation Policy in Cloud Computing","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11529267","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5578214/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Resource Pricing and Equilibrium Allocation Policy in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108a195.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.062504S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"71","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578214","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5578217,"authors":[{"name":"Matthew Woitaszek","affiliation":["National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO, USA"],"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Woitaszek","id":"37694900000"},{"name":"Henry M.

To evaluate the competitiveness of our computing center with cloud computing resources, we develop a comprehensive system utilization charging model similar to that used by Amazon EC2 and apply the model to our current resources and planned procurements. For our current resource, we find that charging for computational time may be appropriate, but that charging for data traffic between the supercomputer and the storage/front-end systems would result in negligible additional revenue. Similarly, charging for data storage capacity at currently typical commercial rates yields insufficient revenue to offset the acquisition and operation of the storage. However, when we extend the analysis to a capacity cluster scheduled for deployment in the first half of 2010 that will be made available to users through batch, Grid, and cloud interfaces, we find that the resource will be competitive with current and anticipated cloud rates.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Developing a Cloud Computing Charging Model for High-Performance Computing Resources","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.72","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578217.pdf","startPage":"210","endPage":"217","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.72","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578217","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578217/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Developing a Cloud Computing Charging Model for High-Performance Computing Resources","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578217/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11529269","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Developing a Cloud Computing Charging Model for High-Performance Computing Resources","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108a210.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.07219S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578217","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5578265,"authors":[{"name":"Xing Zhang","affiliation":["Key Laboratory of Universal Wireless Communications, Ministry of Education, Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China","Wireless Signal Processing and Network Lab, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, P.

In communication systems from the users' point of view, utility is a good metric to describe the satisfaction of services, the objective of this paper is to improve the total utility of all the system users, and guarantee their Quality of Service(QoS). Three types of services are considered, including the Hard QoS (HQ), the Best Effort (BE) and the Soft QoS (SQ) traffics. First we analyze the utility and hard outage characteristics of the wireless services, and then we introduce a new concept, i.e., \\emph{soft outage} to further improve the SQ users' performance. Afterwards, two wireless resource allocation schemes, i.e., the Hard Outage Allocation (HOA) and Soft Outage Allocation (SOA) schemes are proposed corresponding to the hard outage and the soft outage, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed resource allocation algorithms can greatly improve the system performance.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.434","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578265.pdf","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.434","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","startPage":"2556","endPage":"2561","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"On the Study of Radio Resource Allocation of Heterogeneous Services with Soft QoS Traffics in OFDMA-based Wireless Networks","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578265","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","displayDocTitle":"On the Study of Radio Resource Allocation of Heterogeneous Services with Soft QoS Traffics in OFDMA-based Wireless Networks","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578265/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11528929","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5578265/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"On the Study of Radio Resource Allocation of Heterogeneous Services with Soft QoS Traffics in OFDMA-based Wireless Networks","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108c556.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0615S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578265","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5578274,"authors":[{"name":"W.

Hardware tasks can be dynamically placed on and removed from reconfigurable platforms. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA) provide partially runtime reconfiguration (PRTR) at runtime. However, this reconfiguration will lead to more time overhead. An efficient algorithm to manage empty space is necessary for online task placement on a PRTR FPGA. This paper first proposes a data structure to maintain information about the available free area and then presents a novel approach to find candidate locations for online FPGA placement. Experimental results show that the approach proposed here is better than similar approaches to find locations for task placement.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.428","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578274.pdf","startPage":"2509","endPage":"2515","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.428","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Novel Approach for Finding Candidate Locations for Online FPGA Placement","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578274","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578274/","displayDocTitle":"A Novel Approach for Finding Candidate Locations for Online FPGA Placement","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11528968","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578274/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Novel Approach for Finding Candidate Locations for Online FPGA Placement","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108c509.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058834S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578274","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5578297,"authors":[{"name":"Zhiqiang Que","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhiqiang","lastName":"Que","id":"37317961300"},{"name":"Yongxin Zhu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yongxin","lastName":"Zhu","id":"37310652700"},{"name":"Xuan Wang","affiliation":["Department of Electronic & Computer Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China"],"firstName":"Xuan","lastName":"Wang","id":"37540085300"},{"name":"Jibo Yu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Jibo","lastName":"Yu","id":"37897582900"},{"name":"Tian Huang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Tian","lastName":"Huang","id":"38003563800"},{"name":"Zhe Zheng","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Zhe","lastName":"Zheng","id":"38008740900"},{"name":"Li Yang","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Li","lastName":"Yang","id":"37675781100"},{"name":"Feng Zhao","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Feng","lastName":"Zhao","id":"37673450900"},{"name":"Yuzhuo Fu","affiliation":["School of Microelectronics, Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China"],"firstName":"Yuzhuo","lastName":"Fu","id":"37414382100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5578297","dbTime":"16 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":508},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Algorithm design and analysis","Libraries","Random access memory","Hardware","Logic gates","Pixel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computerised tomography","digital signal processing chips","field programmable gate arrays","image reconstruction","medical image processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["medical CT algorithm","stand alone FPGA","workflow management","SysGen","Simulink","Xilinx","mathworks","system generator","DSP","digital signal processing","field programmable gate array","image reconstruction","algorithm mapping","system IO library","resource allocation"]}],"abstract":"Xilinx and Mathworks jointly proposed System Generator (SysGen) and Simulink to accelerate development of DSP (digital signal processing) style applications on Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) chips.

A lot of effort has recently been directed into developing practical algorithms for IF based, multi-standard Software Radio receiver architectures. Significant issues exist in developing an efficient implementation suitable for the processing of multiple standards through a single architecture with the help of sample rate conversion filters. In this context, this paper presents a practical implementation of multi-stage sample rate conversion in multi-standard software radios. This work includes complete design and subsequent implementation of sample rate conversion filters on a Xilinx Vertex II Pro FPGA Board. A high-level design methodology has been adopted that involves direct HDL code generation from algorithm description for testing and implementation on the FPGA. This approach is helpful in the rapid development and prototyping of multi-standard Software Radio and is facilitative in the initial stages of the design. The synthesized circuit utilizes 2% area of the Vertex II Pro FPGA. Power consumption reduction of around 2% is also visible in comparison to previously proposed reconfigurable decimation filter architecture.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"FPGA-based Implementation of Efficient Sample Rate Conversion for Software Defined Radios","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.410","startPage":"2387","endPage":"2390","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.410","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578301.pdf","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578301","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578301/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"FPGA-based Implementation of Efficient Sample Rate Conversion for Software Defined Radios","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578301/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11529133","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"FPGA-based Implementation of Efficient Sample Rate Conversion for Software Defined Radios","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108c387.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.051415S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578301","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5578306,"authors":[{"name":"Shan Ding","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China"],"firstName":"Shan","lastName":"Ding","id":"37650730800"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5578306","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":5,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":178},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578306","abstract":"FlexRay provides a communication infrastructure for future generation high-speed control applications in vehicle such as advanced powertrain, chassis, and by-wire systems.

Smart and fast vision systems are frequently required in industrial environments to automatically detect and inspect objects, e.g. on an assembly line. The chip die has a size of 25 mm\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">2</sup>\n and is manufactured using a 0.18 um CMOS technology. The chip processes binary images with a maximum resolution of 320x240 pixels (QVGA) supplied by a separate closely-linked image sensor array. It is possible to process an image in multiple cycles where a set of morphological operations can be subsequently combined depending on the image processing problem. In addition the chip is able to compute more complex user-defined programs, e.g. to skeletonize images. The output data can be a preprocessed image or projection representations in horizontal, vertical and diagonal direction, which reduces the data amount. Therefore a faster image post-processing is supported, e.g. to calculate object's momenta. The chip is driven by a 40 MHz clock. As result a base morphological operation including image in/output needs only 250 us. For even faster data in/output a ROI (region of interest) can be defined. Two standardized interfaces (JTAG, SPI) allow to parameterize as well as to program the circuit.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.50","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578424.pdf","startPage":"33","endPage":"40","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.50","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Dynamically Programmable Image Processor for Compact Vision Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578424","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578424/","displayDocTitle":"Dynamically Programmable Image Processor for Compact Vision Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11528980","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578424/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Dynamically Programmable Image Processor for Compact Vision Systems","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108a033.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.109989S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578424","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5578430,"authors":[{"name":"Jie Yang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Jie","lastName":"Yang","id":"38195499400"},{"name":"Like Yan","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Like","lastName":"Yan","id":"37293527300"},{"name":"Lihan Ju","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Lihan","lastName":"Ju","id":"37845095600"},{"name":"Yuan Wen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Yuan","lastName":"Wen","id":"38004353400"},{"name":"Shaobin Zhang","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Shaobin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"38195013400"},{"name":"Tianzhou Chen","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, University of Zhejiang, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China"],"firstName":"Tianzhou","lastName":"Chen","id":"37290411700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5578430","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":72,"totalDownloads":498},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Homogeneous NoC-based FPGA: The Foundation for Virtual FPGA","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578430.pdf","startPage":"62","endPage":"67","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.54","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.54","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Field programmable gate arrays","Chromium","Nickel","Table lookup","Routing","Hardware"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["field programmable gate arrays","network-on-chip","reconfigurable architectures"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["homogeneous NoC-based FPGA architecture","virtual FPGA","reconfigurable computing","field programmable gate arrays","I-O resources","resource utilization"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["network on chip","field programmable gates array","reconfiguration"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578430","abstract":"Reconfigurable computing based on FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) has been a promising solution to improve the performance with high flexibility.

Parallel computing is one of the most promising solutions to overcoming the computational challenge. In this paper, we target at parallelizing k-Means, which is one of the most popular clustering algorithms, by using the widely available Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Different from existing GPU-based k-Means algorithms, we observe that data dimension is an important factor that should be taken into consideration when parallelizing k-Means on GPUs. In particular, we use two different strategies for low-dimensional data sets and high-dimensional data sets respectively, in order to make the best use of the power of GPUs. For low-dimensional data sets, we exploit GPU on-chip registers to significantly decrease data access latency. For high-dimensional data sets, we design a novel algorithm which simulates matrix multiplication and exploits GPU on-chip registers and also on-chip shared memory to achieve high compute-to-memory-access ratio. As a result, our GPU-based k-Means algorithm is three to eight times faster than the best reported GPU-based algorithm.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.60","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578441.pdf","startPage":"115","endPage":"122","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.60","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Speeding up K-Means Algorithm by GPUs","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578441/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Speeding up K-Means Algorithm by GPUs","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11529027","htmlLink":"/document/5578441/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Speeding up K-Means Algorithm by GPUs","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108a115.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.06601S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"34","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578441","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5578453,"authors":[{"name":"Yaqiong Li","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yaqiong","lastName":"Li","id":"37310414000"},{"name":"Yongbing Huang","affiliation":["Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing, CN"],"firstName":"Yongbing","lastName":"Huang","id":"38195173000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5578453","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":7,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":302},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"TMemCanal: A VM-oblivious Dynamic Memory Optimization Scheme for Virtual Machines in Cloud Computing","abstract":"In current virtualized cloud platforms, resource provisioning strategy is still a big challenge. Provisioning will gain low resource utilization based on peak workload, and provisioning based on average work loads will sacrifice the potential revenue of cloud customers because of bad user experiences. VM-based performance isolation also restrains resource flowing on demand. As to memory, this eventually results in under-loaded memory and over-loaded memory in the same data center. This paper proposes a VM-oblivious dynamic memory optimization scheme, TMemCanal, which leverages under-loaded memory in a data center to accommodate the needs of loaded memory dynamically in a transparent fashion. TMemCanal is able to identify the under-loaded memory located in different VMs and reuse it in a way of memory flowing without any modification to their Guest OSs. We implemented TMemCanal through extending Xen hypervisor and evaluated using SpecWeb 2005 and LinkPack Benchmarks. Our evaluation shows that TMemCanal can efficiently save memory up to 50% with an overhead less than 7%. Our case study of server consolidation also shows TMemCanal can promote the performance of memory-intensive services up to 400%.","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Memory management","Random access memory","Servers","Resource management","Prefetching","Optimization","Kernel"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","operating systems (computers)","resource allocation","software performance evaluation","storage management","virtual machines"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["TMemCanal","virtual machine-oblivious dynamic memory optimization scheme","cloud computing","virtualized cloud platforms","resource provisioning strategy","resource utilization","peak workload","average work loads","performance isolation","under-loaded memory","Guest OSs","Xen hypervisor","SpecWeb 2005","LinkPack Benchmarks"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["under-loaded memory","Xen"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578453","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.68","startPage":"179","endPage":"186","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578453.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.68","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578453/","displayDocTitle":"TMemCanal: A VM-oblivious Dynamic Memory Optimization Scheme for Virtual Machines in Cloud Computing","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11529081","htmlLink":"/document/5578453/","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"TMemCanal: A VM-oblivious Dynamic Memory Optimization Scheme for Virtual Machines in Cloud Computing","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108a179.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064293S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578453","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5578502,"authors":[{"name":"Leila Ismail","affiliation":["Computer Science and Software Engineering, Petroleum and Chemical Engineering, United Arab Emirates University, Al-Ain, UAE"],"firstName":"Leila","lastName":"Ismail","id":"37302037100"},{"name":"J.H.

In particular, we introduce an automatic parallel load balanced distributed computational model for the matrix-vector multiplication which heavily contributes to the reduction of the complexity of the CG. Our algorithm allows an equal distribution of the CG computation on the number of workers involved in the parallel computing.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.494","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","startPage":"2958","endPage":"2963","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.494","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578502.pdf","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Mathematical model","Load modeling","Complexity theory","Computational modeling","Reservoirs","Indexes","Equations"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","conjugate gradient methods","hydrocarbon reservoirs","iterative methods","linear algebra","matrix multiplication","parallel processing","petroleum industry","resource allocation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["automatic load balanced distribution model","conjugate gradient method","one dimensional one phase oil reservoir simulation","reservoir algebraic equation","iterative linear solvers","automatic parallel computational loading balancing model","matrix vector multiplication","CG complexity reduction"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Parallel Computing","Oil Reservoir Simulator","Conjugate Gradient (CG) Method","Distributed Systems"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","displayDocTitle":"Toward an Automatic Load Balanced Distribution Model in Conjugate Gradient Method for One-Dimensional One-Phase Oil Reservoir Simulation","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578502/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578502/","accessionNumber":"11529206","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Toward an Automatic Load Balanced Distribution Model in Conjugate Gradient Method for One-Dimensional One-Phase Oil Reservoir Simulation","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108c958.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.064429S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578502","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5578532,"authors":[{"name":"Jiayin Li","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Jiayin","lastName":"Li","id":"37598851400"},{"name":"Meikang Qiu","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, USA"],"firstName":"Meikang","lastName":"Qiu","id":"37288778000"},{"name":"Jianwei Niu","affiliation":["State Key Laboratory of Software Develop.

Stochastic resource allocation can guarantee certain quality of the services (QoS). In heterogeneous embedded system resource allocation, execution time distributions of different tasks on cores are predicted before scheduling. The difference between actual execution time and estimated execution time may lead to allocations which are not robust. In this paper, we present an evaluation of impacts of inaccurate information on resource allocation. We propose a systematic measure of the robustness degradation and evaluate how inaccurate probability parameters affect the robustness of resource allocations. Furthermore, we compare the performance of three widely used greedy heuristics when using the inaccurate information.","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.452","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578532.pdf","startPage":"2692","endPage":"2697","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.452","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impacts of Inaccurate Information on Resource Allocation for Multi-Core Embedded Systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578532/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Impacts of Inaccurate Information on Resource Allocation for Multi-Core Embedded Systems","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11529297","htmlLink":"/document/5578532/","isStaticHtml":true,"dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impacts of Inaccurate Information on Resource Allocation for Multi-Core Embedded Systems","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108c692.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.088887S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578532","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5578537,"authors":[{"name":"Ryo Aoki","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryo","lastName":"Aoki","id":"37720307200"},{"name":"Shuichi Oikawa","affiliation":["Department of Computer Science, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan"],"firstName":"Shuichi","lastName":"Oikawa","id":"37276927100"},{"name":"Ryoji Tsuchiyama","affiliation":["Fixstars Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Ryoji","lastName":"Tsuchiyama","id":"37990133100"},{"name":"Takashi Nakamura","affiliation":["Fixstars Corporation, Tokyo, Japan"],"firstName":"Takashi","lastName":"Nakamura","id":"37714755600"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7548-3","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-7547-6","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-0-7695-4108-2","isbnType":""}],"articleNumber":"5578537","dbTime":"8 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":12,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":527},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Hybrid OpenCL: Connecting Different OpenCL Implementations over Network","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Runtime","Kernel","Bridges","Context","Graphics processing unit","Resource management","Parallel processing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["multiprocessing systems","parallel programming"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["hybrid OpenCL","OpenCL implementations","runtime system","data processing time"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Heterogeneous computing","OpenCL","Middleware","HPC","GPGPU"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578537","abstract":"We are developing Hybrid OpenCL, which enables the connection between different OpenCL implementations over the network.

Heterogenous environment is characterized by various devices which vary greatly with respect to the capacities of computation and communication, architectures, memorizes and power. As an important extension of Hadoop, LATE MapReduce scheduling algorithm takes heterogeneous environment into consideration. However, it falls short of solving the crucial problem - poor performance due to the static manner in which it computes progress of tasks. Consequently, neither Hadoop nor LATE schedulers are desirable in heterogeneous environment. To this end, we propose SAMR: a Self-Adaptive MapReduce scheduling algorithm, which calculates progress of tasks dynamically and adapts to the continuously varying environment automatically. When a job is committed, SAMR splits the job into lots of fine-grained map and reduce tasks, then assigns them to a series of nodes. Meanwhile, it reads historical information which stored on every node and updated after every execution. Then, SAMR adjusts time weight of each stage of map and reduce tasks according to the historical information respectively. Thus, it gets the progress of each task accurately and finds which tasks need backup tasks. What's more, it identifies slow nodes and classifies them into the sets of slow nodes dynamically. According to the information of these slow nodes, SAMR will not launch backup tasks on them, ensuring the backup tasks will not be slow tasks any more. It gets the final results of the fine-grained tasks when either slow tasks or backup tasks finish first. The proposed algorithm is evaluated by extensive experiments over various heterogeneous environment. Experimental results show that SAMR significantly decreases the time of execution up to 25% compared with Hadoop's scheduler and up to 14% compared with LATE scheduler.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information

In frequency- selective fading channels, no matter the area of the scatterer zones is fixed or not, scatterer density can affect the channel capacity to a certain degree that depends on the length of the coding block of the transmitted signals.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Impact of Scatterer Density on the Performances of Double-Scattering MIMO Channels","publicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","doi":"10.1109/CIT.2010.466","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 10th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology","pdfPath":"/iel5/5575291/5577816/05578550.pdf","startPage":"2793","endPage":"2799","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/CIT.2010.466","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5577816","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578550","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578550/","chronOrPublicationDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Impact of Scatterer Density on the Performances of Double-Scattering MIMO Channels","conferenceDate":"29 June-1 July 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578550/","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"June 2010","accessionNumber":"11529321","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Impact of Scatterer Density on the Performances of Double-Scattering MIMO Channels","confLoc":"Bradford, UK","sourcePdf":"4108c793.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071915S","chronDate":"June 29 2010-July 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5575291","isNumber":"5577816","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5575291","xplore-issue":"5577816","articleId":"5578550","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-07-24"},{"_id":5578649,"authors":[{"name":"Bhim Singh","affiliation":["University of Roorkee, Roorkee, India"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/5563734/5578626/5578649/5578649-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Bhim Singh (SM'99) was born in Rahamapur, India, in 1956.

Its reconfigurability has made this mode of digital circuit synthesis more popular among the system designers. But unlike other ICs it provides a restricted hardware structure for circuit implementation and hence the computer aided design (CAD) software is also constrained. The placement being a very vital step in the design process needs to be performed optimally for high performance circuits. In these work novel techniques for placement based on constricted particle swarm optimization (PSO), adaptive PSO and time varying inertia weight (TVIW) PSO are proposed. The results of simulation reveal a competitive performance of the circuits implemented. The technique proposed here also offer faster convergence to a placement solution. The performance of a single BCD counter circuit is studied in details by using the different PSO algorithms.

The channel matrix is decomposed into a number of independent orthogonal modes of excitation, which we will refer to as eigenmodes of the channel. The transmit precoding is performed by multiplying the input symbols with unitary matrix to produce the transmit beamforming, and the precoded symbols are transmitted over Rayleigh fading channel. At the receiver, combining process is performed for receiving symbols by using maximum ratio combiner (MRC), and the receiver shaping is performed to retrieve the original input symbols by multiplying the received signal with conjugate transpose of the unitary matrix. Furthermore, we derive expressions for average bit error rate (BER) for BPSK and average symbol error rate (SER) for M-QAM. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SVD-based beamforming schemes yield the better performance when compare to the other beamforming method.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578715/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11530742","htmlLink":"/document/5578715/","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"BER performance of SVD-based transmit beamforming with various modulation techniques","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"BER performance of SVD-based transmit beamforming with various modulation techniques","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"C591.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.075435S","chronDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5563734","isNumber":"5578626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5563734","citationCount":"8","xplore-issue":"5578626","articleId":"5578715","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5578716,"authors":[{"name":"Sanjay Singh","affiliation":["Department of Information and Communication Technology, Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal, India"],"firstName":"Sanjay","lastName":"Singh","id":"37601004800"},{"name":"M.

The analysis of channel estimation in the presence of interference is also done. Least square frequency domain (LS_Freq), least square time domain (LS_Time), maximum likelihood (ML) and minimum mean square error estimation (MMSE) techniques are focused for different bandwidth by varying the number of resource blocks used in OFDM structure of LTE system. As number of pilots increases with increasing bandwidth, performance of the estimator increases. Computer simulations are used in the comparisons. Linear Interpolation is performed to get the channel estimation of data symbols. Theoretical results are derived for LS_Time and ML techniques. MMSE performs well at low SNR. LS_Time and ML performs well at high SNR as they use the knowledge of number of channel taps. We achieve interference mitigation using channel estimation using repeated interference features obtained from the two types of pilot symbols used with different pilot density. This technique not only makes the channel estimation robust to the time-selectivity of the channel but also reduces the number of pilot subcarriers needed to estimate the channel.","pdfPath":"/iel5/5563734/5578626/05578723.pdf","startPage":"113","endPage":"118","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578723","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578723","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578723","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Channel estimation","OFDM","Interference","Downlink","Maximum likelihood estimation","Frequency domain analysis"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["3G mobile communication","channel estimation","interference (signal)","least mean squares methods","maximum likelihood estimation","wireless channels"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pilot aided channel estimation methods","time-selective channels","LTE downlink system","time varying mobile environments","least square frequency domain","least square time domain","maximum likelihood estimation","minimum mean square error estimation","resource blocks","OFDM structure","linear interpolation","data symbols","channel taps","interference mitigation","interference features","time-selectivity","pilot subcarriers"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Channel estimation","LS","ML","MMSE","Linear Interpolation","Interference mitigation","pilot density","time-selective channel"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578723/","displayDocTitle":"Performance analysis of pilot aided channel estimation methods for LTE system in time-selective channels","accessionNumber":"11530747","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5578723/","isStaticHtml":true,"conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2010","isConference":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Performance analysis of pilot aided channel estimation methods for LTE system in time-selective channels","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"C52.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.052719S","chronDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5563734","isNumber":"5578626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5563734","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5578626","articleId":"5578723","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-20"},{"_id":5578724,"authors":[{"name":"K Rajesh Shetty","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Department, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"K","lastName":"Rajesh Shetty","id":"38193141700"},{"name":"U Sripati","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Department, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"U","lastName":"Sripati","id":"37283936800"},{"name":"H Prashantha Kumar","affiliation":["Electronics & Communication Department, National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Mangalore, India"],"firstName":"H","lastName":"Prashantha Kumar","id":"38194743800"},{"name":"B.

They have been used for code storage as well as data storage. The storage density associated with these devices has increased tremendously in the past few years. This has necessitated very dense packing of data bits on the device. This gives rise to increased Raw Bit Error Rate (RBER) as a result of Inter Symbol Interference (ISI) between bits stored in adjacent cells. This necessitates the use of powerful error control codes to guarantee information integrity. With the increase in density of data storage, the raw bit error rate (RBER) associated with the storage device increases. Error Control Coding (ECC) can be used to reduce the RBER to acceptable values so that these devices can be employed to store information in applications where data corruption is unacceptable. In this paper, we describe the synthesis of BCH codes based on memory models proposed by the semiconductor industry. These codes have better error correcting capability than the codes used in current practice.","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5563734/5578626/05578724.pdf","startPage":"119","endPage":"124","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Synthesis of BCH codes for enhancing data integrity in flash memories","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578724","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578724","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578724","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578724/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Synthesis of BCH codes for enhancing data integrity in flash memories","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11530751","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5578724/","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Synthesis of BCH codes for enhancing data integrity in flash memories","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"C53.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.071197S","chronDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5563734","isNumber":"5578626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5563734","xplore-issue":"5578626","articleId":"5578724","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5578726,"authors":[{"name":"Sandhya Yogi","affiliation":["Department of Electrical Engg., National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Sandhya","lastName":"Yogi","id":"37991324900"},{"name":"K.R.

From the results it can be noted that the proposed algorithm improves the classification capability of the FLANNs in differentiating the received data.","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578726","startPage":"107","endPage":"112","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578726","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578626","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5563734/5578626/05578726.pdf","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A PSO based Functional Link Artificial Neural Network training algorithm for equalization of digital communication channels","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578726/","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"A PSO based Functional Link Artificial Neural Network training algorithm for equalization of digital communication channels","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578726/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11530753","publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A PSO based Functional Link Artificial Neural Network training algorithm for equalization of digital communication channels","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"C51.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.05404S","chronDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5563734","isNumber":"5578626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5563734","citationCount":"18","xplore-issue":"5578626","articleId":"5578726","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5578727,"authors":[{"name":"Shrishail Hiremath","affiliation":["Department of ECE, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Shrishail","lastName":"Hiremath","id":"38196791900"},{"name":"Sarat Kumar Patra","affiliation":["Department of ECE, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India"],"firstName":"Sarat","lastName":"Kumar Patra","id":"37368553400"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6653-5","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6651-1","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6652-8","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2164-7011"}],"articleNumber":"5578727","dbTime":"13 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":16,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":367},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Cognitive radio","Accuracy","Training","Testing","Artificial neural networks","Data models"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["cognitive radio","fuzzy neural nets","radio spectrum management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["transmission rate prediction","cognitive radio","adaptive neural fuzzy inference system","high data rate wireless applications","fifth generation intelligent radio","predictive data rate"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Cognitive radio","spectrumhole","cognition cycle","ANFIS"]}],"abstract":"Advances in applications demanding high data rate wireless applications and existing wireless system upgrading has lead to scarcity in spectrum. Unlicensed new technologies like Digital video broadcast (DVB), Digital audio broadcast (DAB), internet, WiMAX etc. launched recently are reaching thousands of customers at rapid speed. Most of the primary spectrum is assigned, so it is becoming very difficult to find spectrum for either new services or expanding existing infrastructure. Present government policies do not allow unlicensed access of licensed spectrum, constraining them instead to heavily populated, interference-prone frequency bands. Cognitive Radio systems promise to handle this situation by utilizing intelligent software packages that enrich their transceiver with radio-awareness, adaptability and capability to learn. In this paper, we present the working of the fifth generation intelligent radio that is Cognitive Radio (CR) system which works on predictive data rate and propose ANFIS based learning scheme to introduce intelligence in it. The performance of this is seen to be comparable to neural network based scheme with reduced complexity.","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578727","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5563734/5578626/05578727.pdf","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578626","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578727","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","startPage":"92","endPage":"97","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Transmission rate prediction for Cognitive Radio using Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578727","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Transmission rate prediction for Cognitive Radio using Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578727/","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578727/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","accessionNumber":"11530754","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Transmission rate prediction for Cognitive Radio using Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"C43.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.0428S","chronDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5563734","isNumber":"5578626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5563734","citationCount":"16","xplore-issue":"5578626","articleId":"5578727","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5578731,"authors":[{"name":"Koshy George","affiliation":["Department of Telecommunication Engineering, P.E.S.

These networks are more amenable for hardware implementation compared to the conventional super-resolution techniques. The objective is to use these estimated directions to extract the signals.

The RWA problem is reducible to Graph Coloring problem in polynomial time and hence found to be NP-Complete. So, Soft Computing techniques along with Heuristic methods are applicable to solve large instances of the RWA problem. In this work, we propose new ILP formulations by imposing additional constraints to the objective function, thereby, establishing lightpaths which are immune to signal distortion and crosstalk. Furthermore, we develop constraints to make the lightpaths avoid creating loops while traversing between the Source-Destination node pair. After modeling the RWA problem as an Optimization problem, we focus on applying Genetic Algorithms (GA) to find a sub-optimal solution for the RWA problem.","doi":"10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578737","startPage":"41","endPage":"46","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","pdfPath":"/iel5/5563734/5578626/05578737.pdf","publicationTitle":"2010 5th International Conference on Industrial and Information Systems","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICIINFS.2010.5578737","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578626","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Solving large problem instances of the RWA problem using Genetic Algorithms","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Routing","Biological cells","Optical wavelength conversion","Wavelength assignment","Wavelength division multiplexing","Bandwidth"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["communication complexity","genetic algorithms","graph colouring","integer programming","linear programming","telecommunication channels","telecommunication network routing","wavelength division multiplexing"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["genetic algorithm","integer linear programming","ILP formulation","routing and wavelength assignment","RWA problem","wavelength division multiplexed network","WDM network","all-optical channel","noninterfering wavelength channel","lightpath","graph coloring","polynomial time","NP-complete","soft computing","heuristic method","source-destination node pair","optimization problem"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Integer Linear Programming","Routing and Wavelength Assignment","Wavelength Division Multiplexing","lightpath","Genetic Algorithms"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578737/","chronOrPublicationDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","displayDocTitle":"Solving large problem instances of the RWA problem using Genetic Algorithms","isConference":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578737/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"July 2010","dateOfInsertion":"16 September 2010","conferenceDate":"29 July-1 Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11530764","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Solving large problem instances of the RWA problem using Genetic Algorithms","confLoc":"Mangalore, India","sourcePdf":"C21.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049062S","chronDate":"July 29 2010-Aug. 1 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5563734","isNumber":"5578626","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5563734","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5578626","articleId":"5578737","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-09-18"},{"_id":5578740,"authors":[{"name":"U.

Generally speaking, when the cellular mobile radio system is functioning, and the transmitting terminal is located in close proximity of the human head-say less than 7 mm-a large fraction of the power radiated by the mobile radio is absorbed by the user. During the last 10 years, the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) value has been used as the standard dosimetric parameter in defining the energy absorbed by the human body exposed to electromagnetic radiation. In particular, in the RF and microwave frequency bands, the absorbed Elctromagnetic (EM) energy mainly contributes to the heating of the tissues[1]. The value of 4W/kg is accepted worldwide as the threshold for the induction of biological thermal effects[2]. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of near-field exposure, specifically the SAR values induced by the cellular Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) antenna. Towards this end, we employ the Specific Anthropomorphic Mannequin (SAM) Head Model, comprised of a low-loss dielectric material, whose shape and dimension parameters are selected from the 90\n<sup xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\">th</sup>\n-percentile anthropometic data corresponding to the adult male head, as tabulated by the US Army[3]. The model is made of two parts: the phantom shell and flat phantom. The phantom shell thickness is approximately 2mm and the dimensions of the flat phantom are about 22.5 cm \u00d7 15 cm in the major and minor axes, respectively[4]. We evaluate the SAR values at two frequencies in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band, namely 2.255 GHz and 2.4 GHz that are the operating frequencies of WiFi, Bluetooth and ZigBee. It is well known that computing and measuring the SAR values in different electromagnetic environments is a highly complex problem.

Why is the eye fovea so small? Strong evidence supports the idea that in humans foveation is mainly guided by task-specific skills, but how these are learned is still an important open problem. We designed and implemented a simulated neural eye-arm coordination model to study the development of attention control in a search-and-reach task involving simple coloured stimuli. The model is endowed with a hard-wired bottom-up attention saliency map and a top-down attention component which acquires task-specific knowledge on potential gaze targets and their spatial relations. This architecture achieves high performance very fast. To explain this result, we argue that: (a) the interaction between bottom-up and top-down mechanisms supports the development of task-specific attention control skills by allowing an efficient exploration of potentially useful gaze targets; (b) bottom-up mechanisms boast the exploitation of the initial limited task-specific knowledge by actively selecting areas where it can be suitably applied; (c) bottom-up processes shape objects representation, their value, and their roles (these can change during learning, e.g. distractors can become useful attentional cues); (d) increasing the size of the fovea alleviates perceptual aliasing, but at the same time increases input processing costs and the number of trials required to learn. Overall, the results indicate that bottom-up attention mechanisms can play a relevant role in attention control, especially during the acquisition of new task-specific skills, but also during task performance.","doi":"10.1109/DEVLRN.2010.5578839","publicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 9th International Conference on Development and Learning","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 IEEE 9th International Conference on Development and Learning","pdfPath":"/iel5/5570121/5578820/05578839.pdf","startPage":"231","endPage":"237","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/DEVLRN.2010.5578839","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578820","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"How can bottom-up information shape learning of top-down attention-control skills?","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578839","pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"18-21 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578839/","displayDocTitle":"How can bottom-up information shape learning of top-down attention-control skills?","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11536411","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5578839/","conferenceDate":"18-21 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"How can bottom-up information shape learning of top-down attention-control skills?","confLoc":"Ann Arbor, MI, USA","sourcePdf":"ICDL201037.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.065427S","chronDate":"18-21 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5570121","isNumber":"5578820","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5570121","citationCount":"7","xplore-issue":"5578820","articleId":"5578839","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5578872,"authors":[{"name":"Brenna D.

People's movement behaviors are strongly affected by their social interactions with each other, which, however, are not sufficiently considered in most existing mobility models. Recent studies in social network theory have provided many theoretical and experimental results, which are useful and powerful for modeling the realistic social dimension of human mobility. In this article we present a novel human mobility model based on heterogeneous centrality and overlapping community structure in social networks. Instead of extracting communities from artificially generated social graphs, our model manages to construct the k-clique overlapping community structure which satisfies the common statistical features observed from distinct real social networks. This approach achieves a good trade-off between complexity and reality. The simulation results of our model exhibit characteristics observed from real human motion traces, especially heterogeneous human mobility popularity, which has significant impact on data forwarding schemes but has never been considered by existing mobility models.","doi":"10.1109/MNET.2010.5578912","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5578907","startPage":"6","endPage":"13","pdfPath":"/iel5/65/5578907/05578912.pdf","publicationTitle":"IEEE Network","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Network","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/MNET.2010.5578912","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Using social network theory for modeling human mobility","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Communities","Social network services","Periodic structures","Mobile communication","Data models","Computational modeling","Human factors"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["graph theory","mobile communication","mobile computing","social networking (online)","social sciences"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["social network theory","human mobility modeling","data forwarding protocols","mobile network","social interaction","People movement behavior","social graph","k-clique overlapping community structure"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","isDynamicHtml":true,"chronOrPublicationDate":"September-October  2010","displayDocTitle":"Using social network theory for modeling human mobility","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5578912/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"volume":"24","issue":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5578912/","isJournal":true,"accessionNumber":"11533694","publicationDate":"September-October 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Using social network theory for modeling human mobility","sourcePdf":"005YANGLAYOUT.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.081742S","chronDate":"September-October  2010","xplore-pub-id":"65","isNumber":"5578907","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"65","citationCount":"60","xplore-issue":"5578907","articleId":"5578912","contentTypeDisplay":"Magazines","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Magazine","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"},{"_id":5578934,"authors":[{"name":"Guo-lei Qiao","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Huaihai Institute of Technology, Lianyungang, China"],"firstName":"Guo-lei","lastName":"Qiao","id":"37088635815"},{"name":"Zi-jian Dong","affiliation":["School of Electronic Engineering, Huaihai Institute of Technology, Lianyungang, China"],"firstName":"Zi-jian","lastName":"Dong","id":"37087859837"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6542-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6539-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6541-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-7505"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-7491"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-7491"}],"articleNumber":"5578934","dbTime":"3 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":145},"formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Design of structured LDPC codes with quasi-cyclic and rotation architecture","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5578934","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Clocks","Binary phase shift keying"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["computational complexity","parity check codes"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["structured LDPC codes","low density parity check codes","dual-diagonal structure","parity-check bits","linear computational complexity","quasicyclic architecture","quasirotation architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["quasi-cyclic","rotation structure","low density parity check (LDPC) codes"]}],"abstract":"Quasi-cyclic low density parity check (LDPC) codes and rotation LDPC codes are investigated in this paper, based on which, a new class of well-structured LDPC codes are proposed.

How to reduce the memory consumption effectively without compromising identification accuracy is still challenging. In this paper, an adaptive method combining sampling and data streaming counting is proposed, called FSPLC(feedback sampling probabilistic lossy counting). Based on the history information in the flow counter table, FSPLC can adjust the sampling frequency dynamically, and also adapt to the real-time traffic changes. Comparison with state-of-the-art algorithms based on real Internet traces suggests that FSPLC is remarkably efficient and accurate.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) can also be regarded as an optimization algorithm by message-passing, which makes it possible to combine Log-BP algorithm with PSO. PSO was introduced into Log-BP algorithm by regarding all messages that bit nodes send to check nodes as the swarm with each message individually as a particle. Move the particles around in the search-space by certain iterations in each BP iteration processing, guided by the two best current values respectively found by particles themselves and that of the whole swarm. Those two best values were continually updated in each PSO iteration. In this way, the output of decoder is more consistent with accurate input sequence, in other words, the decoder performance was improved.

This method can significantly reduce the amount of sensors and the system complexity. We also adopt the block compressed sensing method for parallel imaging and reducing the data storages. Finally, we propose a non-convex set shrinking iteration (NCSHI) algorithm for reconstruction process. The algorithm uses the adaptive threshholding in the iteration process.

Different methods and algorithms are developed and proposed in recent years to improve intrusion detection systems. The most important issue in current systems is that they are poor at detecting novel anomaly attacks. These kinds of attacks refer to any action that significantly deviates from the normal behaviour which is considered intrusion. This paper proposed a model to improve this problem based on data mining techniques. Apriori algorithm is used to predict novel attacks and generate real-time rules for firewall. Apriori algorithm extracts interesting correlation relationships among large set of data items. This paper illustrates how to use Apriori algorithm in intrusion detection systems to cerate a automatic firewall rules generator to detect novel anomaly attack. Apriori is the best-known algorithm to mine association rules.

The k nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) is one easy and efficient machine learning method for cancer classification and the parameter k is crucial. In this paper, we integrate minimum spanning tree (MST) and k nearest neighbor algorithm (k-NN) for cancer classification. The MST is designed for the selection of parameter k and the nearest neighbors for k-NN. Firstly we build a minimum spanning tree (MST) based on Euclidean distance between each two samples for gene expression data only including one unknown class sample. Secondly for unknown class sample in the gene expression data, we find the connected samples and then apply majority vote principle. Thirdly if there are tied votes then we expend the connected samples with the nearest neighbors for unknown class sample until all the samples are expended or the class for unknown sample is obtained. This hybrid algorithm is referred to as MSTNN. The hybrid algorithm MSTNN is compared with k-NN and other 3 existing classification algorithms on CNS dataset, Colon dataset and Lung dataset, 3 binary class gene expression datasets and 3 multi-class gene expression datasets: Leukemia1, Leukemia2, and Leukemia3 involving human cancers. The MSTNN algorithm improves 5.65% better than k-NN on average LOOCV accuracy and 13.80% better than k-NN on testing datasets classification average accuracy, and achieves the best performance in all the 5 algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed MSTNN algorithm is feasible to classify human cancers.","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A hybrid algorithm of minimum spanning tree and nearest neighbor for classifying human cancers","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","doi":"10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579426","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564353/5579103/05579426.pdf","startPage":"V5-585","endPage":"V5-589","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579426","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5579103","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5579426","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5579426/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"A hybrid algorithm of minimum spanning tree and nearest neighbor for classifying human cancers","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isConference":true,"volume":"5","htmlLink":"/document/5579426/","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11537730","isStaticHtml":true,"isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A hybrid algorithm of minimum spanning tree and nearest neighbor for classifying human cancers","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"rp139Vol5M2194.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.049587S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564353","isNumber":"5579103","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564353","citationCount":"3","xplore-issue":"5579103","articleId":"5579426","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5579493,"authors":[{"name":"Miao Wu","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Miao Wu","id":"38194913100"},{"name":"Ting-Jie Lu","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Ting-Jie Lu","id":"38195003300"},{"name":"Fei-Yang Ling","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Fei-Yang Ling","id":"38192638500"},{"name":"Jing Sun","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Jing Sun","id":"38194229700"},{"name":"Hui-Ying Du","affiliation":["School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing, China"],"lastName":"Hui-Ying Du","id":"37979141300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6542-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6539-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6541-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-7505"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-7491"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-7491"}],"articleNumber":"5579493","dbTime":"6 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":62,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":11256},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Computer architecture"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet","telecommunication network management"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["Internet architecture","three-layer structure","logical layered architecture","telecommunication management network","five-layer architecture"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Internet of Things","architecture","five-layer","Internet","Telecommunications"]}],"abstract":"The Internet of Things is a technological revolution that represents the future of computing and communications.

The methodology adopted to enhance reliability uses the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and historical data of the network, such as the severity of the potential contingencies in each branch. Due to a large number of possible configurations and the need of an efficient search, the optimization is made through an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) with adaptive crossover and mutation probabilities, and with other new features. The method analyses the RDS considering in a first step, the absence of investment, and in a second step, the possibility of placing a limited number of new tie-switches, defined by a decision agent, in certain branches. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the analysis of a 69 bus RDS.","doi":"10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579500","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564353/5579090/05579500.pdf","startPage":"V4-325","endPage":"V4-329","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579500","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5579090","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Improved genetic algorithm for loss and simultaneously reliability optimization in radial distribution systems","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5579500/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Improved genetic algorithm for loss and simultaneously reliability optimization in radial distribution systems","isConference":true,"volume":"4","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","accessionNumber":"11537330","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5579500/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","isStaticHtml":true,"xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Improved genetic algorithm for loss and simultaneously reliability optimization in radial distribution systems","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"rp081Vol4M1095.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.111833S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564353","isNumber":"5579090","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564353","xplore-issue":"5579090","articleId":"5579500","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5579502,"authors":[{"name":"Ting-Fang Yu","affiliation":["School of Mechanical and electronic Engineering, Nanchang University, Jiangxi Province, China; 330031"],"firstName":"Ting-Fang","lastName":"Yu","id":"37088171783"},{"name":"Chun-Hua Peng","affiliation":["School of Electrical & Electronics Engineering, East China Jiaotong University, Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, China; 330013"],"firstName":"Chun-Hua","lastName":"Peng","id":"37632946300"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6542-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6539-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6541-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-7505"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-7491"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-7491"}],"articleNumber":"5579502","dbTime":"5 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":1,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":333},"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5579502","abstract":"In the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for the problem of economic load dispatch (ELD) in power plant There are some problems such as premature convergence of PSO, how to deal with constraints of the problem are need to be addressed.

Obtained results for a sample structure are compared with exact values.","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5579584/","isStaticHtml":true,"accessionNumber":"11537209","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5579584/","publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"displayDocTitle":"Analyzing multi-story buildings using hopfield neural network","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Analyzing multi-story buildings using hopfield neural network","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"rp129Vol3M3500.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.073753S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564353","isNumber":"5579079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564353","xplore-issue":"5579079","articleId":"5579584","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5579586,"authors":[{"name":"Bin Zhang","affiliation":["College of Information Science and Engineering, Shandong University of Science and Technology, SUST, Qingdao, China"],"firstName":"Bin","lastName":"Zhang","id":"37598205100"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6542-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6539-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6541-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-7505"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-7491"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-7491"}],"articleNumber":"5579586","dbTime":"11 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":4,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":671},"abstract":"Image fusion is one of the important techniques to enhance image information. A novel pixel-level image fusion scheme is presented based on multiscale decomposition. The wavelet transform is used to construct the wavelet coefficients of fused image using multiple operators according to different fusion rules. Comparison of fusion results of visible image and infrared image is given. It shows that the proposed method based on local area energy of each pixel can achieve better fusion performance than other usual fusion rules, avoiding losing information and improving the resolution and the special quality of image. Then the fused image is more suitable for human vision or machine perception.","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564353/5579079/05579586.pdf","startPage":"V3-649","endPage":"V3-653","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","doi":"10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579586","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579586","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5579079","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5579586","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Study on image fusion based on different fusion rules of wavelet transform","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Image resolution","Entropy","Image reconstruction"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["image fusion","image resolution","wavelet transforms"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["pixel-level image fusion scheme","wavelet transform","multiscale decomposition","wavelet coefficients","machine perception"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Image fusion","Wavelet transform","Fusion rules","Local area energy"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5579586/","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Study on image fusion based on different fusion rules of wavelet transform","isConference":true,"volume":"3","htmlLink":"/document/5579586/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11537211","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Study on image fusion based on different fusion rules of wavelet transform","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"rp152Vol3M372.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.086587S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564353","isNumber":"5579079","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564353","citationCount":"4","xplore-issue":"5579079","articleId":"5579586","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-06"},{"_id":5579641,"authors":[{"name":"Lin Zuo","affiliation":["School of Computer Science and Engineering, UESTC, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Lin Zuo","id":"37853005000"},{"name":"Zhang Yi","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Zhang Yi","id":"37267126100"},{"name":"Jiancheng Lv","affiliation":["College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China"],"lastName":"Jiancheng Lv","id":"38196570000"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6542-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6539-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6541-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-7505"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-7491"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-7491"}],"articleNumber":"5579641","dbTime":"4 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":142},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Chaos","Educational institutions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["feedback","independent component analysis","iterative methods","learning systems","Lyapunov methods","neurocontrollers","nonlinear control systems","stability","time series"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["chaos control","learning algorithms","ICA neural networks","independent component analysis","bifurcation","periodic oscillation","stability transformation method","chaos feedback control","iterative map","time series diagrams","Lyapunov exponent","dynamical system","convergence control"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["ICA neural network","chaos control","STM","Lyapunov exponent"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5579641","abstract":"Independent component analysis (ICA) neural network is an important method for separating the mixed signal into independent components.

The most challenge in fingerprint positioning is how to reduce the number of training samples and high time consumption with no significant degradation in location accuracy. To deal with this problem, we propose a micro-cell-based radio map construction method based on spatial correlation of collected signal samples and spatial diversity. We present how to apply these properties to improve positioning accuracy and reduce time consumption of constructing a metropolitan-scale radio map. To further enhance the positioning accuracy and reduce latency for real-time positioning, we propose an unequal weighting fast matching algorithm to exploit temporal-spatial diversity and spatial continuity of the objects' movement trajectory. The practical implementation of positioning mobile device at different speeds in urban environments is described and conducted. Experimental results show that our algorithms can significantly improve the performance of WLAN-based fingerprint positioning system.","doi":"10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579787","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564353/5579162/05579787.pdf","startPage":"V6-441","endPage":"V6-445","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579787","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5579162","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A novel approach for fingerprint positioning based on spatial diversity","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5579787","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5579787/","displayDocTitle":"A novel approach for fingerprint positioning based on spatial diversity","volume":"6","isConference":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11537527","isStaticHtml":true,"htmlLink":"/document/5579787/","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A novel approach for fingerprint positioning based on spatial diversity","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"rp104Vol6M3107.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.082349S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564353","isNumber":"5579162","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564353","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5579162","articleId":"5579787","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-02"},{"_id":5579794,"authors":[{"name":"Qi-li Guo","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, 710072"],"firstName":"Qi-li","lastName":"Guo","id":"38123145100"},{"name":"Chao Sun","affiliation":["Institute of Acoustical Engineering, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China, 710072"],"firstName":"Chao","lastName":"Sun","id":"37291762700"}],"isbn":[{"format":"Electronic ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6542-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"Print ISBN","value":"978-1-4244-6539-2","isbnType":""},{"format":"CD","value":"978-1-4244-6541-5","isbnType":""}],"issn":[{"format":"Electronic ISSN","value":"2154-7505"},{"format":"Print ISSN","value":"2154-7491"},{"format":"CD","value":"2154-7491"}],"articleNumber":"5579794","dbTime":"19 ms","metrics":{"citationCountPaper":0,"citationCountPatent":0,"totalDownloads":194},"keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Broadband communication","Sensor arrays","Sensors","Design methodology","Array signal processing","Gratings","Broadband antennas"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["array signal processing","optimisation"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonuniform linear arrays","wideband constant beamwidth beamformer","asymptotic theory design method","optimization method"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["constant beamwidth beamformer","non-uniform linear array","low sidelobe"]}],"pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5579794","doi":"10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579794","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","abstract":"A method of designing wideband constant beamwidth beamformer (WCBB) with non-uniform linear arrays is proposed in this paper.

Myanmar has no inter-word space and it make the tokenizing task difficulties. Therefore, to recognize the word, we implement with FSA. Segmentation is a major problem because of no delimiter. If there were errors in segmentation, this will cause subsequence failure in further NLP processes. Segmentation is also an essential preprocessing task for Natural Language Processing, such as Machine Translation, Information Retrieval etc. In this system, the Rule Based Heuristic Approach and Statistical Approach are used with corpus based dictionary.

In order to solve the problems of PF, this paper integrates distributed genetic algorithms (DGAs) and PF, and puts forward the distributed genetic resampling particle filter (DGRPF). This method divides all particles into several subpopulations to parallel execute particle filtering. Several genetic operators such as crossover, mutation, selection and migration are adopted to optimize the resampling process, which can effectively suppress degeneracy phenomenon, increase particles diversity, and make PF easy to execute in the distributed processor. By software simulation, DGRPF is compared with several existed PF algorithms in the tracking performance, estimation accuracy and computation efficiency, and the effectiveness of DGRPF has been verified.","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5579085","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579807","publicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","displayPublicationTitle":"2010 3rd International Conference on Advanced Computer Theory and Engineering(ICACTE)","pdfPath":"/iel5/5564353/5579085/05579807.pdf","startPage":"V2-32","endPage":"V2-37","doi":"10.1109/ICACTE.2010.5579807","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Distributed genetic resampling particle filter","pubTopics":[{"name":"Computing and Processing"}],"publisher":"IEEE","chronOrPublicationDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","displayDocTitle":"Distributed genetic resampling particle filter","isConference":true,"volume":"2","conferenceDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","htmlLink":"/document/5579807/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Aug. 2010","accessionNumber":"11537704","dateOfInsertion":"20 September 2010","isDynamicHtml":true,"htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5579807/","xploreDocumentType":"Conference Publication","openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Distributed genetic resampling particle filter","confLoc":"Chengdu, China","sourcePdf":"rp010Vol2M1169.pdf","content_type":"Conferences","mlTime":"PT0.058619S","chronDate":"20-22 Aug. 2010","xplore-pub-id":"5564353","isNumber":"5579085","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"conferences","publicationNumber":"5564353","citationCount":"1","xplore-issue":"5579085","articleId":"5579807","contentTypeDisplay":"Conferences","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Conference","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-12-17"},{"_id":5579969,"authors":[{"name":"Hassen Fourati","affiliation":["CReSTIC-URCA, UFR SEN, Reims Champagne Ardenne University, Reims, France"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/7361/5613115/5579969/5579969-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Hassen Fourati (S'09) received the B.

This work is applied in bio-logging, an interdisciplinary research area at the intersection of animal behavior and bioengineering. The proposed approach combines a quaternion-based nonlinear filter with the Levenberg Marquardt Algorithm (LMA). The algorithm has a complementary structure design that exploits measurements from a three-axis accelerometer, a three-axis magnetometer, and a three-axis gyroscope. Attitude information is necessary to calculate the animal's DBA in order to evaluate its energy expenditure. Some numerical simulations illustrate the nonlinear filter performance. Some quantitative assessments prove this efficiency such as the time constant of the filter ( ) and the rms magnitude of the quaternion error ( ). Moreover, the effectiveness of the algorithm is experimentally demonstrated. In the experiments a domestic animal is equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit (MTi-G), which provides a truth attitude for comparison with the complementary nonlinear filter. The rms difference between the filter and MTi-G outputs in the free movement experiments is within 0.392 rms on roll, 0.577 rms on pitch, and 2.521 rms on yaw.","displayPublicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","pdfPath":"/iel5/7361/5613115/05579969.pdf","startPage":"233","endPage":"244","publicationTitle":"IEEE Sensors Journal","doi":"10.1109/JSEN.2010.2053353","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JSEN.2010.2053353","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5613115","pdfUrl":"/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=5579969","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"A Nonlinear Filtering Approach for the Attitude and Dynamic Body Acceleration Estimation Based on Inertial and Magnetic Sensors: Bio-Logging Application","keywords":[{"type":"IEEE Keywords","kwd":["Estimation","Nonlinear filters","Magnetometers","Gyroscopes","Accelerometers","Magnetic separation","Quaternions"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Controlled Indexing","kwd":["accelerometers","biomechanics","biomedical engineering","bioMEMS","estimation theory","gyroscopes","magnetic sensors","magnetometers","medical signal processing","nonlinear filters"]},{"type":"INSPEC: Non-Controlled Indexing","kwd":["nonlinear filtering","dynamic body acceleration estimation","rigid body orientation","inertial sensors","magnetic sensors","biologging","animal behavior","bioengineering","quaternion-based nonlinear filter","Levenberg Marquardt algorithm","three-axis accelerometer","three-axis magnetometer","three-axis gyroscope","inertial measurement unit","attitude estimation"]},{"type":"Author Keywords ","kwd":["Attitude","bio-logging","complementary nonlinear filter","dynamic body acceleration (DBA)","inertial measurement unit (MTi-G)","MEMS inertial/magnetic sensors"]}],"pubTopics":[{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5579969/","chronOrPublicationDate":"Jan.  2011","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","displayDocTitle":"A Nonlinear Filtering Approach for the Attitude and Dynamic Body Acceleration Estimation Based on Inertial and Magnetic Sensors: Bio-Logging Application","volume":"11","issue":"1","htmlLink":"/document/5579969/","isJournal":true,"isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Jan. 2011","accessionNumber":"11629869","dateOfInsertion":"09 November 2010","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"A Nonlinear Filtering Approach for the Attitude and Dynamic Body Acceleration Estimation Based on Inertial and Magnetic Sensors: Bio-Logging Application","sourcePdf":"jsen-manamanni-2053353-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.10035S","chronDate":"Jan.  2011","xplore-pub-id":"7361","isNumber":"5613115","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"7361","citationCount":"59","xplore-issue":"5613115","articleId":"5579969","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2011","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-10-15"},{"_id":5579983,"authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Sarkas","affiliation":["Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, ONT, Canada"],"bio":{"graphic":"/mediastore_new/IEEE/content/freeimages/4/5584926/5579983/5579983-photo-1-source-small.gif","p":["Ioannis Sarkas received the Diploma degree in electrical engineering from the University of Patras, Greece, in 2006, and the M.A.Sc. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada, in 2010.

The nodes can monitor and sense their environment over time, communicate with each other over a wireless network, and process information that they exchange with each other. They differ from data networks in that the network as a whole may be designed for a specific application. We study the theoretical foundations of such large-scale sensor networks. We address four fundamental organizational and operational issues related to large sensor networks: connectivity, capacity, clocks, and function computation. To begin with, a sensor network must be connected so that information can indeed be exchanged between nodes. The connectivity graph of an ad hoc network is modeled as a random graph and the critical range for asymptotic connectivity is determined, as well as the critical number of neighbors that a node needs to connect to. Next, given connectivity, we address the issue of how much data can be transported over the sensor network. We present fundamental bounds on capacity under several models, as well as architectural implications for how wireless communication should be organized. Temporal information is important both for the applications of sensor networks as well as their operation. We present fundamental bounds on the synchronizability of clocks in networks, and also present and analyze algorithms for clock synchronization. Finally, we turn to the issue of gathering relevant information, which sensor networks are designed to do. One needs to study optimal strategies for in-network aggregation of data, in order to reliably compute a composite function of sensor measurements, as well as the complexity of doing so. We address the issue of how such computation can be performed efficiently in a sensor network and the algorithms for doing so, for some classes of functions.","publicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","displayPublicationTitle":"Proceedings of the IEEE","pdfPath":"/iel5/5/5605291/05579999.pdf","startPage":"1828","endPage":"1846","doi":"10.1109/JPROC.2010.2065790","doiLink":"https://doi.org/10.1109/JPROC.2010.2065790","issueLink":"/xpl/tocresult.jsp?isnumber=5605291","formulaStrippedArticleTitle":"Fundamentals of Large Sensor Networks: Connectivity, Capacity, Clocks, and Computation","pubTopics":[{"name":"General Topics for Engineers"},{"name":"Engineering Profession"},{"name":"Aerospace"},{"name":"Bioengineering"},{"name":"Components, Circuits, Devices and Systems"},{"name":"Computing and Processing"},{"name":"Engineered Materials, Dielectrics and Plasmas"},{"name":"Fields, Waves and Electromagnetics"},{"name":"Geoscience"},{"name":"Nuclear Engineering"},{"name":"Robotics and Control Systems"},{"name":"Signal Processing and Analysis"},{"name":"Transportation"},{"name":"Power, Energy and Industry Applications"},{"name":"Communication, Networking and Broadcast Technologies"},{"name":"Photonics and Electrooptics"}],"publisher":"IEEE","htmlAbstractLink":"/document/5579999/","journalDisplayDateOfPublication":"20 September 2010","chronOrPublicationDate":"Nov.  2010","displayDocTitle":"Fundamentals of Large Sensor Networks: Connectivity, Capacity, Clocks, and Computation","htmlLink":"/document/5579999/","isStaticHtml":true,"publicationDate":"Nov. 2010","dateOfInsertion":"18 October 2010","accessionNumber":"11588466","isJournal":true,"volume":"98","issue":"11","xploreDocumentType":"Journals & Magazine","isDynamicHtml":true,"openAccessFlag":"F","title":"Fundamentals of Large Sensor Networks: Connectivity, Capacity, Clocks, and Computation","sourcePdf":"jproc-kumar-2065790-x.pdf","content_type":"Journals & Magazines","mlTime":"PT0.166531S","chronDate":"Nov.  2010","xplore-pub-id":"5","isNumber":"5605291","rightsLinkFlag":"1","contentType":"periodicals","publicationNumber":"5","citationCount":"83","xplore-issue":"5605291","articleId":"5579999","onlineDate":"20 September 2010","contentTypeDisplay":"Journals","publicationYear":"2010","subType":"IEEE Journal","_value":"IEEE","lastupdate":"2021-11-07"}]
